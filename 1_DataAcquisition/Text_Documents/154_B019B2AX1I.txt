Acer Aspire R7-372T-758Q - Flip-hinge design - Core i7 6500U / 2.5 GHz - Win 10 Pro 64-bit - 8 GB RAM - 256 GB SSD - no ODD - 13.3" touchscreen 1920 x 1080 ( Full HD ) - HD Graphics 520 - 802.11ac. Acer's innovative Ezel Aero Hinge features two separate hinge mechanisms that work together to allow seamless transition between six user modes. This fantastic hinge also keeps the display very stable when you use it for touch control. The touchscreen and its back cover are encased in two slices of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 - which makes the top panel very tough, beautiful, and strikingly slender. At only 1 inch thin (17.95 mm) thin, the Aspire R 13 is a joy to pack and carry.The Aspire R 13's touchscreen works perfectly with the Acer Active Pen, which uses Acer Hover Access technology to activate pop-up, tap-on menus. The result is a more intuitive writing experience that is also very convenient, fun and productive.
