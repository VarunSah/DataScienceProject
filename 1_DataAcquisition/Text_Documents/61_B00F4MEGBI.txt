The durable anodized aluminum shell, reinforced by a magnesium-alloy frame, protects your LCD and the internal components. Angled front and side walls give the Alienware 17 an elite and stealth look. And it's designed for maximum performance, with a rear GPU/CPU exhaust vent to manage heat generated inside the system.
