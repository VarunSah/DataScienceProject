The MacBook Pro "Core i7" 2.66 15-Inch (2010/2011) is powered by a 32 nm, dual-core 2.66 GHz Intel "Core i7" I7-620M (Arrandale) processor, with dedicated 256k level 2 cache for each core and a 4 MB shared level 3 cache. This system also supports "Turbo Boost" -- which "automatically boosts the processor speed based on workload" up to 3.33 GHz for this model -- and "Hyper Threading" -- which allows the system to recognize four "virtual cores" or "threads." By default, it is configured with 8 GB of 1066 MHz DDR3 SDRAM (PC3-8500) installed in pairs (two 2 GB modules), a 500 GB SSHD (Solid State Hybrid) hard drive, an 8X DL "SuperDrive", and dual graphics processors -- a NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M with 512 MB of dedicated GDDR3 memory and Intel HD Graphics with 256 MB of RAM shared with the system -- that Mac OS X automatically switches between for better graphics performance and better battery life, respectively, depending on application use.
