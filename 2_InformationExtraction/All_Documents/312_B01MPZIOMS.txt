Designed to replace the MacBook Air, the space gray 13.3" MacBook Pro from Apple is faster and more powerful than the previous generation, yet thinner at 0.59" and lighter at just 3 lb. This system is powered by a 2.0 GHz Intel Core i5 Dual-Core processor that features a burst speed of up to 3.1 GHz, while 8GB of 1866 MHz LPDDR3 RAM helps to ensure smooth multitasking and also allows the computer to quickly access frequently-used files and programs.The 13.3" IPS Retina display features a WQXGA 2560 x 1600 screen resolution with a 227 ppi pixel density. It has LED backlighting with a maximum brightness of 500 nits, and it includes support for the P3 wide color gamut. Integrated Intel Iris Graphics 540 delivers a sharp, clear picture, and you'll also be able to output video to an external display using the system's Thunderbolt 3 ports, which feature native DisplayPort output. One Thunderbolt 3 port can support one multi-panel 5K display at resolutions up to 5120 x 2880 at 60 Hz, or dual 4K displays at resolutions up to 4096 x 2304 at 60 Hz, each of which are able to support over a billion colors.
