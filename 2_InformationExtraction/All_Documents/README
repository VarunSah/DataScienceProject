-Original Documents: 373 
--Filename format: <SerialNumber>_<AmazonASIN>.txt

-Annotation Files: 337 
--Annotation Filename format: <OriginalDocumentFileName>.annot 	 <SerialNumber>_<AmazonASIN>.txt.annot

-Annotation methodology:
--Each original document has a corresponding annotation file.
--Each annotation file contains a series of lines, one for each occurrence of a brand name in the correponding original document. 
--Each line contains a tuple representing the start index and end index of each brand name occurrence. 
--Each index is of the form <LineNumber>.<CharacterNumber>
---For example: If the contents of 3_B002RMQFGW.txt.annot are as follows:
1.0,1.5
1.196,1.201
---then the document 3_B002RMQFGW.txt contains 2 brand names at indices (1.0,1.5) and (1.196,1.201) respectively. In this case, the first 5 letters (1.0,1.5) of the document form a brand name:  


-Documents were annotated using a GUI programmed in python by the team for the information extraction stage (Stage2) of the project.
