Anti-ghost keys ensure your commands are instantaneously and correctly interpreted - even if you hit up to 30 keys simultaneously. And with more macro keys at your disposal, everything is placed at your fingertips - making it easy for you to dominate the battlefield. The unique thermal design of ROG G752 helps prevent internal dust build-up. This exclusive design directs dust into the anti-dust tunnel to keep them away from internal components. This prolongs component lifespan and enhances overall stability of the laptop.
