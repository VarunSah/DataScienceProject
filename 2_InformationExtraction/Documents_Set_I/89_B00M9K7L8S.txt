The Samsung Chromebook is a new computer that helps you get everyday things done faster and easier. It starts in seconds, has virus protection built-in, and runs your favorite Google apps plus thousands more. The Chromebook comes with leading Google products, like Search, Gmail, YouTube and Hangouts, so you can work, play, and do whatever you want, right out of the box. Chromebooks are a unique class of mobile computing devices designed for Web-based tasks. They run the Google Chrome OS, are perfect for browsing the Web, sending and receiving e-mail, and video chatting with friends and family. You can easily share it with multiple people - everyone gets their own files, apps and settings. And it's simple to use. There's no setup, and your files are automatically backed up in the cloud. At just 2.4 pounds, 0.7 inches thin, and with over 6.5 hours of battery life, the Samsung Chromebook can go anywhere you go. It's built to stay cool, so it doesn't need a fan and runs silently. It has a built-in webcam, and dual band Wi-Fi to make it easy to connect to wireless networks. Chromebooks are designed to use Internet apps to access software that lives primarily on the Web rather than inside the computer itself. You can create documents and spreadsheets and edit photos on a Chromebook using Google apps designed for these purposes, but Chromebooks do not run traditional PC software. Instead of storing your documents, videos and photos on your computer, you save them to Google Drive (Google's cloud-based storage service) and you can access them from anywhere there's an Internet connection. If you know you'll want access to a file or photo offline, you can easily save it to the built-in SSD for offline access. Chromebooks are easy to use, and dont slow down over time. They have built-in security, so youre protected against viruses and malware. Chromebooks require almost no setup, so you can go from unboxing to doing in minutes.
