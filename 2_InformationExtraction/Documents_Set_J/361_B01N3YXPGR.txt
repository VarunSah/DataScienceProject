MacBook Air supports ultrafast 802.11ac Wi-Fi. When connected to an 802.11ac base station - including AirPort Extreme and AirPort Time Capsule - wireless performance is up to 3x faster than with the previous generation of Wi-Fi or MacBook Air with 802.11n Wi-Fi2. And your Wi-Fi range improves as well. With Bluetooth technology, you can connect MacBook Air to Bluetooth-enabled devices like speakers and headphones. Even without all the wires, you're totally connected.
