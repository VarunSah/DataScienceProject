N82E16828113984,28-113-984,12/22/2016 3:51:51 PM,David T.,"Buggy printer with some good features, bad twain driver and half full toner",2," I always buy these Brother printers because they always do what I need them to do, and they do it at a reasonable price. Also, the aftermarket toner works reasonably well, and you can often get a model with an 8,000 page toner cartridge. I always wish Brother could just get it right, and they never do, but they get it mostly right.The good: it's quieter than previous models, and text is sharp. Page curl is a bit better controlled. So far, it handles thinner paper and recycled paper OK, which was not the case with older models.More good: I got this basically for the duplex scanner. It scans both sides of the page at the same time, and, unlike Canon, it can do it all the way up to 600 dpi and even farther, interpolated. Using wireless, the scanner repeatedly crashed Adobe Acrobat until I set the scanner mode from Native (correct) to Memory (not correct, but solved the problem). Scans were slow. Wiring it up to the network, and uninstalling everything, then reinstalling, Adobe works fine, the way it should, and the scanner absolutely screamed through a pile of pages. Good stuff. The feeder does sometimes get the angle a bit off, but so do a lot of scanners.So, all in all, I'm sad my 8890DW died, the wireless was way better, but the new one has some good points. If I didn't have the Home Networking wired fix, I would have had to return it as the wireless is too slow. At a shorter distance, it may work OK, but be prepared to change the Adobe setting mentioned above.Copier is OK, not great, fast enough but looks ""digitized""--my ten year old Canon cheap photocopier makes better, darker copies. Duplex options are nice on the copier, and you can feed a big stack through the ADF.A carefully concealed secret lurks in the setup software. If you install the Brother “Status Monitor” along with the driver package, it will run a check of the printer at the end, then it will fix any problems that shouldn’t have happened in the first place. If you don’t tick this box, bad things can happen. And, in my case, I had to reinstall everything. So I recommend installing the monitor, then after a few days you can configure it so that it does not load, or remove it from the startup list. As always, it is a good idea *not* to set it to install automatic updates, this is just a way to get you to buy overpriced supplies, the basics of printing were worked out decades ago."," First off, the Wi-Fi on this model will give you lots of problems if you are not so near the router. Crashes, Adobe Acrobat going crazy, unbelievably slow printing times, install problems. Recommend using a home network plug that uses your house wiring. I switched over to that, and perfect. Well, I had to reinstall all the software. Grr.Okay, that's the ugly.The bad part is that the printer is really pretty much the same speed as the model I bought years ago—the 8890DW. It's reasonably fast, but not like really fast. Other somewhat annoying things are that you really need to set up a static IP. Even then, if it works the first time, consider yourself lucky.For what I paid for my old 8890DW, I would have liked it to last a bit longer. Let's hope this one gives at least 100,000 pages. None of these Brother printers prints a million pages like my HP 4200--it still runs perfect, if a bit squeaky.Update: I'm dinging this review one star for the following reasons. First, the toner cartridge ran out after 1,000 oages, and, yes, they were 5 percent coverage pages. When I wrote Brother to complain, they said that was normal and gave a lecture on why my toner did not behave as expected. Look, I print tons of pages each year, and this was a bad cartridge. So, no biggie, I expected customer service would do the right thing. What was I thinking? Oh, right I was confused. Even Epson replaced my half full ink ink cartridge. Bad service, bad cartridge from Brother.Next, it stays at two stars because as someone who has been involved in computers for decades, it is unacceptable to have a bad twain driver.Lastly, the print quality is just a little but grey compared to my other laser printers. I'm printing on laser paper, it should look black with new (well, empty....) toner and a new drum.Still, not a bad printer but if you don't want hassle look elsewhere.Brother could fix all this, I will update my review if that happens."," Can't recommend it owing to bad twain driver, defective oner and poor customer service",None,None

When printing on anything besides plain paper, the print will come out in the wrong position on the paper and, more seriously, is printed too big. The deviation is about 0.1"" (about 2.5mm) which makes the printer useless for many thing it is actually advertised for.HP support has confirmed the problem - they experienced the exact same deviation as I did when they tested it on their printers. After 3 weeks on and off the phone with HP support (and after the issue was ""elevated""), guess what their answer was? The deviation is within operation parameters and I shouldn't use the printer for things where a correct size is important.

Full Linux support for printing. Web-based configuration provides many, many options. Convenient copier and duplex works well."," Web-based configuration is painful to use. The scan ""shortcuts"" are very poorly designed and hardly useful. Remote scanning (across the network) does not work well at all. I tried all of the following: Scan profiles, scan to shared folder, scan to email, scan to FTP, SANE network scanning. The only one that works is FTP. So...I setup a shared FTP folder on my network.  I really wish I could get SANE to work from my computer, but any attempt to communicate with the scanner over the gigabit network (after installing the Lexmark drivers) results in the application hanging for about an hour."," Not as nice as the Lexmark X544dn that it is replacing. I really wish they had included a USB port for printing/scanning from thumb drive. That was one of the best features of the X544.Very disappointing that scanning is so painful.

Fit perfectly on top of my file cabinet...but I also checked the dimensions prior to ordering- Saw some reviews complaining about noise; it's not quiet, there is a low hum when it is running but I quickly forget about it and usually I just turn it off when I'm not using it. Start up is kind of loud but again, not really louder than my old ink jet. - Would have liked a black model but I suppose I could always paint it if it bothered me that much.- Does NOT come with a printer cable. This is my only real complaint. It isn't necessary if you use the wireless feature that I imagine most people who buy this will, but I thought that seemed a bit ridiculous that the company couldn't throw in a cable.", I have only had it for a month and haven't used it extensively yet.

The scan quality is ok if you use the flatbed scanner. If you're not on Windows 10, the installation is fast and easy.The configuration from the printer's touch screen is fast and easy. My favorite feature has to be the way you can change scan settings on the fly when you are scanning."," This printer does not like Windows 10. The software on the CD, as well as the full software suite on the HP website will run, terminate without giving an error message, but the printer will not print.After talking to the 3rd tech support agent (no, it's not a computer issue, no I'm not going to contact Microsoft), we discoverd that if we install the universal printer driver for PCL5 (even though the printer is PCL6), it will work under Windows 10. I also discovered that if you install the Win8.1 fax driver, you can use it to fax from your computer. The 3rd tech support agent advised me to install the HP scanning app from the Windows store, but it's easier to scan from the machine then creating a Microsoft account.The Automated Document Feeder sucks. It can't feed a piece of paper straight, and often it will maul one of the edges. More then one client has asked me what happened with their documents, which is rather embarrassing. It will also miss pages frequently, and could not feed a 12 page document properly in 5 tries (the scanned document would contain 10 pages tops)."," If you are thinking of buying this for business use, don't. The ADF will damage your customer's documents, and they'll notice. If you are on Windows 10, don't buy this printer unless you like troubleshooting software without error messages, and talking to tech support who will blame their product's faults on your computer, your operating system, your anti-virus software, and who's shift will mysteriously end after they run our of ideas.I'm a IT professional, and for the first time in my life I had to contact tech support to install a printer.

None of them worked as advertised.," None of them have demonstrated the HP quality I have come to expect and look forward to.The first one would not scan.  The installation was simple, easy to follow, and recognized on my network.  The duplex printing was a great feature to cut down on paper use.  The color printing was as good as you would expect for a laser printer.  No complaints here....until I started to scan.  I needed a color duplex scanner with an ADF tray.  I do not have enough space to purchase a dedicated scanner, so I opted for a MFP. When the scanner rollers turned a horrible grinding noise was made, and the rollers did not pick up the paper reliably.  If the rollers did pick up the paper, the page was skewed as it was fed into the scanner, resulting in a crinkled, off center scan of my document- definitely not professional looking and unacceptable to send to clients. Thankfully Newegg's return/replace policy allow me to try out another printer.However, second one will not move past the printer startup routine.  That is, when you turn on the printer, you hear the rollers turn, and the paper tray self-check, then the screen stays white, and the fans in the back continuously spin.  My computers do not even recognize that a printer has been connected.  (perhaps due to the printer stuck within its start up routine and has not activated the network card- but who knows I am not an HP engineer.)I needed a MFP printer, I bought this printer, returned it, received another one, and it has failed too.  This is the first time I have ever experienced this level of incompetence from a printer and/or ANY tech product company.  Get you act together HP. You have pretty much lost a loyal 25 year consumer.I suppose I should purchase the Cannon equivalent instead.",8,9

This is something I might expect from a worn out refurbed cartridge, but not a brand new OEM one with fewer than 150 impressions.Driver install slightly more annoying than the M401n. Also had issue after first install where all of the installed printer devices had their drivers messed up, requiring manually deleting all of the currently installed drivers and manually reinstalling each device., my tUses a different toner cartridge than M401n. This was extremely annoying when HP does this, my toner supplies are segmented enough between model likes without them now doing between revision within the same model line (400 Pro). The redesigned cartridge is likely due to making the printer lower profile, but had it been the same as the M401n, I think the print issues would not have happened.", I bought 9 of these for new hires since the M401n was discontinued.

Color prints are clean and clear, but you won't find any laser printer that compares to a high-quality ink jet when it comes to printing photos."," Drivers and utilities from Lexmark seem redundant and confusing; it's hard to figure out what to download from Lexmark, and when to use what files and utilities. Also, the printer driver defaults to duplex printing; if you want single-sided printing, you have to change it in the driver."," The printer doesn't work so well on your network when you assign it a duplicate IP address as another device on the network. And that, folks, is 100% my fault, not the printer's. Explains why it took 8 hours to print the test page I sent it. Once I resolved that, everything is fine.",None,None

This was pretty easy to do after updating the firmware: one pass through all the settings, then saving them as an XML file to my computer. The only thing I have to do when I have guests is turn on Wireless Direct, they can handle the rest. There is an NFC ""module"" for this (the 1200W), but that's a little too esoteric."," There is one flaw in the newest firmware: if you lock down the settings from the web server, it disables menu access from the printer's control panel, but pressing the WiFi button seems to get you past this barrier, and someone in front of the device could change the Wireless Direct settings to allow open access to your network. As usual, when someone has physical access to a device, all bets are off, but this seems like a particularly careless mistake.Those adding RAM to their printers should take note that the 300/400 series user manual's diagrams are incorrect for this printer, you can't use SDRAM (two notches on a SODIMM stick), you must use a 144pin SODIMM (DDR2?) with one notch. Incidentally my 2605dn took SDRAM, so I thought I could move that stick to this printer."," I don't use CloudPrint much, but it's pretty handy, and Android has a printing plugin from HP for the times you're on the same network.EcoSMART is pretty good, and there's a handy meter showing you (relatively) how much power is used on standby with the current settings. Unlike older models, these newer HP printers tend to manage their power state themselves, which is good for those of us who forget to turn things off; I just wish there were even more aggressive choices.The print quality has been pretty good so far, clean and sharp. I won't be printing anything in continuous color like snapshots with this, but I figure that's the tradeoff: you can either have a machine that churns out hundreds of crisp duplex pages at once and can be off for weeks/months, or you can have gorgeous glossy 4x6 snapshots.",2,2

It sits about 5 feet from my bed and It's quiet enough that my wife can print while I'm asleep without waking me up.Does text very well and images are not bad either. I wouldn't use this to print out photos but for general use this thing does a fantastic job. Price per print when compared with ink is drastically lower.," The paper tray is of an odd design. The specs say it will hold 250 sheets but it takes a little coaxing to get them all in there.

So, if you have a 20 page, 2 sided document, and you want to scan it, you cannot do it with the ADF. When I asked Brother how I can do it, its response was ""You would have to manually flip the page to scan the other side of documents.""It appears to have the same limitation on copying from the ADF. If you insert paper and select Duplex Copy from the machine itself, the only options are 1 Sided -> 2 Sided; there is no option to copy 2 sided to 1 or 2 sided. In other words, if you have a 20 page, two sided document, you cannot copy it by putting it into the ADF, unless you copy one side, take it out, flip all 20 pages over, copy them, then stick all the pages back together.Brother never actually says this in its promotional material for this device.

Because a full set of four HP cartridges can cost more than this printer does, I suggest making sure that no firmware more recent than 20150716 be installed.  The 20150716 version may not remain available on the HP site much longer.

I bought it to replace my WONDERFUL Epson CX11NF which, unfortunately, is not made any more.  I could never get the color adjusted properly on the CLP – 775ND, even with the Samsung technician coming three times.  The two-sided printing didn't fuse well, so I would get residue on the 2nd side--even on matt paper. Forget glossy paper. Smeary all the time.  Samsung sent out their expert team after almost one year and replaced the machine.  The new one was worse than the first one!  Not only was the color worse, but the printer would stop printing and I'd get a paper jam prompt. The paper was NEVER jammed. I'd still have to open the tray, close it and THEN open and close the auxiliary paper tray, in order to reboot the machine and get it to start printing again.  And then it would happen again.  Never a reason.  I still had the double-sided printing issue.Samsung sent out their tech ""on a one time basis only.""  A very nice man (same as before) who tried his best to fix the problems.  No luck.  Samsung said I'd have to use the AIG extended warranty I got from Newegg for further repairs. It took forever to get a AIG repair person out.  Also a VERY nice man who certainly knows his stuff, but was unable to get the printer to work properly after 3 visits.  I am finally getting a refund for part of what I paid originally---but no refund for all the toner I had to buy at approximately $120-$130 per cartridge so I could continue wasting it and paper on substandard copies.It is very difficult to get ahold of anyone in the Samsung Corporate offices to help expedite a problem like this.  And I wouldn't wish my experience on my almost worst friend.Now I am having a heck of a time finding a printer that most reviews are happy with.  Seems no one is making them any longer.

Go to your computer (which is connected to the same network) and access the printer using the IP address the printer printed.

The setup (going through the wizards) took just a few minutes.  I connected this printer into a wireless router via an Ethernet cable.  The drivers on the computer picked up the printer by the IP address, and I was printing within minutes.HOWEVER; this being a workgroup grade printer needs to have the ability to configure a static IP address easily.  I looked over the documentation and the configuration software and found nothing relating to setting a static IP.  Maybe there is an ability to set the IP address manually, but Lexmark don't document it or make it easy.  Maybe I missed it, but I am pretty sure that I didn't.Most (higher end) printers make it easy to assign the IP address right on the printer's built in display.  This printer doesn't have a display, just some LED indicators, but there still should be an easy way to configure a static IP address.The only way I could figure out how to give this thing a static IP is by assigning a DHCP scope of 1 address to a VLAN, and assigning a single network port to that VLAN.  That's kind of a big oversight for a supposed network printer in my book.  If the Manufacturer wants to address that issue here that would be great.  If you do, please don't tell me to call your support # (I won't), just post the solution to the problem here.",,1,2

The colors are rich, vibrant and pop out at you."," The problems are several. First, after about seven months of use I was getting constant clogs on the printhead even after running the clean cycle. Since it was under warranty, I called Xerox support. The tech came out and agreed with me that the print quality was not up the standard and he wound up replacing the printhead with a new one (I also got a set of starter ink blocks out of this). The replacement printhead was warranty for six months. When I encounter the same issue just after the warranty, Xerox apologized and said that it would probably cost me $1000 for the technician to come out re-diagnose the problem and replace the printhead. At that point I told Xerox is cheaper to buy a new printer! And the person on support reluctantly agreed with me.Which brings us to the second issue, as has been mentioned in other reviews this printer (especially if you're using enhanced print) goes through ink like grass through a goose.I paid about $650 for the printer, to buy Xerox Inc. would cost me somewhere between $425 and $450. Once again we encounter the issue as to whether or not it's cheaper just to buy a new printer rather than filling it with ink. This in part can be alleviated by buying non-Xerox ink blocks (which is an interesting story unto itself). Since the printer is out of warranty using a brand other than Xerox won't invalidate it.The third issue, his envelopes. This printer has a very hard time understanding envelope size. And if you want to test print to see where the text and graphics for an envelope will fall, the printer is smart/dumb enough to insist that you put the appropriate sized paper in the tray. You can't just print on an 8.5 X 11 piece of paper and see how the layout fits. The printer sensors insist that you use the correct width paper. This can chew up a lot of envelopes very quickly.This printer replaced a standard Xerox powder toner printer and the results are noticeably better. But if I had known in advance the problems that I would encounter I sincerely believe I would've sought a different model."," Gorgeous color, but some days it feels like I'm having an arm wrestling match trying to get the printer to do what I wanted to.",None,None

But when it runs out of memory, you're done, and let's just hope you're not printing under deadline. As I type this, I'm printing a 72-page PDF, less than 200Mb, not graphics intensive. It got through about a third of the way through, humming along at about a page every 2 seconds or so. But then, as usual, things just ground to a halt, and now it's spitting out one page every 23 seconds. Rebooting helps briefly, but the only thing that truly helps -- for a while, anyway-- is shutting it off and leaving it alone for a day or two. From a cold boot, it can get through about 800 pages (multiple jobs) before it hits the lags. It's enraging, particularly when you just need to get something printed before a deadline. It's easily the nicest, glossiest color printer I've ever used, but its total inability to handle large-capacity jobs is indefensible. Just today I had a 400+-page doc that I needed to have printed; knowing that the ColorQube couldn't handle it, I just went ahead and sent it to a local printshop.

I paid a computer tech guy to come over and try to get this Xerox 3320dni printer to work.  He spent about an hour and tried everything-- new cords, changed the port on my computer from a usb 3.0 port to a usb 2.0.  Finally, he checked on-line and saw that the firmware had been updated.  He downloaded the new firmware and the printer is now working OK.  The bypass tray is also now automatic (thanks to an adjustment made by the computer tech).  I haven't used this printer much yet.  We'll see how it goes in the future.  I'm relieved that this printer is now working.", The con that I have is that I spent  $340 + shipping + $80 (service tech) on this printer and it came without the proper firmware.

The longer-term one had the ADF roller stop pulling paper at less than 10k pages and has had the receive-faxes-to-FTP hang up on a fax several times. You can still scan to the same ""shortcut"" defined in the printer, it just won't FTP faxes to it until the first one is cleared out. I've seen the same happen on the newer unit (~3 months old) to the extent that we simply rerouted incoming faxes through a VoIP system and receive incoming faxes there instead. Also on the newer unit, I'm about to head to that location with an emergency replacement printer, because apparently the fuser has failed in that 3-month-old unit.I suspect the FTP issue for faxes is something in their firmware hitting some bit pattern in TIF conversion of the received fax - there doesn't seem to be anything odd in the network traffic, though I did offer a WireShark log to Lexmark support (complete silence in reply)."," After a bit of experience, it seems the simplest way to clear the stuck fax issue is to get into the web interface and change fax handling to ""Print and forward,"" power it down, unplug the network, power it up with the network disconnected, and let it print all of the faxes while complaining about being unable to FTP.If you have one of these, I'm very sorry.

We have 6 of these printers, and they're all doing the exact same thing.The printer hangs every few days blinking ""busy"" on the screen, requiring reboots. The fax erroneously says ""line detected in wrong jack"", then quietly fails to receive incoming faxes. The printer jams and doesn't seem to feed the paper in. The printer can't detect legal vs letter paper and just quietly discards print jobs if you mismatch the two.Trying to deploy the printer via Windows Server Group Policies is a pain, too. The postscript driver defaults to duplex doublesided printing. The PCL driver is a User Mode 4 driver which cannot be deployed automatically.The Universal driver works, but Lexmark Support things that it is what is causing the ""green light flashing busy"" problems.All in all, I'm thoroughly disappointed, and the hours and hours of time we've lost in productivity and troubleshooting is staggaring.

I wanted to get an inexpensive printer that has all the options I have with these 2 printers so I picked this one (against my better judgement of HP printers). It has to be WiFi enabled so I can put it anywhere near a power outlet. My wireless network has 1 access point and 1 wireless router. I have a WDS system (Wireless Distribution System) in place and all the SSIDs for the access points are the same. This allows for seamless transition from different areas of the house without having to reenter passwords. This printer will not connect to my network unless I disable one of the access points. Once I do this and let the printer connect, I then re-enable the access point and it works...somewhat. It still does not print from HP ePrint, even with DMZ or port forwarding to the printer. This is unacceptable since all of my other wifi enabled devices and even the older wifi printer can connect to my network anywhere in the house with no issues. I tried updating the firmware, thinking this was an issue and has been resolved. I was wrong. Unless you have a simple wireless network, access to a local ethernet port, or plan to tether this to a computer with USB, then this printer will not work on a WDS, one SSID network.",0,5

The Canon is an ink jet and scanner and gives me much more colorful pictures than this Brother laser printer does and it gets sometimes as much as 5 pages per ink cartridge refill.  the Epson is ink jet also but with no scanner.  It also prints many more colors than the Brother and it is really easy to know when it is printing and when it is finished because as the print head sweeps back and forth, it shakes the entire table and I can hear it banging throughout the house.    The Brother makes no noise so it requires you to look at it to see if it has printed.

9SIA0AJ2MX3855,28-142-467,2/21/2014 6:54:40 PM,David L.,"Good printer, a bit slow",4, This isn't like the old laser printers where the printer needs to warm up before it is ready to print. From energy saving standby mode to output of the first page is well under 10 seconds. Print quality is good and it does everything you want from a multi-function printer," I've only used the printer via wireless. The scanning utility is a bit unreliable. Sometimes I'll use the auto document feeder or the plate glass, and about 5% of the time, it has some sort of scanning error. I can't figure out why.The interface is really clunky. I have the printer in another room. If I need to scan a document there are 2 ways. Place document, set it to remote scan, go to computer and initiate scan. If you have multiple pages, then you need to put the next page in and then scan the next page from the computer. If you are initiating the scan from the printer, you can pick the computer and it will start scanning. However, without being at your computer, you won't know that the page has finished processing and can only begin scanning the next page after that fact. Again, not an issue if the printer is right next to the computer.Obviously you could use the auto document feeder, but it has a lot of trouble, especially with mailed documents that have been folded in thirds. Even straightening the paper out as best as you can, the printer struggles.Another big con is the slow scanning speed over wireless. Even though you hear the scanning only taking a few seconds, it takes well over 1 minute before it is fully processed. Over the wireless network, even at 54mpbs, it still takes over a minute? Why?"," Wireless option is great if the computer is in close proximity to the printer, if it isn't it can be quite annoying to utilize the scanning function. Other than that, it is fast, and quiet. If you're looking for laser MF printer, it does the job.",1,1

After purchasing $600 of printer cartridges I discovered via an internet search that the machine has bad toner sensors.  Put a piece of tape over the sensors and the thing will print all day long.," The machine shuts down and will not print without replacing the printer cartridges due to faulty sensors.  You cannot remove and replace the sensors, shake the tray, reinsert and expect to continue.  This thing shuts down cold even though there is no deterioration in print quality.  After placing tape over the sensor the existing cartridge which the machine had previous shut down with telling me I was out of toner has printed flawlessly for the last 3 month. This is the cartridge that was going in the garbage can because the machine told me it was out.  I suggest you put duck tape over the sensor before you replace a cartridge at great expense and waste.  You'll know when to replace the cartridge when the print quality suffers."," I would love to hear from Brother.  I can provide receipts for the toner cartridges I have purchase (more than the cost of the machine in a very short time period with very light usage) and counter tallies which show light use.  I am one man office, I don't do that much paper work but I though the cost of a good quality machine would justify itself in per sheet cost over time, boy was I wrong.  I did not count on a machine that shuts a cartridge down after a few hundred prints as opposed to the few thousand prints specified on the side of the box.  And no there's no extraordinary printing here this is office correspondence and contracts mostly boring black and white stuff.",2,3

Print very little color so our inkjet printheads would always gum up and dry out, hoping the color toners will last longer.  I also love the linux support as all our servers are OpenSuse and setup with Brother units on print servers is a breeze.  Was amazed at the scan speed for a unit at this price point.  Haven't tested with a stopwatch but it appears to scan faster than advertised.  Wireless was a luxury so we opted out this time, but there are comparable models with it.

After setting the machine up, the first few print jobs were great. I was really impressed with this machine. It is now 6 days later and I can't wait to get it out of my house.

9SIA1N82KX3966,28-116-133,4/2/2016 12:29:31 PM,Patrick T.,This printer is a winner!,5," Bought this a couple months ago to replace an old Dell color, and an HP mono.  After much research, this appeared to present the best combination of price, consumable cost, print quality, and cost per page.  So far it has proven all of this.Printing is slow with the PS driver.  Very slow.  For our general office needs, PCL6 and 5 are just fine in output quality and speed—after a 10 second or so warmup pages output at near the specified rate.  Consumption of toner is light, and the printer ships with filled standard capacity cartridges.  We are at nearly 1800 pages and the black capacity indicator is only down one bar.  Well rated third party High Yield cartridges are available at about a quarter of the price of OEM.Output quality on PCL6 is sharp and clean.  Graphics and photos display nicely—there is no difference seen in text between that driver and the PS.  Photographs and detailed graphics have a bit of extra punch on PS, but for general office and handout use the PCL solutions are more than satisfactory.  Paper feeds clean with no jams or issues, and we did not experience the ‘envelope’ issue cited in another review.Output tray is smashing!  Unlike many printers now that essentially spew the paper to a flat top—this one is recessed and happily holds over 300 pages without scattering.  Top controls are adequate, and the display gives one all the info they need.  It’s a printer, not a space shuttle.  The paper tray holds 500+ sheets, and picks up flawlessly at all levels."," The driver interface leaves a bit to be desired for color adjustment.  We turn off the auto and let the application handle the balance.  Inserting materials into the bypass feeder does not automatically select that tray—one needs to manually select the bypass otherwise it picks up from the main tray.Plastic on the exterior side shells is a bit thin—but adequate.  The bypass tray door is a bit flimsier than I would like—but I don’t plan to sit on it.  Ambient and printing noise is a bit louder than some printers, but is certainly quieter than either of the laser printers it replaces in my office.    From sending the job to print takes 10 seconds of warmup on PCL.  Not a big deal when you really think about it.  Print time on PS is excruciating.  "," It’s very difficult to find a small office/workgroup printer that has a low cost of consumables (even third party), very high quality text and color output, and a lack of well documented maintenance issues across time.  This printer delivers on all of that and is a little workhorse.  I recommend it, and would buy another if the need arose.",None,None

It warms up quickly and prints very fast.  The print quality is great and the duplexing works quickly as well.  Connecting the printer to home network is also straightforward and easy.  However, for wireless networking a separate wireless accessories is required.  The printer ships with fully loaded toner cartridges, and I have yet to replace any of them after more than six months of moderate home use. The black toner cartridge is rated for 3000 pages and the color ones for 2000 pages.  Higher capacity cartridges are available as well.  there'll also several upgrade options available for the printer.

""It's normal for it to crumple envelopes""...,",1," Nice visually appealing output quality, fast printing", It likes to eat your envelopes (although customer service says thats normal for the unit)," Even though I purchased this at Costco I felt obligated to post a review to prevent anyone from making the same mistake I did in purchasing this unit.  I really REALLY wanted this unit to work because of the high quality output and what appears to be a very functional design in features. I have had the unit one day and it goes back now. The design is simple, and the display technology is dated, no biggie there though. Output is very nice and color looks great for the little I used it for when it is on standard paper. The deal breaker however is that the unit is so violent it destroys envelopes going through it. It pleats the envelope oddly on the trailing edge as if someone smashed the edge of the envelope into a desk repeatedly and the heat causes bad warping at the adhesive.  I never had this problem with my Oki color laser this was to replace.  The problem was repeatable with a high degree of accuracy with each envelope, trashing one after the next in exactly the same fashion. I called customer service for Xerox, they said, no problem, we will send someone to your place to fix it, its not supposed to do that. Two hours later a message appears from the follow up team saying that ""we are aware of this issue, nothing really can be done"" and that ""its normal"" that the envelopes are crumbling. Thanks to the quality vendors out there for being so easy to work with when the manufacturers can't get out of their own way. I would not consider this if you have any need to print envelopes at all.

As others have pointed out, setting up the network communications is a challenge. Initially we set up the printer using USB.  This worked fine with practically no setup required. But apparently the scanner must use Ethernet.  Got the scanner working on Ethernet, but then the printer (on USB) would not work. The Lexmark documentation really is not clear about what is and is not possible. Maybe they want you to get a service contract. Eventually we got it set up using Ethernet for both the printer and scanner and it works fine. Other reviewers have pointed out the difficulty of getting it set up on a network. We purchased Nuance Power PDF to use with the scanner with some concern that the program would not work with this scanner. It works well.

The email (SMTP) client supports SSL and thus works with all big email providers (gmail, office365 etc.) Once you setup email shortcuts, it takes 3 clicks to scan to email. Unlike the cx310, the cx410 series does have a duplex scanner, so you just load your 2 sided printouts on top and click go.Printing: Very, very good quality almost approaching that of an inkjet for photos, especially if you set the color handling to manual and decrease yellow, increase cyan to get a good neutral tone. Text and graphics are tack sharp. Takes up to 47lbs paper for duplex and up to 58lbs paper for simplex.Fax: just works. Supports both fax servers and analog fax. Can receive faxes and route them to email if desired.Consumables: the official Lexmark consumables are very close in price to (and may even be cheaper than) the 3rd party ones if you subscribe to the rewards program."," Setup is very tedious. You have to understand networking inside and out to set this up properly.SSL: the printer does not come with a list of certificate authorities (such as VeriSign etc.) that it trust right out of the box. To quickly enable email via SSL you have to disable cert checks. Disabling cert checks can only be done via the Web UI. You cannot do it from the printer itself.Duplex: duplex is a global setting. You cannot disable duplex for heavy paper for example, so if you try to print on thick and heavy paper you have to remember to switch it to simplex on your computer every time.Memory expansion: the slot is a standard DDR3 SO-DIMM slot.  However the printer is very picky about memory and I haven't been very successful upgrading it except via using the ""official kit""", Overall I'm very happy with it. Well worth the initial tedious setup.  You cannot easily beat the price/performance ratio of this MPL printer.,2,3

First, after the first set of ""gimped"" toner, I get about a 40% savings in toner cost.  The second is speed, this printer is literally 8X faster than the HP per page in color.  The third is quality, although a hair less sharp than the HP the quality is awesome (you have to look under a loop to see the difference though) the colors come through with greater depth than the HPs.  My HP gave up the ghost after only 10K pages, so we'll see how the OKI does over the next few months.  All in all, for the same price as the HP that died, this beats the HP hands down."," Downsides are that although network install was really easy, the instructions were not super clear.  Also too many driver choices make installation unclear, use the PS driver for graphics.  Also, the drums require a few pages of ""break in"", so your first few prints won't be perfect.  I assume that this happens every time you change drums.  Also, OKI has limited customizations for paper choices, unlike the HP, which has a lot of paper options that calculate temperature, page thickness and saturation all on a micro level.

9SIA4P01ZS5238,28-107-682,12/2/2013 7:35:32 PM,Jonathan F.,Good Printer,5," This is a solid printer, with good-quality, heavy-duty plastic. A big complaint of mine is that the lower-end printers tend to use thin plastics.  It also comes with good software.  Unlike HP's driver software, it doesn't install a huge amount of garbage onto your PC, either.I have to compare this to the three business-class HP inkjets that I am familiar with, the 7500, 8500, and 8600.  This beats them hands down.  HP claims a lower cost per page than lasers, but I am not convinced.  The inkjets are constantly cleaning themselves, wasting vast quantities of ink in the process.  Additionally, if they are not regularly used, the inks start to dry out, so the printers cycle ink through the nozzles - wasting more ink.  Lasers do not have this issue.  Also, the 3,500 page toner cartridge for this does not cost 3.5x as much as the 1,000 page ink cartridge for the inkjets. This printer takes much less time to start up from a power-on than the HP toy printers.  Really, comparing what HP calls ""business class"" to this is something of a joke - the HP's come off looking chintzy and ""toy""-ish.  HP makes some very solid, very good business printers, but not in this price range.The print quality is good.  It's not going to win awards for photo printing, but that is not why people buy color lasers.  It will do a good job with business-class printing, though.One note on the toner: the toner that ships with the unit is glossy, not matte.  If you don't like glossy toner, you might not like how this looks.  Also, if you need to be able to write on the print, glossy toner doesn't work as well as matte.  These items don't bother me, but they drive my wife nuts.  However, she found a work-around: the printer comes with 3 toner-saving modes.  She sets the printer to the ""High"" level, and then it doesn't look so glossy, and she can write on the printout.  This may not be an issue for you, but just be forewarned - the toner is glossy, not matte."," Not necessarily a con, but, as noted in the pros, the toner is glossy.",,1,1

Bought a refurb one from Newegg dirt cheap after rebate and promo code. Memory was a breeze to add. I connected it to my printserver easily via USB and used the parallel connection (simultaneously) to connect to an older W98 machine I use to run several legacy programs that XP won't support. Two other computers use XP, and I also have a laptop running Win 7. Win 7 was a little difficult to set up, but I think it was more a function of Win 7 (I couldn't use homegroup because the other machines had different OSs). The HL-5240 appears to be a faster version of the HL-1440 with more memory and better resolution, and the interface is almost identical. I own the HL-1440 and have been pleased with it, so I decided to upgrade. I will note, however, that I am a light user."," Uses older laptop memory, not quite as easy/cheap to find as newer DDR versions, but at least it's not proprietary. Manual duplex took a while to figure out. The HL-1440 manual duplex was straightforward, so it took me a while to figure out that on the HL-5240 I had to do things a little differently, even though the interfaces are practically identical.  After selecting the manual duplex mode, I had to select ""Tray1"" for the First Page under the Paper Source, and not let it default to ""Auto Select"", otherwise it wants to print the second side from the MP Tray, which doesn't hold much paper.  Other than this little quirk and the Win 7 setup, everything was easy and straightforward. Oh, shipping took almost a week, which is very unusual for Newegg."," The refurb looked brand new.  You'll need to read the manual to figure out how to print out the status page which shows you if your memory has been added correctly and how much predicted life you have left in the toner and drum. Don't buy the expensive memory recommended in the manual.  Buy the cheapest 144-pin sodimm SDRAM you can find, just make sure you buy from a reputable vendor, that it isn't registered, and that it's LOW density. I bought PC133, 3.3v, CL3 (CAS latency of 3, not the 2 they say you have to have) and it worked great. If the memory is faster than the recommended PC100, then you can use a higher latency (within reason). The memory they recommend costs 4x more than what I paid (for 512mb).  In all, the refurb printer with additional 512mb memory cost me less than a Franklin (assuming I get the rebate).",2,2

First, they don't tell you that you're not covered unless you go out of your way to find their so-called policy form.  Since you paid for it, wouldn't they just send it to you if they were not crooks?  Well, like the 10% of sheeple who actually followed through, I navigated unlisted websites and created accounts to get my ""policy"" form.  Guess what, they conveniently made a typo, actually a couple of typos.  Then I read their terms which say something like ""Policy void if the original paper receipt does not exactly match the Policy"".  Their ideas are almost reasonable in theory, but the way they implement it make their business model a gold mine.  Oh, if there is any ""dispute"" they get to decide to end the ""agreement"", which means you get your premium back! No interest, no penalty, no deal.

In my case I print very rarely, so an inkjet is inconvenient, since it dries up if not used very often.  For the odd picture I may want to print I can head to the store and have it printed for 30 cents.  That being said, I was blown away by the quality of prints from a laser at this price.  I got it on sale for under $300 and didn't expect the print quality of a $2000 laser.     If you have a high quality high resolution photo the output can be quite good and framable.  I'm talking a photo from a digital SLR camera with a good lense.  And that's on plain paper.  Remanufactured cartridges are common for this model so the print cost is very reasonable.  There is a built in web server on the printer so installing drivers is easy as they are stored on board the printer.  I used the ethernet connection and it works great.  There is no duplexer but one is available on an upgraded model so that doesn't bother me.  I love that it has a paper tray compared to an inkjet so your paper is stored and stays straight and good.  With an inkjet your paper is exposed to the elements and everytime you go for a sheet of paper it's curled.  I wish this printer had a 500 sheet capacity so a ream would fit, but no other printer offers that option either so it's no big loss.  Honestly, if you don't need the 100% print quality of an inkjet, I would not recommend an inkjet printer.  I would settle for a laser that has 80% the photo quality of an inkjet, but twice the quality when printing everything else.  You'll never need expensive coated photo papers again.  You won't have to clean your print heads every once in a while to improve print quality.  No more messing with ink and continuous ink systems trying to save money.  A laser should last a long time compared to an inkjet so the long term investment is economical.  Really, for 95% of the people who purchase inkjet printers, they should actually be purchasing a color laser printer, and I feel in this price range the HP 400 series is the best.      I found a high resolution 10MB or so photo of a tiger on the internet and tested it out on plain paper.  From a couple of feet away my family couldn't tell the difference between it and an inkjet.  But with low quality pictures you definitely notice.  For printing documents and web pages, office documents, .pdf's, etc... it's in a league of it's own that an inkjet can't compete in.  Compared to other sub $300 color laser, Samsung, Brother, Xerox, and other brands arn't as good when it comes to print quality and build quality.  Also support for remanufactured cartridges is great with the HP.  This printer gets the 2 thumbs up.",3,3

In the week or so that I have been using it I must say that it is performing well and living up to my expectations."," I my previous review I noted a problem that locked me out of the settings both on the front panel and the web interface.  I became extremely frustrated after spending a few hours on 2 different chats with 2 different engineers and was told my only option was to send the printer back.  Today I was about to contact NewEgg about a RMA but decide to try HP one more time.  This time the support engineer's first suggestion was to rest the NVRAM, basically what I had been begging for and was told it could not be done. In short he gave me the simple procedure and 3 minutes later I was back into the printer.  Everything is fine now. TIP: Even thought it does not mention it on the password page, DO NOT enter a password over 16 characters long or you will be locked out.  Also if the tech support rep appears to be useless, politely hang up and try again because there are some who actually know what they are doing."," In fairness to HP just like the tech support reps an my company, they are not engineers and are working from knowledge base articles.

I wrote it down and am 100% sure that I have the password I entered but now I am completely locked out of the printer setup.  I spent over an hour chatting with HP and apparently there is no way to factory reset and start again other than through the front panel menu.  One catch the front panel menu is disabled when security is enabled.  Only option, return to reseller.  So use for 20 minutes then ship it back...This is not acceptable.  I'm going to Google around for a bit but to me it seems ridiculous that there is no way to reset the device when you have physical access.  I already found one article where a teacher had one in his classroom and apparently a student entered a password, now he is locked out too. In the forum his only option was to send it back.This is crazy."," By profession I am an embedded systems designer with over 36 years experience.  We have and would never ship something that could not be at least ""reset"" in the field.  I mean people forget passwords all the time.  You should never be able to get past the password, but with physical access there should always be some way to factory reset the device.They tell me they will replace mine under warranty, but they are telling me that everyone who forgets their password in a year is going to have to pay...  This is more trouble for everyone.This experience has definitely put me off HP printers.  I have been using HP laser printers for decades, literally and had considered them the king of laser printers.  Other companies have some nice offerings, but I stuck with HP out of loyalty.  With this poor design, and the uselessness of the technical support, I think it is time to change.Sorry for the rant, but I am quite frustrated.",4,7

Amazingly simple.  This truly is a ""Plug & Play"" device. I don't get on well with complicated computer software and devices, and I was a bit skeptical when I ordered this unit, but I really was surprised at how easy it is to use. The unit arrived by UPS less than 48 hours after I placed the order, and that was with standard (free) shipping. The packaging was sturdy, but very easy to open and unpack. I would recommend this Samsung product to anyone who wants a simple home device for copying, scanning and faxing. I thought the price was great for everything this unit can do.

I had used HP laser jet series in the past and decided after some research, that HP still was my choice.  At first I bought a series 200 LaserJet and found that it just could not hold up to the demand for home and occasional business use.  I went to a nearby office supply store to allow me to ""look & play"" with the LaserJet 400 M451dn.  I decided to ""upgrade"" from the LaserJet 200 series to the LaserJet Pro 400 M451dn, so back to Newegg for the purchase.  Ever since I made the switch, the M451dn has performed flawlessly and never let me down, in grand HP style.  The color and black is sharp and even, no streaks or disappointments (even with long legal sized documents).  If I had it to do again, I'd buy this same printer.  Holds up well to home and small office applications and work loads.  It's easy on toner use too.  I always use HP toner - why take the chance?  It's not the cost of the printer as much as it's availability when you need it RIGHT NOW!!!!"," No Cons, for this printer, as far as I'm concerned."," Connectability is ideal, as it works with USB & ethernet.  I print from my MacPro, iPad, and iPhone all the time, whether I'm within WiFi range or not.  The double-sided print function also saves paper for those long documents.",2,2

The Oki had color matching issues and envelope handling problems that I couldn't solve.  This is a relatively new model of printer for HP, so there wasn't a track record, but I've always had pretty good luck with the higher end HP products.I needed this printer to print our company's letterhead, envelopes and business cards with acceptably high quality in the same color I see on the screen.  I'm very happy with the color matching I'm getting from the HP LJPro 400.  My Oki wrinkled the envelopes when I printed the return address on them; the HP handles this task flawlessly.  In fact one of our partners thought I was getting them printed by an offset printer.HP Eprint software comes with the printer, and I have used that successfully to print while out of town.  It's also compatible with Apple's IPad and IPhone, so my husband is able to print from his Apple devices.It comes with the small toner cartridges installed, so after printing ~800 sheets, I'm down to 60% capacity in the color cartridges and 40% capacity for the black cartridge.  I'll replace these as they used up with the larger capacity cartridges.  Since it's not my default printer, I'm hoping to get a year out of each cartridge.  So far I'm on track.  It will cost in the neighborhood of $400 to replace all four toners.",11,11

Can't remember if this version includes it or the last unit I had...sorry!  I know, I suck!*Brother Utilities are actually OK.  I use it without swearing or throwing things, so that's cool (see cons)."," Never been a fan of printer software suites, but this is fine (Not letting my bias affect the egg score).  Can't a company make a third party package that works with the drivers without giving me a bunch of stuff I don't use?  Who does anything but scan and print out the occasional page anymore?  Give me robust scan/OCR/profile/Document handling/saving features and throw the rest out.  These utilities never seem very lightweight.  Like I said though...decent.  Ain't losing even a half-egg over it. When installing drivers though, it sometimes produces two ""units"" as recognized by Windows (not WIA vs TWAIN...actually two devices).  I'm in IT, so I can handle it and fix it (that sounds so arrogant, but I want to relay that I have at least some tech knowledge).  At home I'm simply to lazy to really pay attention to what happens.  I would rather it not have issues detecting the drivers, and I wouldn't have to reinstall them.  This is probably just as much a Windows Error/Me being in a rush and I will refuse to deduct an egg.  Problem is easily remedied by re-configuring port addresses/driver package deletion within Windows device settings.  Stopping/restarting the print spooler service can be your friend on many of these tasks!  It only happened once with this model, and probably because I decided to set the Olympic standard for driver installation and printer setup.  Slow Down Mang!  Duplex scanning is SLOW!!!!!!!!! (single sided is fine...not terribly surprised by this but sucks none the less as this was the primary reason I settled for this model)It is a bit loud, nothing out of the norm.  Still not removing an egg."," *I haven't tested the fax capabilities of this unit (why are we still using 1960's tech?  I wish our company would dump it.  We can do it people...all at once...GO!)** Haven't tested the Wifi/moble printing.  No one else in my home prints really, and laptop users are already connected via my existing network/wifi, so they just install the drivers (only, no suite) and away they go.  Sometimes I keep things basic and simple even though ""new tech"" exists.  Maybe in my next life I'll have time to do stuff like that.  These crazy long reviews take time ya know. ***I'll take the c@cky liberty of addressing some concerns within these reviews.  If ur like me, that's how you do all your research:1)  Toner yield.  Starter cartridges are normally used on printers, and yield counts vary because no one, not even the almighty himself really knows how much ink/toner YOUR page needs.  Maybe all my printing consists of sonnets that are only a few lines.  Some people may print out monochrome cruise brochures to bring to their boggle tournaments.  So take those comments with a grain of salt.  Of course knowledge is power, so nothing against the reviewer personally.2)  Power.  Yes, when STARTING; laser printers use LOTS and LOTS of watts.  Once they're going though, power consumption is nothing too crazy.  If you're in need of limiting power that much, you are used to bringing out the kilo-watt, dimming the lights, using all platinum psu's and haswell energy efficient processors.  For most, you'll be fine.  Don't put printers on battery backups, surge protectors are usually your friend, and yes, you WILL need power for the roughly 5-20 second start-up process.Conclusion of sorts:****Got rid of my old ink jet.  I'd spend $100 on ink, use it conservatively, only to have it dry out due to the lack of use.  Technically my fault, but I was getting sick of being treated like trash even though my habits are probably normal, if not preferred.  If we need to print color, we just make a trip to W@lgree^s, or use some online service that can probably do it cheaper overall anyways.  Guess what?  In the year I've had this printer, never needed color...not once!  Who needs to print on paper anymore?  If you're hesitating; I would stop.  Give up the ink and go laser.  If you're some sort of family photo printing maven, you should stop reading this review immediately and get the best photo ink jet you can.  Shame on you for not knowing that!Overall I like this unit, and have enjoyed Brother units for years now.  They may not be the best; but I find for the value, ease of use, and reliability...I probably won't ever buy another brand.  Certainly NOT HP.  HP if ur reading this, send me some units to test (and keep) and maybe I'll change my mind.  Most printers in this category (if not all) have some major points of failure, so like most things in life; treat with care and you'll have a unit that lasts.  In hindsight, depending on sale prices, I may opt for the unit without duplex scanning and save myself some coin.  I can scan twice, merge in PDF software in little more time then the unit takes to duplex scan.  If you have LOTS of batch scanning that is all dual sided,  then this feature shouldn't  (for your sake) be skipped.Hope you enjoyed my review.  Stay tuned next week where I have a near death experience after trying to unplug molex connectors within a non-coated case.",3,3

Quality third party high capacity toner cartridges are available at reasonable prices, and I have used several brands over the years without incidence in 3 other Brother Laser printers that I've had. Brother printers hold up well and represent a very good value. Check out the price of consumables for a Samsung or Cannon MFC to get an idea.If you are interested in this MFC, then check around for a while as I have seen fluctuations of as much as $45 in a single day. As with the other Brother laser printers I have owned, they all have worked well and though the models I have bought may not have had the highest specs in their category, all have continued working for years without problems and consumables were a lot less than competitors.

It would take a lot of abuse to damage this thing in shipping.- Comes with a (short) USB cable where most printers these days do not.  Nice to have for initial setup of wifi.- Setup in Win7 64bit was a breeze! Just follow directions. My other Win7 PC found it on network easily later, too.- It works with WPA2 (WEP and WPS seem to work, too, but I like WPA2 better.)- If you change wifi settings, just plug it back in via USB.  Run the utility and enter new settings manually or let the printer auto-detect from your PC.- The document feeder on top works fine for copies - no jams or failures yet. (Copy from scanner bed works, too.)- ID copy feature lets you fill up a single page with incremental scans of smaller images, all from the printer - no PC software-based editing required.- The control panel can be tilted up - easier to see if below eye-level.- Even with wifi connect, I've had no issues with it not waking up from standby to print."," -Included USB cable is very short, something like 2 feet. If you plan to use this via a USB cable, be prepared for the back of the printer to be within 2 feet of the USB port on your PC. That could be tricky for some folks' computer desks. (You could buy a longer cable, I suppose, but that makes the total cost higher.)- There isn't really a ""paper tray"" at all. There's a fold down door at the bottom of the front. You lay it down and put the blank paper in there. It sits there, exposed to light and air and dust and dog hair. I will have to take the paper out and close the door if I don't plan to print for a while. The lack of a drawer-type tray that slides completely under the printer means it's not quite as easy to be an ""on demand printer"" at this house.- The normal toner cartridge (not the intro one it ships with) has something like a 1600 page yield and seems to be $50-$60. That seems on the expensive side of cost-per-page for laser printers. Consider if you do a lot of printing"," None of the cons above deserve a star knocked off, as they were obvious limitations before I decided to buy it.  The only surprises I got with this were pros, not cons.I didn't buy it from newegg (they didn't have it listed when I bought mine.)I'm using this with two Win7 64bit PCs and an Actiontec router which is supplied by Verizon FiOS.  Wireless printing works with the PCs wired or wireless to the router.For the price point, this thing has a lot of features.  I've thought of HP as making quality printer products for years.

After I replaced the toner, it continued this way, but the distortion became unacceptably worse. When investigating, I found the problem in the paper path. The paper is drawn through two rollers deep inside the printer body. The lower roller is very soft, made of a thinly covered spongy material, while the upper roller is covered with some plastic tubing. It was here, in the tubing, that the tube became split around its circumference, permanently ruining every piece of paper that that passed through it, whether duplex or single-side.

It was quick and easy to set up (except for a couple minor things, below), prints very well, and Rosewill makes refills for it that are super inexpensive and seemed to be good for a few thousand sheets or so (they rate it at 8000, but I think that's the max - realistically it's more like 4000 if the sheets have a lot of stuff on them).

Don't get me wrong, setting up the thing was super simple, but the additional functions after setup take a little getting used to. Scanning to your PC (after you've set up the software) is simple, but then you have to choose what you are scanning it as, and instead of simply choosing a file type (jpg, pdf, etc) you pick a less specific term (email, picture, etc) - so you have to get that figured out.

Makes really good sense.•	Web based management (you can do all your configuration through the web portal).•	Laser (not inkjet)• 	Been working like a workhorse for last month, through power outages, wifi drops etc.•	FAST! I can’t complain on the print speed or the scan speed. I ate through a thick assorted pile of documents (receipts, Legal, Letter, etc) within an hour. Highest quality color double sided scanning is slowest.•	Scan file size – reasonable – Most of my docs are coming in at 100KB with the b/w, color 2-3 page scans coming at 1MB. Compare this to some other scanners I have used that would regularly spit out 2-4MB files on average.•	Didn’t need no drivers (finally!).

Even not unpacked/repacked. Comes with both power and USB cables."," For wireless, you need to have a network router, or installed 3rd part free software like Virtual Router."," 1) I write this review mainly to correct the misconception that there is no way to see the number of printed pages. I am not sure how to do it via USB, but wirelessly you can see it in the “Remote UI”. If the printer appears in the ""Windows Explorer""/Network, then just double-click its icon. If not, enter the IP address of your printer in the address line of your web browser (the address looks like 192.168.1.XXX). Then Log In/Status Monitor/Check Counter. There will be the number of pages, which, I believe, is the total number for the whole life of the printer. If you don’t know the IP address, see it in “Devices and Printers”/right click on Canon LBP6030w icon/Printer Properties/Ports/Configure Port (this is if you use CNMFNP or Standard TCP/IP port), or “Devices and Printers”/right click on Canon LBP6030w icon/Properties/Web Services (if you use WSD port). Also, you can print out the “User Data List” – press and hold for several seconds the grey button (Paper indicator) on your printer.2) If you are printing only one page, you can print even without having to open trays. There should be no more than 20 sheets of paper in the input tray. Leave both input and output trays closed, and it will print just fine with closed trays.3) I bought two printers (in October 2015) and their retail boxes look pretty decent – the only thing is they have some old mailing stickers and some very minor tears/scratches/dents. Each of the boxes has two stickers with UPC codes in two different places, and in my case none of them is covered with other stickers.4) It can print if you cover the microchip’s contacts on the cartridge with the Scotch tape – no warnings or error messages pop up. That may mean that you can use other cartridges that fit physically – although Canon does not recommend it. Also, there is “Toner density” adjustment in the driver in Printing Preferences/Quality/Advanced Settings – so if your “other” cartridge happens to print too light, you can improve it by setting darker.5) To print without the external router, I tried to use the free software Virtual Router v1.0. First, it was a headache to make it work properly, and I almost gave up. But suddenly, after several tries and Windows restarts, it started to work perfectly.",1,1

Two more calls and and two more hours later finally reach a different agent that also knows of firmware update, this time actually receive the email. After two effectively DOA printers back to back and almost a full day of my life wasted troubleshooting these printers I politely asked HP to extend warranty on the printer because of obvious quality control issues.

N82E16828731005,28-731-005,8/7/2014 7:17:16 PM,Nathan R.,Great document printer for the price,5," There was quite a bit to like about this printer. I found setup to be quite easy. I didn't bother to read a thing. Instead I unpacked, removed the tape holding it together and  simply  attempted on my own to install the toner, paper and get it all connected and software installed. I was able to accomplish this all in less than 15 minutes without instruction at all. So that is saying a lot about the intuitiveness of the design. Nothing was a mystery.I like the black color of the printer. Too often you're stuck with the beige/gray type laser printers as your only choices. The physical dimensions of the printers were ideal also. To test this printer I installed into my  father in laws office as he does a lot of document printing. However space was limited and I was concerned that it might be a show stopper. Not the case. For a laser printer, it has a pretty reasonably size footprint and fit into the space with room to spare.We printed many batches of documents (maybe 3000-4000 sheets in total) for his business. Before this he had an ink-jet printer where printing that many documents would take him days. This was a major improvement in terms of speed, taking only a couple of hours to do all the work and have all the documents printed. Not only that, but the detail in the print was much greater. Most of his documents display bar codes on them, and these never looked as crisp as they did this time around. Factor in that this printer's cost is about what he normally spent on ink for his other printer and it's a wonder why anyone needing a good laser document printer wouldn't buy something like this.None of the documents he prints at any time needed more than a couple hundred sheets of paper, so the paper tray on this accommodated his needs just fine also.My personal laser printer costs 6 times the amount that the Pantum costs, and despite that, it does on annoying thing. The sheets of paper that come out of my much more expensive printer always end up curving or developing a slight roll. The Pantum could print in simplex or duplex and in either case the sheets of paper came out flat. This is quite desirable that the printer didn't adversely affect the condition of the paper negatively.A nice bonus was the included USB cable. It is also capable of being connected to a network via Ethernet.In all I have to say this thing held up  beautifully and performed consistently and with quality over a near two month time period."," Again, when you're happy with a product, it's hard to come up with a lot of negative things to say. So if some of this seems a little nit-picky or inconsiderate of the price, it maybe, but still should provoke some thought into discovering  what your needs might be.My first con is the some what annoying manner in how it prints. My Brother MFC, once it starts a document, will continue to printer each page/sheet of the document without pause or interruption. This printer would also take long pauses and seem hesitant at times middle way through a document. I'd often think while listening to it print that it was done, only for it to then start up again after a few seconds.The paper tray supports multiple sizes of paper. While it was quite clear how to adjust the tray to hold the size of paper I needed to print, the actual execution of it was slightly cumbersome. Given how often anyone may change paper size though may make this slight annoyance virtually unnoticeable and completely excusable.I was hoping that it would be a little faster at printing also. Maybe I'm expecting too much for the price, but the pauses between pages certainly  didn't help speed.I'd be happy if it included a WIFI connection. Charge a few bucks more and include that option and suddenly this device is so much more capable in terms of placement and convenience. It's just a printer and doesn't include any added functionality such as scanning, copying, faxing. Not really a con as it isn't marketed as such, but just something to consider."," I was pretty impressed by this little printer. It did a lot of things right and made me question why I spent $600 for a big Brother MFC Color Laser printer. I hardly ever do any printing whatsoever. My wife is a teach however and she prints often. 90% of the time she printers documents, usually monochrome. My Brother MFC is faster at printing, I will say that. But it's a giant machine that requires a special stand of it's own just to host it's presence, it creates roll or curvature in the paper as it prints also, and it costs a fortune by comparison to this printer. Granted, it has WIFI as well as Ethernet and USB. It can do scanning and copying. It can print in color. But most of the time I don't need any of that.So my point is if you know your needs, you'd be a fool not to grab this machine. For the cost and quality of product, it's a no-brainer.I'm not a huge printer guru, I will admit. I hadn't ever heard of the brand Pantum prior actually and was skeptical of what new name low quality junk I'd be testing here. I have to say that never really became the case. It held up for 2 months and is still going strong now even. I'd love to be able to post back in a year and let everyone know what my thoughts on Pantum are. But for now I'll just have to go off of the longest time I could muster before Newegg started complaining that I was taking too long to post my review. Initial indications point to a good product from a good company.So to wrap up, if you need to print quality documents in a reasonable amount of time at a low cost, you'd be a fool not to buy this printer. If there's competition out there, I don't know about it. The Pantum P3255DN has run the gamut and passed with flying colors.",2,3
N82E16828731005,28-731-005,7/27/2014 9:15:41 AM,Michael R.,A VERY FORMIDABLE NEW ENTRY INTO THE SOHO LASER PRINTER MARKET,5," Faster Processor and more Memory than any of it’s competitors. We’re talking a 300 Mhz processor and 128 Mb of ram, as compared to most competitors 200Mhz and 32-64Mb of ram. The built in Duplex printing  works extremely well by the way. It is USB 2.0 or Ethernet capable, and yes it DOES include a USB 2.0 cable unlike most competitors models.Very nice matte black finish and a footprint in line with other competitive makes, and smaller than most good quality Inkjet printers. Well placed on/off switch, and two LED’s on the top that monitor cartridge status, printer status, and paper status.Paper tray holds a full 250 sheet load of 20# paper, and output tray on top will hold just shy of 150 sheets. Printer is very quick to print, coming out of standby in less than six seconds, and goes into standby most for less power consumption in less than one minute. Able to handle a wide variety of print media including card stock and transparencies with ease. Will operate on most current Windows Server software and XP,Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8 operating systems. It is not at this time MAC Os compatible.Print cartridge included with the printer is a full 3000 sheet cartridge, unlike most than only give you a starter cartridge. Optional 6000 sheet high capacity cartridge is competitively priced, but only available as new at the moment.Built in print server interface using the printer’s IP address as found by the installation software is basic and will work well for most users. Using the updated software downloaded from the web site I had no issue putting in or removing personal data.Cost of replacement print cartridges (new only at this time) is reasonable for the standard and high capacity cartridges.Pantum Customer Service does care about it’s products and it’s users and is very responsive to their needs ( see other thoughts)."," Installation software on the included CD-Rom disc is not the latest available, nor does it include an automatic update feature to update it. For this reason, I recommend that anyone purchasing the Pantum P3255DN download the current driver and the current manual in PDF format from the Pantum website.  The driver installation file downloaded from the web site, being much newer, gives a better interface and better address recognition if you install the printer over a wired Ethernet interface instead of USB 2.0.Pantum’s web site, though easy to navigate, has very slow download times.  They need to look into a remedy for this.  A new user usually doesn’t like to take a half hour or more to download the newest driver and manual.  They have improved the site somewhat recently, and the PDF files for the manual does download in the correct language.It would be nice at this price point to have either a digital screen for printer functions instead of the LED’s, or to have WI/FI capability. Some printers in this price range do have this, though the Pantum has them beat in processor speed and ram, which allows the Pantum to print faster and store more print data.  Kind of a trade off there.Pantum needs to provide a provision in the installation software for installing the printer using a NetBios name as some offices have to have that. Built in driver software updating might be good too. I had no issues installing the printer by Cat6E Ethernet cable and assigning it an IP address using the updated software, nor did I have an issue using it with a 500Mbps Homeplug setup. I used the same address for both and it printed well either way.  In it’s final installation it will remain hardwired by CAT6E cable to my switch with an assigned IP.  NO aftermarket standard or high capacity cartridges are available as yet for this printer. Hopefully, within a year or so as the company gets more well known, the cartridges will become available from third party providers and the cost will go down."," This is a very nice printer and a good piece of SOHO hardware. I had been looking for a small laser printer to add to my office to go along with my Brother All-in-One inkjet. Pantum does need to work some with their software and putting a few more options in it, but overall they have put out a pretty good product in the P3255DN printer. I would like to see them add WiFi capability to the printer though to put it on par with some of the Brother and HP units in this price range.I did have a need to contact Pantum Customer Support when I received the initial printer and cartridge shipment from NewEgg.  Through a series of phone calls and text messages with NewEgg and Pantum, we were able to get the issue worked out and I was happy to start putting the P3255DN through it’s paces and see what it could do. If not for the few quibbles with the installation software needing to be a little more complete, I could give this printer a well deserved Five Egg rating. But since I can’t give half eggs, and four eggs doesn’t seem fair, I’ll go ahead and give it a Five Egg rating. I trust that Pantum, once they get more input from the consumer, will work out the few little quirks needed in their installation software.As a NewEgg EggXpert reviewer, I am neither paid by NewEgg nor Pantum to review their products. I am simply provided with a product to review and given the opportunity to work with the product and sound off on my experience with the product.",1,1
N82E16828731005,28-731-005,7/2/2014 9:22:50 AM,Nathan E.,"Great Hardware, Terrible Software",3," I really like this printer.  It includes both the ability to network the printer and the ability to connect it directly to your PC via USB with the included cable.  It is a matte black finish and is a little larger than the Brother counterparts I normally recommend to my clients.  The printer doesn’t have an LCD screen, but does have a web based interface.  The interface is very basic and buggy (See cons).I’m guessing the printer holds about 200 sheets of paper, which is a decent amount.  There are two LEDs on the top of the printer that provide Status information and one button, labeled Continue.  The LEDs flash different colors and patterns based on errors, status, etc.  You'll need to refer to the Users' Manual for specifics.  The power button is a toggle switch on the side of the printer.  The printer defaults to standby mode after 1 minute, but that can be changed through the web interface.  The printer comes with an included CD that is supposed to scan your network, find the printer and then complete the installation, although it really didn’t work that way.  I had some issues getting it installed and if I were a typical user, I would have been easily frustrated (See cons).  The test system is running Windows 7 Ultimate x64.  The printer is fast and comes out of standby and finishes printing the first page in under 11 seconds.  When already awake, you get the first page in about 5 seconds.   The text looks crisp and it even did a good job printing out some gray scale pictures.  I printed about 150 pages while testing, and didn't have any issues or jams.  Not bad for a sub $120 price point."," Unfortunately, this is going to be the long section.  The setup is backwards and pretty stupid if you ask me.   Out of the box the printer is set to use DHCP, which is fine by me.  The problem is that the installation routine installs the printer by IP address as opposed to using NetBIOS name.  That means as soon as your DHCP server decides to hand the printer a new address, bye, bye printer.  You’ll have to go through the setup process all over again.  I find that absolutely insane.  If you aren’t a tech oriented person, you would end up with a printer that worked for a few days and then suddenly didn’t.  I find this to be a terrible oversight by Pantum.  I ended up setting a static IP in my router outside of the normal addressable range, and installing the printer that way.   Now I don’t have to worry about the printer disappearing.  The installation routine has an issue finding the printer depending on how it is wired.  Initially, the program found the printer when it was directly attached to my main switch.  As soon as I moved it into its final location and connected it to a secondary switch, the program no longer found the printer.  If I didn’t know how to check the DHCP server’s connection list and find the assigned IP address, I would have been unable to continue.  The web interface for the printer can be found by entering the IP address of the printer into your favorite web browser.  It provides very basic functionality, which is fine by me, but it does have some bugs.  They included email alerts for things like “out of paper”, or “out of ink”, but the software doesn’t handle SSL which makes it almost worthless.  I don’t have any accounts that don’t use SSL, so I was stuck.  One other problem is that once you enter your email address and try and test the setup, you can’t delete or remove the information.  The software gets stuck in a loop where it keeps telling you that the fields are required information and it can’t be deleted.  So I had to leave my email address, port number, server address(es) and password in the form with no way to remove them.  Oops.Pantum’s issues seem to be solely surrounding their software and not the hardware.  I tried downloading the newest drivers off their website, but I think their site is hosted in someones’ basement, because it is slow to the point of almost being unusable.   Good luck downloading the manual.  Go to the US Pantum website and the only available manual gives the language as Spanish, which I didn’t notice and downloaded anyway.

This will put the printer into a special service mode. Use the + and - buttons to scroll to whichever toner you want to reset. Each color should have three options which, I believe, allow you to tell the machine what type of 'new' toner cartridge is installed. Once you've selected the cartridge you want to tell it you're installing hit the ""OK"" button and will get an ""OK reset cancel"" type screen. Hit the up arrow to reset.

9SIA9JJ4NW3654,28-113-833,5/4/2014 10:42:10 AM,JASON J.,So far so good...,5," I've been using this for a few days now and have printed both text and images. Overall it was fairly simple to set up via USB, and the print quality I would say is decently good in this price range...with photos of comparable quality to  high-end ink-jet. Whereas text is always very sharp and well-defined.  The unit appears to be very well built and reliable...it doesn't have a ""cheap plastic"" feel to it at all. And neither does it paper-jam which is very refreshing...making it a joy to use. And while on the subject, filling the actual paper tray on the bottom is very convenient to do, especially since it holds up to a robust 250 pages. Basically, it's a unit that can just be plugged in, set up in 10-15 mins tops, and you are soon on your way with print jobs that are reasonably fast. The first page takes a bit longer to print btw, but successive pages come out faster...with only a moderate non-annoying noise-level while actually printing.  Easy removal and replacement of the cartridges is a nice feature indeed, you just lift up the lid and they slide in and out no prob.Speaking of which, you can purchase refill kits online for *much less* than replacing the entire 4-piece cartridge pack (the most inexpensive solution as it only costs around $60). That would be my recommendation. Just watch some how-to vids on YT for refilling this model...it's all posted there."," No big cons here for this model....although a bit heavy and slightly bulky compared to an ink-jet! Just make sure you have a decent amount of room for it, that's all.And no duplex, but that is known going in so not really a drawback. There's a slightly more expensive model if you need this feature (ie. the HL-3170cdw)."," An especially *fantastic* buy if purchased on sale (that's when I grabbed it). And I would *strongly recommend* reading/following the installation pamphlet* before installing it...because there are important tips to follow like shaking each individual toner cartridge vigorously before use (after removing the pink plastic safety packaging from it). This ensure the toner isn't at all clumpy from having settled since manufacturing.Also, be sure to go through the config options for it in your computer's printer settings after set-up. Play around with them all until you find a custom configuration that best suits your needs...which you can then use as your default. It's all fairly straight-forward.",3,3

Reliable(so far)., Size and weight (compared to inkjets or monochrome lasers).," Great laser printer for the price. I purchased this only because it was the cheapest wireless network printer available and was prepared for the worst.  Setup is a bit cumbersome, as you have to scroll through the alphabet using the up/down buttons on the printer to enter the network password, but after the initial setup, you don't have to touch the thing at all. I've have this for about 6 months now and printed about 1500 pages, mostly work documents. No problems, so it gets a thumbs up from me. The status software is showing black toner to be almost gone and the color toners between 1/2 and 1/3, so that's on par for the starter set. It's not the fastest(for a laser), but I don't print more than 50 pages at a time, so it isn't an issue. From my experience with this printer, I recently purchased a HL-3170cdw, which is the same printer but with duplex printing(was on sale, yay newegg!), for my parents to ween them off of inkjets.

This printer is extremely well equipped based on it's cost. It outperforms any HP printer I've owned in the past (which is the only other printer I've ever had at my home). As far as the first reviewer is concerned, the claim is ridiculous. I am the IT Manager at my job. all of our printers are enterprise level Ricoh and Kyocera's. the Kyoceras range in price from $1,200 to $2,000 and these are B/W only desktop sized printers (not much bigger than the Brother on this page). The Ricoh's are all MFP ranging from $7,500 on up to $36,000. out of ALL of these enterprise level, extremely efficient, equipped, printers. NONE of them will load labels from the tray!! why? I can help with that.A: when paper is loaded from the tray it passes through a series of rollers that eventually bring the media to the print level. as this paper passes through these areas it is maneuvered through a lot of twists and turns. Labels are a very have media, the have ends that fold over and glue just behind them, the rollers moving this media creates friction and heat.

Newegg has wonderful customer service and that is from experience over many years of many purchases (and Newegg also has amazing offers, freebies and other things all the time). While every company has its flaws (no one is perfect) and some time there might be a bad experience (which is indeed a serious thing) there's two sides to every story (and review).

(I understand this might not be accepted in which case I spent a minute or two that will never be returned to me - oh, the horrible loss - but I feel that this is something important and whether it's accepted is not my decision) I find it really sad that ignorance is the result of bad reviews. Not only ignorance but claiming things that are false. Of course looking at how many users found it useful that should be obvious but unfortunately not everyone looks at that and looks at the overall rating (which I know I am boosting it but realistically there should be no review in this incident). The reviewer wrote:""Printer is working fine BUT you cannot print labels from the tray...Printing from tray is a basic feature, if you miss a basic feature you should write it clearly.""Ignoring the fact the reviewer wrote somewhat contradictory statements for a moment, what is listed under details?""Versatile Paper Handling. 250-sheet capacity paper tray adjustable for letter or legal and a straight-through paper path via manual feed slot for envelope printing.""I admit I am fairly blind (though not legally) but I thought an envelope size is more similar to the size of labels (most certainly a label is not standard size or legal size whereas envelopes have various sizes). MANUAL FEED FOR ENVELOPE ...High technical level they claim? Well I assume that does not include reading comprehension and it's really quite sad that Newegg is blamed for the user not keeping the box (and the supposed problem is something that SHOULD be tested right away - especially from an experienced user!) and therefore not being able to return it. What can Newegg realistically do without the box? How is it their fault? How is it Brother's fault or Newegg's fault that [you] didn't read the terms let alone the item specifications? If they did accept it it would only increase prices for everyone (just like ""buying"" a wide-screen TV for a weekend hurts others by way of prices)! I think that they are going to buy from another store is good because your review makes not one - but two - companies look bad and all out of not reading properly to begin with (and not doing what a highly experienced user would do before throwing the box out: TEST).",30,34

These are fine secondary printers, provide long life and decent printing. However, I do not challenge the capabilities of these printers."," I have no doubt that the 2300 series will work as well, considering the virtually identical specifications and positioning. However, the shift seems to me little more than planned obsolescence, to counter the ubiquitous sourcing of the non-OEM TN450 toner, incompatible with the 2300s, but very widely available at about as low a price as you might care to name."," Although starter toners are typically good for only low output quantities, keeping spares provides a much wider range of parts deemed consumable than the toners. Notably in these series, the drum is rated for 12000 prints, but may last for far fewer. Unlike non-OEM toners, the drum alone is typically far more expensive than the whole printer. (This is even more true for more complex printers with more consumables, such as waste cartridges etc etc.) In 'D' models, which print duplex, spare printers are also a source of replacement gears and mechanical components for repair by the mechanically inclined. These last well in storage. If Brother is closing out the 2200 series I will be on the lookout for 4 or 5 more duplex models,. If you do not presently own the 2200 printers, then I would advise buying at least three of these 2300 units when they are at the right price, if closet space allows. You will eventually need the parts, and until then you will find places to set up the extra printers for some marginal utility. As even better advice, I would suggest purchase of a moderately compact multifunction device if space permits; even with duplex printing they are occasionally available nearly as cheaply, and the need for scanning and copying will discover itself quickly. But these devices build on the simple printer base, so the cautions about compatible toners and drums apply throughout the lines. For example, the MFC-7860DW takes the same toners and drums as the 2200 series, and the DCP-L2540DW takes the same as the 2300 series; stay within product families and you will get superior usability at reduced cost.",20,22

This little guy delivers that quite well.  It prints very very fast in standard mode and about 1/2 that in quiet mode.  I agree with the other reviewers that the toner is expensive, but you dont have to buy Canon brand toner.

This was less than 40 bucks with free shipping at the time of purchase (still is at this time) and I could have gotten it for only 10 bucks if I had bundled with another 110 bucks worth of stuff at the time of purchase. It's a very fast, very compact, duplex monochrome laser printer. The output is better than acceptable; actually it's quite good. Why only 4 stars? The price of replacement cartridges are about 2x that of toner for other printers. Drivers are also a real pain. I've detailed how to get Apple drivers below."," There's always a catch when a good printer is this cheap since Canon has to be losing money on the initial sale. Try to buy a replacement cartridge and you'll see where Canon makes the money on this. Original Canon toner (Canon 126) is roughly twice what I pay for my Brother and HP laser printer toner cartridges. You can try to use 3rd party toner, but I've found that rarely works for me. Your mileage may vary. The other issue is the drivers. Can be a bit of a pain to install for Windows, but is a real pain to locate for Mac OS X or Linux. There are no Apple drivers on any sites for North America. I located the Apple drivers in Australia and the U.K. Can't place links here, but U.K is easier to navigate. Go to Canon U.K., select Support, then select Consumer Products. You'll see a whole list of cameras, printer, etc., Select i-SENSYS. You'll find i-SENSYS LBP6200d listed there. Just select a version of OS X and you'll get the CAPT Printer Driver. At this time it's Ver.3.67 and it supports Mac OS X 10.5/10.6/10.7/10.8/10.9/10.10.",,6,6

This printer has quickly become my favorite.  It's very quick, has not had a single jam, but did once doublefeed some sheets.  Keep in mind we are running copier paper through it.  Duplexing is better than a Samsung color laser we had.I have had no networking issues with this printer at all!!.  Simply install the client ap on each computer that will print on this.  It's plugged right into a router.  It also works fine for a time on USB alone.  None of the PC's we print from has had a single issue with this printer.  In fact, when some windows settings got setup wrong after a restore, the client-driver software, can and does troubleshoot and repair itself.  GREAT!  I got this printer on sale for around $260.  A steal!.  GULP, until I have to replace the toner, which I can honestly say I will do, since the printer has been FLAWLESS!   I have not tried printing stacks of envelopes, but for one at a time prints, from MSWord.  It's quick and hassle free."," I wish I could figure out how to make 2400dpi the default dpi output, as well has changing the default brightness setting in the printer itself.

9SIA0AJ2TP5250,28-113-509,8/27/2013 5:00:43 PM,Olivia L.,Rock Solid Printer - CHEAP cost per page,4," Let's make things clear, The printer is ROCK SOLID!First off, we primarily use this printer to print out pick sheets, sales orders, and invoices with five Quickbooks equiped desktops & laptops. Our office purchased the HL-4150CDN about 2 years ago. To date it has performed as follows:Printed a total of 80,353 pages @ ~ $0.01 / pageSee below for the details.I've found that inkjet is about 10 cents per page on average.Of course, 90% of our prints are invoices, pick lists, and sales orders.  The rest of the prints are full color product sheets, line cards, and catalogue pages. Just so you know, the first set of toners didn't last because we were printing everything we could in full color, including personal items. It's the effect you get when you get a fancy new printer. Now that we have gotten over the shiney new toy & gotten over the fancy color feature, we use it for actual work. We are getting amazing results. We occasionally print full color maps and brochures, but it probably makes up 10% of total prints.Anyway, We are using this printer in an office environment. It's on the network, plugged in directly via Cat5 cable. It has no computer of it's own, but there are 5 computers that use this printer. Software is excellent in that it is lightweight and does not have excessive annoying features.,  Let me reiterate, unlike HP, the software is not bloated and not annoying. Overall, Networking is excellent, but not perfect. We did not get the wireless version, but we are able to hook it up via cat 5 It's hooked up to a mixed (wired & wireless) network via a cat 5 cable. It is configured to print via ip address, in peer to peer mode. It DOES NOT have a computer connected to it. We also have mac laptops running OS X and newer OS that print to it.I think less technical users may get overwhelmed with the amount of data you get from it's remote admin panel, but it is great for those of us tasked with maintenance and figuring out everyones computer problems. Regarding configuration, advanced functions, and remote accessibility, you can access the advanced menu remotely on your network via its IP address.It may seem pricey at first, but you really have to do the math. A comparable ink jet printer is going to cost anywhere from 4 to 10 times as much. Toner wise, it's DEFINITELY WAY CHEAPER THAN INKJET. On our last toner change we got almost 20,000 pages. YES 20k pages. In total we've spent about $1100 to $1200 on toner and drums and the cost per page is still in line with normal black and white only laser printers. See the cost breakdown below.Color toner (Cyan, Magenta, & Yellow) Average of 19,000 pages per color toner changeBlack  toner lasts about 11,500 - 19,000 pages on averageToners average about $67 - $80 each.Total toners replaced: 12 (6 black, 2 cyan, 2 magenta, & 2 yellow)About $800-900 in toners & $150 for a new drum unit that we are getting ready to replace.BUT at 80350 pages, thats only 1.1"," As far as cons are concerned, there are only three.1) The first con is that the actual price of the toner SEEMS high because you often time have to purchase 4 toners at once. But in reality, if you break down the cost per page, it's actually cheaper than any inkjet i've ever met. So the con here is that it appears to be expensive, but it's just relative to the output. It's an implied con, not really a real hard con.2.) The toners can actually last a little bit longer, but brother has programmed the printer to stop printing when the toners are at like 3%. They do this for safety reasons as well as to make sure you don't prematurely burn out the drums. So again, it's an implied con, not really a real hard con.3.) This is the only real con, as the two above were soft cons. This advanced features on this printer are not for your typical lazy home computer user. This printer has pro-level features and will be hard for the average user to figure out. It's advanced features can become overwhelming at times, especially if you make a big change in your network. But the brother website is very helpful and the software tools that the printer comes with are great."," I've always been an HP laser printer guy. I've always pushed HP, but now, I'm tired of the BLOATED drivers hp makes.Brother & Epson are my new favorites. They are both ROCK Solid and don't give you all the garbage software that HP gives you. This series and newer Brother printers have more features than the average user needs. But if you do booklets and pamphlets, this printer has advanced features you can use. I know I use them.",9,9

Instructions were VERY helpful.", Does take a lot longer to warm up and initiate print than my old inkjet.  Have not figured out how to print double sided.  Instructions says it can but the option is not present in the print dialogue.  Probably just need to download a newer driver/software version., I only print maybe 10 pages per month.  We wanted a color laser printer because the toner does not dry out like inkjet.  Complaints about it being slow is nominal to me.  It might be worse than more expensive laser printers but its faster than my old inkjet.  Just takes longer to warm up which is expected of any laser printer.    The paper tray does only hold about a third of a ream of paper.  Doesn't matter to me though since I print so little.

You can scan directly to a USB flash drive or print from one. The oddity - you can scan TO a PDF, JPEG or TIFF file, directly onto your flash drive. But the only files you can print via flash drive are JPEG files -- no PDF's. (Um, ok???) The Scan-to-PC buttons are helpful. Place your documents, press the button (once set up--easy), start the scan and when you get to your computer, the box will have popped up and be waiting for you to complete the job. I haven't used the fax. Loudness is as expected for a laser printer, not overly quiet but not horribly loud. Energy save comes on after awhile not using the button functions, but it does still print with energy save mode on. I have not used the Ethernet port or USB but assume it would be just as easy as Wi-Fi. Regular computer prints come out straight, crisp & clean."," The paper tray is wimpy but holds an amount of paper comparable to an ink jet printer. This type of Canon all-in-one has an annoying ""Adjusting"" feature which starts after a seemingly random number of pages printed or copied. During the adjustment you can start jobs but they will not process until the adjustment is complete. About a minute and a half or so. I noticed this in reviews for other similar Canon models. Cartridges are expensive just as they are for similar products of any brand. Comes with starter cartridges (less toner than regular ones). I have printed 9 color pages (which came out AWESOME) and even though the color pages were not printed as recently as the b/w, and none were overly heavy on yellow, the yellow cartridge is now reporting low. All of our settings default to B/W printing so I am not sure how after 9 pages this thing could possibly be low. The auto sheet feeder works, though everything scanned is slightly cockeyed, but not enough to be a deal breaker for me."," This all-in-one is a respectable product. I bought it for my home office with two desktops and one laptop computer. I did not have any problems installing the software or setting it up. I downloaded the most updated software directly from Canon's website (which I recommend) rather than installing it from the CD. Setup was easy. Follow the unpacking instructions EXACTLY as it is printed, as there are pieces of tape you might otherwise miss. It is about as large as I expected but not overly cumbersome to move with one person, even though two are recommended. Speed is as expected if you read the specs. Plenty fast but nothing to brag about. Overall I am satisfied with this unit. It seems to be as solidly built as other comparable units. The only thing I wish it had was 2-sided scan and print, but for the price I still think it is a good buy.",22,22

Every time I have scanned a double sided document, I get clearly visible ""ghosting"" of whatever is on the back side of the paper.  Scanner control console for windows frequently cuts an edge off of my documents.  Scanner service for windows (CC4) is fairly easy to use, but not as user friendly as many others I have used.

Newegg does not have aftermarket toner cartridges for sale so the only ones available are OEM from Brother.   The TN-225 series cartridges are US$70-US$80.  This works out to a toner cost of $0.10/page on average (at the mfg. stated 5% coverage). Aftermarket toner cartridges are available from other vendors for about US$45/cartridge.  Hopefully Newegg will start to stock those along with the OEM products.  I have been happy with the customer service of Newegg and would prefer to minimize the number of suppliers I deal with.

The quality is what I expect for a low end color laser printer. Do not buy this expecting spectacular picture quality. If your main reason for purchasing a printer is photos purchase one specifically designed for that function. I need color charts for school and this does that. Good for home use, printing school work, documents etc.  Easy wireless set up. Smart phone app to print directly from your phone. Printing from the phone is extremely slow (about 2 minutes for the phone to get the picture to the printer) when compared to printing form your PC. I was surprised to see the options for printing in the app itself(number of copies, paper size, image size, color or bw, paper type and more).I read a review somewhere that this printer doesn't print legal, The tray does expand to accept legal size paper. The tray is also adjustable to accept envelopes. I have not attempted printing on anything other than standard 8.5x11 white paper at this point but I wanted to point out that technically the printer is capable.(see cons)"," Dinging it one star because it was DOA on arrival(glad I got that free extra warranty now). Was going to RMA it with Newegg but I would have had to pay the shipping. Called Samsung support and they sent me a prepaid UPS ground label that I printed at work and dropped off at the UPS store the next day. The longest part of the whole return process was the ground shipping to the repair facility. Repair facility received it on Monday and had it repaired on Tuesday, Shipped UPS 2nd day air on Wednesday. Could have had it Friday but couldn't get out of work to sign for it.The paper tray always sticks out about 2.5 inches when loaded with 8.5x11 paper(or larger). This alone wouldn't dissuade me from purchasing it. I might hesitate if I printed a lot of legal as it would stick out almost 6 inches if I did and didn't have the dedicated space(which I don't) for a 6 inch overhang.", If you catch this on a good sale and are using it for home/home office (maybe even small office use) use go for it. Supplies are expensive. But for me it's cheaper than ink jet when I factor in the number of times a print cartridge dried out in between uses. Look into this if you're a heavy printer,0,1

It works with Samsung's app on Windows Phone to print from mobile phones, but again, that's contingent upon the printer maintaining its wireless connection.  It prints with a generic cartridge, until you flash the firmware."," Wireless connection drops repeatedly, even after a firmware flash.  Flashing the firmware on mine PERMANENTLY disabled printing because I had a generic cartridge in it."," Throw it against the wall repeatedly until it stops working or you can just leave it plugged in and it'll stop working on its own.  You'll rip your hair out trying to figure out why it repeatedly stops working on your network despite having assigned it a static IP at the printer and a MAC reservation on your router.  Go buy a HP.  Granted HP costs more, but at least it works more than a week at a time.  I had to frequently connect to the Samsung via USB cable, reset the printer and reconfigure it every week just to allow wireless printing.  It would print over the course of the week until it flaked out again.  Samsung wanted funds up-front to fix it, but the cost to repair exceeded what I paid for the printer.

At full MSRP it would be a little over-pricedSpeed - Only takes 10 - 20 seconds to wake up and warm up, and then, as it says, prints 20 ppm.Really the best thing about this is that the toner doesn't dry out like inkjet cartridges do (this is true of all laser printers).

In about 9 mo. and no more than 45,000 pages each, 3 of the units were totally unusable. 2 units just started printing all fuzzy.

Upon deploying one for a single user, I opted to use the USB connection as there was no additional network port and it seemed silly to buy a hub for one extra device. However, that would have been the easier path.The stock installer has some sort of setting up period referred to as the ""Smart Installer"" in which the printer does not present itself to the computer as a typical printer where you can specify drivers and the like. It continuously failed at 99% (Win7x64Pro) stating that the installation had taken too long. An observation with which I wholeheartedly agree, as this was several tens of minutes after the initiation of the whole process. I eventually discovered that using HPs Universal Driver system allowed me to install it in a more traditional manner, but the whole experience left me disheartened."," For what it does, it's a great device.

Navigation through system functions and information displayed on the LCD is really great (this is never a purchase criterion for me, but it's always a delightful surprise). Admin web interface is one of the best I've seen for a printer in this price range. Has required zero maintenance since installation. Fairly small for a 35PPM duplexing printer. Has a bloatware-free driver package option (which is becoming increasingly rare these days)."," I only mention this because I feel like if I can't come up with a con for something, then I haven't really evaluated it: the manual feeder tray is a little on the flimsy side. I don't really think it's going to snap off or anything, but the paper width sliders are a little wobbly and could be easier to adjust. That being said, it's not a reason to avoid purchasing this printer at all."," Around a year ago I took a job as I.T. Coordinator for a county government agency. One thing immediately made me groan my first day in the office: almost every workstation had its own printer. Anybody who's ever worked in I.T. knows that printers are one of the biggest technological headaches in any office, and this place had tons of them. Unfortunately, the way the office was set up, most of them were actually necessary (meaning no migration to shared printers). However, the majority of these printers were junky old Lexmarks that were constantly failing in one way or another, and repairs often cost more than the value of the printer itself. Once I joined on, I started replacing these printers with the LJ Pro 400 M401DNE when they failed. LaserJet has been my laser printer line of choice for years and years, and while there have been a few models I've been less than happy with, most have been solid reliable workhorses.

Everything is built into windows 7 under (devices and printers) on the start menu. click the printer and bam! it's all there.", I did notice once that it took awhile to go back into standby mode and was setting off my UPS fan on and off. I'm guessing this printer uses a lot of power when it's not in standby mode.This never happened with any other printer.When printing a picture(monochrome obviously) i did notice that there's some white lines. I was informed to slowly slosh the cartridge around to fix that. It could also be that I haven't broken in the printer yet. Still have to try that.," This crucial note that ultimately made me want to venture into laser territory. The newer HP inkjets have a chip that tells you that your ink has expired and won't allow you to print. I had ink fresh out of the packaging that I bought a year before that I couldn't even use... And the printer would constantly tell me I'm low of a certain color and I had to press a button to start printing. The printer's cpu died from leaving it in sleep mode which would consistently reboot it self endlessly. That printer just got  new print cartridges too. So I decided instead of wasting $100 in ink, buy the same model and put those cartridges in the new one. WRONG! They're bound to the printer! I couldn't use them in the new one.... That was the last straw. I returned it and bought this printer. Mid $40's for a high yield genuine Brother laser cartridge is beyond incredible. I never really needed to print color. 99% of what you print out is probably text anyway. I can't be happier.",7,8

I only made sure that whether toner cartridges or ink, that they were legitimate HP product and kept them clean (An occasional use of an air can does wonders). I am certain no one cares about reading my opinion as to why they may have had any issues, and I am not interested in even going there. I will, however, say this much; in my lengthy experience with HP printers, should I ever need a printer, I will assess my needs and buy an HP intended to meet them. I am certain there are other great brands out there, but for me there is only one way to go. Whether the 400 will last as long as my 4, I do not know.

Every couple of weeks I'll try and print a document and the printer doesn't respond. I can print a test page, can see it in my Devices and Printers, I can manipulate every single thing about it -- but it won't print. Restarting the printer doesn't work but restarting my computer occasionally does. It may seem like a small annoyance to have to restart the computer every now and then, but I primarily use this printer for work and I can't always restart my computer when I'm occupied with a remote connection. This isn't just isolated to my computer, either, as other computers and several mobile devices cannot print either -- but each can the printer and have the same control. Brother's solution is to reinstall the software suite, which does work, but I don't care to mess around with that every couple of months. Sometimes I simply can't restart my computer when I'm working. Reinstalling is the only solution offered by Brother and I'm doubting that it will get fixed."," I'm reviewing here in the hopes that Brother will actually look at some of its product reviews. This printer is great for casual use and fulfills practically every claim, but being forced to restart your computer to print is annoying. It's especially infuriating if you are unable to restart your computer because you're remotely connected and are constantly in video conferences. Most people don't use this printer professionally, so it should work fine. Not everyone will experience these issues either, but unfortunately, I did and still am.

The software was easy to install, and the Quick Installation Guide walked me through all the steps of installing both the hardware and the software.  I chose to connect wirelessly through my wireless network.  The software recommended I connect via USB for that part, which I did.  It sensed my network settings on its own, asked me if it had selected the correct network, connected the printer to the network on its own, and told me to disconnect when I was finished.  It could not have been easier.  The whole process did take about twenty minutes, which might seem a little long, but I didn't have any problems with the actual installation.The print quality was very good and very fast.  It took less that ten seconds from the time I okayed a print job to when the printer started printing, which was far quicker than my laser printer at work.

Other printers from brothers/lexmark provide these as standard feature. So you can connect it to only one computer through a USB port. But then, it doesn't come with the USB cable-, making the printer unusable.It states that legal paper can be used on the printer- but that's only for printing, not for scanning or copying. Since it doesn't come with a feeder, this option is pretty much missing.It doesn't have a USB port connection to insert memory cards/ thumb drives."," I am returning this product as I can't use it.

Print quality excellent. Scans an 8 1/2 x 11 letter in 4-5 seconds. Scan quality is excellent, None- does what it is supposed to and does it real fast., Some reviewers did not like as it does not come with a USB cable. Most printers don't as the manufacturer has no way of knowing what length the customer might need. You can buy the needed length cable locally or online for just a couple of dollars,7,8

And now I have a network wireless printer (on my to-do list is to make it dedicated so I can print off-network). *2 Trays - main tray I use for regular paper, and the second tray I use for shipping labels. *CRISP blacks, this is especially nice for my USPS labels that I print. Plus it is repeatable, whereas inkjet printers tend to decide on how saturated the sponge is, or if it is the first print of the day. *Literally takes < 2 seconds if not less to come out of sleep (even setup in my network). I can print 5 pages (duplex) and the printer will be done by the time I walk into the room. *I paid $69.99 about 2 months before this review, and that came with the sample toner. I have gone through maybe 200-300 pages and the original toner is still going strong. *Cheap non-OEM toner, I am ordering a replacement toner now (I have seen them for ~$20 on newegg). When I use the non-oem I will try to track exactly how many prints it does and how long it was in the printer for and review on that too, but it may be a while as I do not use the printer much. *Good scanning, as much as you would expect from the $5000 standup printer stations."," *Even though it has two trays, I have yet to figure out how to tell the printer to use a specific one. As it simply checks the non-main tray first, if nothing is there, then it will use the main tray. But if there is something in the secondary tray (my printing labels)  then it will print right onto those. It is simple enough, but it sucks if I forget to remove my labels.. maybe this option can be fixed in an update to software?"," *If you know what you're doing, it is very easy to make this a ""wireless"" printer for your network. *Very cost effective. *Sure it does not do color, but do you really need it? And most cheaper laserjets will use a ""one-toner-for-all-colors"" kinda thing, but if one color runs out, you have to replace the entire thing.. not very efficient if you ask me.*They should make a coin-op attachment for this, it would be killer as these could be setup in a ton of public places that got rid of their expensive standup printers (like post offices/library).

9SIABB74AK2833,28-102-730,1/24/2012 6:00:17 AM,Ari A.,Perfect little printer,5," I needed to go back to using a laser for the first time in five years after getting fed up with the short life and cost of ink cartridges, as well as slow start up times of inkjet printers.  The Canon MF3010 has not disappointed.  It's much faster than my older circa-2001 laser printer, much cheaper (especially when on sale at Newegg), and has the added benefit of a scanner/copier function.  It also has an incredibly small footprint, which opened up valuable desk space.  Finally, the quality of printouts is great for personal use - it's probably not the highest quality laser printer, but it's just about the cheapest, so that's fine."," The printer is so small that it cannot hold a paper tray.  It uses a fold-down paper tray like small inkjets.  Because it isn't as sturdy and doesn't look quite as good when the tray is down, I keep the tray closed, but that means I have to load paper every time I print.  You also have to flip out the output paper tray if you don't want printouts to fall out of the printer.  In addition, it doesn't have a duplex function, which my inkjet had - again, it's just so small that the duplex feeder probably couldn't fit, but that's a bit disappointing as even cheap inkjets have that.  Finally, it doesn't have a true control panel, just a couple of buttons, which makes its scan/copy functions very limited.  You can copy directly from the printer, but for scans, you must initiate the scan command from the computer.  That means digging through Windows menus every time, which is a bit less convenient than my full-function inkjet."," The printer advertises a very fast startup speed, and as far as I'm concerned, it delivers.  If you need to print something quickly, this printer just flies past inkjets, which have to reset their cartridges often.Note that the printer comes with a ""starter"" cartridge, and while the full cartridges have a 1600-page yield, this one is probably lower (it isn't specified).  I'm sure it's still way more than any inkjet, but if you're a heavy user, you'll be spending nearly the cost of the printer on a new toner soon, and this printer won't be a good value for you.One last thing - this printer does not have wireless, so consider that if you're planning to use it in a home office.In general, this printer won't disappoint if you don't have unrealistic expectations - the price is excellent for a laser with copy/scan functions.  It's small, it's fast, and it's prints fairly well.  But it isn't as convenient to use as a larger laser printer would be.",7,7

It's output is selectable from 300 dpi to 1200 dpi and is clear and sharp. Warm-up time is virtually a non-issue and is measured in seconds even if it hasn't been printing for hours.It's UI is a tad complicated but you can figure it out pretty easily in a few minutes if you're patient. Once you get stuff input and it has at least 24 hours for the internal battery to get fully charged and stuff safely in memory you shouldn't have to worry about it.

Copying is fast and the feeder works as expected. Scanning is as fast as copying and the files just show up on your computer. Size-wise, for an all-in-one, it doesn't take up a lot of room on the desk/table.Update almost a year after purchase: On our third or fourth generic cartridge, still works great. My wife's a teacher and she uses it very often to make two-sided, multi-page handouts. Prints duplex (both sides), copies and scans very fast.

Oh - also - does duplex scanning flawlessly - often a weak spot of multifunctions machines, if they have it at all."," A lot of people have complained about the lack of documentation and the difficulty of setting this up, esp. with wifi. I'm moderately+ tech smart, so so far it hasn't been a problem for me. But I can easily seen how for the 'average joe' this could turn into hair pulling frustration.

It was the recommended successor to the HL-2070N I had in the past, which served me faithfully for years.I got this on sale. The real paradox to me was how someone on an auction site purchased my 7 year old laser printer for more than the cost of this unit, as this unit is clearly is superior in many ways without any drawbacks. I merely wanted a new printer with a darker color scheme, and within one day sold my old printer and got this printer on sale here on Newegg for exactly the price my auction proceeds granted me. I'm still sitting here laughing about it.The only thing I don't like is the color scheme. The top is a nice black, the rest is a dark gray.

When I set up the admin console web application, I entered a password. The web application accepted the password on creation. However when I went to log in, I found out that they do different input filtering on the password log in and would not allow me to enter the password (it was ""too long""). Consequently I found myself locked out of the device. I did some google searching and searching of Samsung documentation and was unable to find a process for a factory reset on this specific model. It seems other similar models can do a factory reset, just not this one. If factory reset is indeed supported, I would love to know. I, however, was not able to find it. Power cycling did not work. I have not since been able to log into my printer's admin interface. Perhaps most disconcerting is that Samsung does not have a good grasp of how it does input filtering. This device is probably ripe for a security researcher to find injection vulnerabilities. This, sadly, is about par for the course with consumer grade electronics.More importantly, the  network card died about a month or two after purchasing. I used to work as professional network engineer: the problem is that the NIC on the printer is dead. I need a RMA under warranty. I contacted Samsung support. Their brain dead technician wanted to remotely admin my computer and install some bloatware on my PC so they could troubleshoot the dead NIC over the network. That makes no sense. What are you going to do? Ping to verify that the network card in fact does not work? I also had to explain the difference between Ethernet and WiFi.  I bought this printer to specifically be a (Ethernet) network printer.So I have a few options at my disposal:1) See if the WiFi card works. However this would require that I poke holes in my inter-vlan firewall which isolates my wireless access point from the rest of my LAN (not ideal -- I have little trust if WiFi authentication). Not even sure I can do that at this point however due to the password issue stated above.2) Buy a raspberry pi and use it as a CUPS print server. (I really don't want to support a cups server)3) Use the printer as a USB printer (annoying)4) hope that Samsung does the right thing and RMAs their useless product. (Not Promising!)At the moment it is effectively a USB printer. A 5th option is to write this off as a loss and buy a printer from a company that doesn't suck.

Lower power (well, for a laser lol). Great sleep mode (power savings). Low maintenance. Low cost of consumables. Sturdy. This is a GREAT home laser, so long as your duty cycle is less than a few thousand pages per year."," It can be a bit sensitive (sometimes) to paper types, and particularly weights. You don't want to go much lighter, and you don't want to go with the really heavy stuff. You want to pretty much stick with a 20 pound weight. Just find something it likes, and you'll be good. Oh. And as I recall, the toner cart' it comes with is the smaller capacity one, so you'll be buying a new one fairly soon (that is really my only dissatisfaction, and I barely remembered it before posting)."," I've owned an older version ML2825 since about 2005/6 (purchased at a well known local office store that begins with an ""S"" lol). It's on it's 3rd (4th??) toner (they're pretty inexpensive, in the $50 range). It has always been trouble free, through reams of printing. It's been moved a few times as we've moved (including an 800 mile jaunt from CA to WA a couple of years ago), and has rarely missed a beat. And once we got past learning what paper it ""liked"" fed (and you can count the number of paper jams we've experienced over the years on one hand), it has just chugged along, like the reliable little performer it has truly proved to be. I do a lot of duplex printing (manuals and what not); trust me, if a tiny printer was going to jam, duplex is where it will happen lol (and, pretty much don't on the little Sammie). I liked the ML2825 so much, I bought its color CL310 sibling when I came across one in a ""good deal"" a couple of years after (we don't use it nearly as much since it doesn't support duplexing, but it too has been a reliable performer, when we needed color); that was when we offed the last inkjet we owned (never to look back at high maintenance color printing, and dried out hyper expensive ink cartridges ...and thank the big guy up there - a euphemism, since apparently I just ran afoul of Neweggs comment filter lol - for digital pix sharing, eh). Oddly, I was wondering the other day - on the occasion of having to pull the toner out, and swoosh it side-to-side as it was getting low, and a few pages had streaks ...and yes, that is *the* sign you need to buy new toner, and yes, that trick worked and the last hundred pages have been just fine - about it's age, and what I was going to get when the sad day came to look for a replacement. Well, thank you on-sale-at-Newegg! Problem solved. I'll just pick up another. Highly recommended. The best personal printer I've owned over the years (I'm a sys admin w/almost 30 years in IT btw: and mostly I spec' those large AIO network monsters with Ricoh and Canon engines that have 50K pages a month duty cycles for my clients ...so my praise for the little Sammie is based upon some solid printer experience over the years ...I'm just sayin', lol - and as always YMMV - but this is a heckuva nice little home office printer that you can do far worse than).

NewEgg has sales from time to time on compatible ink cartridges.  Some are better than others but I recommend picking up the spare catridge whenever there's a good sale.

What else do you want? Everything was included in a different box because the old one was thrown out. Some documentations were included. Power cables were put back. Not too happy with HP's poor quality standard on the newer laserjets. The old ones use to run FOREVER. Not too happy at how Newegg dealed with this.",6,9
9SIA0AJ2TS0303,28-115-635,1/23/2011 11:20:36 AM,FarVision N.,Updated Review,5, Very nice Printer, Workable issues," I found that if you manually roll the papers with your fingers, on each edge, that you can undo the curl inherent with this printer.  This goes for 20, 50 or 100 sheets.  This is not a deal breaker.  Just jog the papers and uncurl them yourself.Additionally, the 1000ct estimate on the starter cartridge is dead on.  I had a ream (500ct) pages that I was printing on both sides for, for a mailing.  Ran into the popup notification and center sheet fading right in the last 10 or so pages.  Shook the toner to squeeze another 5 or so pages out, then dumped it.",2,3

Print driver package is embedded into printer web page, which is very handy for network installs.  I never touched the CDROM.  Single page printout has normal HP network stats.Supplies and all test pages available from printer web page.Some surprising technology in this printer.  IPV6.  SLP and LPD.  Bonjour.  SNMP 1 and 2.  Toner usage stats and estimated remaining after a little bit of usage."," Odd startup settings - Jam Recovery is set to Off.  Which means when something happens, the printer dumps the rest of your print job, which is ridiculous.  Change this in the web setup place.The Duplexer is turned OFF by default in the web interface.  This makes the print driver not show the equipment properly, so one if left wondering why they are getting manual feed popups on a duplex printer.  Changed in web setting.Curls paper!  Biggest knock of this product.  When duplexing, it will curl the edges of your paper.  24 Lb paper in my initial test.  Very noticeable curl.  Practically a bowl.  This makes taking a print job directly to a folding machine completely impossible.  You must lay the print job flat and let the pages rest so they uncurl.  Quite ridiculous for an office printer."," Quiet Mode simply runs the printer at half speed.  Less thermal overload, less fan run speed.  This is a very fast duplexing monochrome printer, with nice high quality crisp fonts and text.  Printer has some large flaws.   Curling paper will jam your paper folder.  I had to manually pull out a paper from my folder for the first time in over 500 sheets - with test paper 3 or 4 that came out of this printer.  Paper must be relaxed post-print for proper folding, which definitely increases job time.  I may have spent a little more if I would have known I had to manually watch my papers like I was baking a pie.Other duplexer is inkjet, which is far too slow to use.  However, with paper curl wait time, it may be a wash.",3,4

I got it on sale so that was a bonus. The same printer was literally twice the price at local retailers. Energy star efficient (yay)! The first toner that came with the printer lasted me almost a year in university (hundreds of pages printed a month. I hate reading at the computer). I reuse paper in this guy to save trees. A few times, I've forgotten to remove a staple or a paper clip when reloading. This is enough normally to trash a printer. But not this one. It didn't even jam."," The LCD display is dim if you're not looking at it at the right angle. My father has the same printer and keeps his on his desk. He can't see the LCD unless he gets up. I keep mine below my desk and can always see it. Since the menu is simple, it's not really an issue for me. Not enough to take off an egg anyway."," I'd never heard of Brother before.

The scanning software doesn't work on one of the computers, though it works on others. It scans but the PDF files are unreadable.  It does work, however, if the scan is initiated via Adobe Acrobat Pro, so in the end it's fine. Multipage documents also feed automatically in this way. The bigger issue has been the envelop/manual feed. Nine times out of ten, the machine reports a paper jam whenever you insert a standard 10 envelop for printing.

No wifi connection however this feature is questionable anyway if you have it connected to a wireless router. Monochrome output which is perfect for economical printing.

Toner replacement is reasonably priced. This printer replaced another All in one Inkjet printer which constantly had dried up ink cartridges from lack of use.

I installed first with USB and then again with Ethernet, and both worked fine."," I had trouble the first time I installed the Linux LPR driver, and uninstalling took some mucking with internals -- the postrm script in /var/lib/dpkg/info/ failed on the lprng or lpd line, so I had to append ""||true"" to them.  The second attempt worked fine.  This was pretty quick for me to figure out.  The Ubuntu GNOME Administration-Printing thing found it immediately.When I print plain text from Linux, it's a little light.  But I haven't tried correcting it."," I don't know why other other people are complaining about noise.  When it's printing, the sound is in line with other printers that I've heard. When it's idle, it's quieter than my desktop, and my desktop is quiet.  The fans go quiet a few seconds after the last sheet comes out.  And if it's still a problem: there's the power switch at right side back, and it takes maybe 25 seconds total for it to power up again.",None,None

A color laser would have been ideal with wireless networking.  The duplexer is nice which can be used printer or copying.  Setup was very easy on the network.," The main problem is when you print anything, even a single page, the cooling fan motor on the side kicks in and runs for approximately 15 minutes.

No problem faxing, even with digital phone service. Reasonable costs for consumables. Unlike some other brands that shall go unnamed, the drivers aren't ridiculously bloated, and don't require an excessive amount of time to install. Was a breeze to install."," The output tray is kind of funky, tends to spew the printouts onto the floor and has a small capacity.

The initial software allows 5 PCs and setup includes the option to install printer only drivers. ( ideal for my wife's netbook )The scanning software is a great compliment to unit. Two sided scanning is straightforward. Just load an scan first side, turn the sheets over and pick scan second side and everything comes out collated correctly in a pdf. Even has a software option to automatically rotate any portrait sheets to a vertical (readable) orientation.  The unit seems solidly built so I'm crossing fimgers that the durability is there as well. NewEgg delivery in three days. Very impressed with purchase experience!!!"," Linux support is not there. Brother website gives some advice, but no joy so far in getting any output from my Fedora 14 box."," When it came time to spend another ~$100 on ink cartriges I decided to put the money towards a replacement printer. One set of Ink costs amounted to 50% of the money to buy this unit and the starter cartridge gives me the same number of pages I get from an ink set. Replacement cartriges are half the cost of ink and are rated at three to four times the number of pages. Only trade off was giving up color.Faster output, lower ink/toner cost, Win7 x64 support,  no hassle install, and great delivery timing.",3,3

N82E16828113832,28-113-832,10/5/2016 6:30:28 AM,Michael S.,Epic For Small Business,5," Fast printing of extremely high quality, using the least expensive ink of any printer we compared.  LD brand ink has worked great for us, printing thousands of high color, high gloss, product labels.  No annoying popups saying, ""counterfeit / remanufactured ink detected"", when using reasonably priced ink.  Great reliability so far, after lots of use.  8 networked PCs print to this printer in our office, and there have been none of the typical ""queue"" errors we see often with other brands...  Really a no-brainier.UPDATE - October 2016: Here we are, just a couple months shy of two years of what I'd consider heavy use...  I never update positive reviews with more positive info, but this printer is seriously the best office machine investment my small company has made.  We probably print just shy of 1,000 (full color, glossy label) sheets weekly with this unit, and have gone through hundreds of ink cartridges, all without this machine breaking down.  It's the most reliable color printer I've owned.  Like all laserjet printers I've seen ANYWHERE NEAR this price point, this one can leave smudges every once in a long awhile, but that's the only (slight) downside.  If & when this printer ever dies on us, we'll be replacing it with another HL-3170CDW.  During the 20 months of use, we've only ever used aftermarket ink...  Certain brands are better than others, and we continue to have the best luck with LD.  We used Brother brand replacement drum units."," At first, we were getting some smudges & ink inconsistencies when we used high-gloss label paper. Setting up different printing profiles for different styles of paper made a HUGE difference, and is incredibly important if you want the best quality prints.  It took us a few tries to nail-down the specific settings, but once that was done.  Below, I've copied our favorite preferences.Our Glossy Label Paper Settings:Print Quality: 2400dpiSource: Tray (manual feed is a pain, if you do any volume printing)Media Type: GlossDocument Type: Photo/Image(All others set to default - Hit ""Add Profile"" to save this setting)Our Matte Label Paper Settings:Print Quality: 2400dpiSource: TrayMedia Type: LabelDocument Type: Photo/Image(All others set to default - Hit ""Add Profile"" to save this setting)If you are printing to standard paper, all default settings work perfectly.  None of this was reason to lose an egg, just a lack of experience with the printer."," UPDATED October 2016:We analyzed MANY color laser printers before settling on the HL-3170.  1) No HP (or other brand) bloatware.  No non-printer related mandatory software bundles.  Simple, non-intrusive device management without any additional unwanted stuff.  I can list on one hand the number of printer companies doing that in 2016.2) Incredibly low cost of ink that lasts awhile, via LD (the brand we use) and other manufacturers.  Considering the quantity of pages to dollar, this is a huge benefit.  We've used a few brands of ink in the 20 months of use (as of this update), and LD continues to be our go-to brand.3) Excellent reliability, even after tens (hundreds?) of thousands of pages printed.  We have 8 PCs networked to this printer, and the performance is just stellar.4) While we skimped out on the non-branded ink, we DO use Brother brand drums.  For the record, those have been replaced only one time in the heavy use of this machine over nearly 2 years.",4,4

At first everything looked okay, I installed the drivers, configured wireless, and was able to print. But after a while the printer started to drop wireless signal for no reason, tried to troubleshoot myself, tried forums, tried to reset, reconfigure, etc. Nothing worked so I gave up and put it on Ethernet. It worked for a year then it stopped printing duplex pages, every time I printed duplex it jammed the paper inside. Again tried to fix the problem with no luck, but ok, I can live without duplex printing. But after another half a year, it stopped working completely. Now it shows B0 error on display, customer support said there is malfunction of some sort of board that has to be replaced and that costs 200 bucks :) So I was told to think about buying a new printer.

I'd rank it as ""near photo"" quality (on standard or glossy paper). It's good for 99% of average printing.

I was impressed by most every element from it's looks to its setup and even the tech support (though they didn't resolve any of the issues I encountered--they were there and helpful).  I love that you have various options for connectivity, auto-duplexing, easy access to internals, and it has a relatively good manual (as I found some of my answers to issues I encountered in there).  I didn't buy this printer at New Egg (shame on me!) cause when I bought it, New Egg was not the best price!  I got it from BandH.com for like $179 and that was with 3 yr warranty.  I selected this printer cause I just couldn't beat that deal (at the time) for I needed a good color laser for my Small Business needs."," Though I like the manuel tray, it's been kind of a pain.  The manual instructs you to only feed 1 item thru it at a time regardless of what your using (card stock, envelopes, labels...).  And for me, with this printer, when the paper medium is pulled thru, it never pulls it thru straight--resulting in printouts that do not print straight down the page (output prints at a slight angle).  Tech support claimed this was due to the paper weight/type being used, but it doesn't matter what I feed it, the rollers pull the paper thru at an angle.  I have to hold the guides against the paper as it feeds thru--this helps but does not fully correct the issue.  Also the rollers do leave an impression on the printed output (I was told by Brother tech support this would happen-heat from fusing process and type of paper used), it's not detrimental and though it fades slightly over time it's still visible."," My biggest problem was when I started using the printer, my colors and blacks were all washed out (blues were green, blacks were dark grey) and Brother tech support, though helpful, did not resolve anything for me. I've worked as an A+ tech so I asked Brother's Sr. Level tech if possibly the toner was the issue (answer: NO).  It was the issue.  I'd ordered toner shortly after getting the printer cause I didn't know how long the starter cartridges would last and once I got going with the printer I couldn't afford to be caught in an ""out of toner"" position.  After they arrived (and these were re-manufactured), I replaced the Brother Starter cartridges. And to my delight, my colors fell in line (still not perfect) but sooo much better and now I could use the printer for what I bought it for without huge color adjustments in Photoshop.

The antivirus did not however, interfere when I was using the SCAN function from the computer, only when I was trying to SCAN 'to' the computer fro the printer itself."," All in all, I wanted a simple, dependable Monochrome laser printer / copier / scanner that could be set up wirelessly on my home network.  Brother does not disappoint on this model, it is a great home use device.  My set up : ISP to cable modem, then cable modem to NetGear wireless router.  I have two Desktops (in different bedrooms) connected to the Wireless router via LAN cable.  Our laptop and two iPhones connect wirelessly.   All of these can print to this printer and scan from and scan to.  Just remember, you have to install the software on each of the computers, except the iPhones, of course.  Here is what I did and in what order once my Printer arrived:1) Read the quick set up guide (there are some shipping protectors you have to remove, i.e. tape, orange pieces, etc)2) Add paper (not included) in the paper tray and install the toner (included)3) Turn on the printer4) Not a step, but I plan to use this printer wirelessly, so no USB and LAN cables are needed.  Only cable connected is the power cable-----The next steps belowe were done via info learned from watching a youtube video from Brother for this specific printer (just search for 'Wireless Setup without using a USB cable DCPL2520DW DCPL2540DW' 5) Install the software from the included CD ROM.  During the install, it asks if you want to check for a newer version, make sure you check that box6) When it came to the part where I was told to press the 'WiFi' button I the printer, I first had to ensure my Wireless functionality was enabled on my Wireless Router (I have a button on my router to turn WiFi on and off).  I also had to hit the button on my router to enable 'WPS'  I did that and my router's WPS symbol started flashing.  NOW I hit the 'WiFi' button on the printer and waited a minute or two until the printer connected to the wireless router.  during this process, the 'WiFi' button will flash on the printer.  Once it connects, it will glow steady green.  Once that is done it will printer a report automatically and the software will continue to install.7) Once the printer was connected wirelessly, I printed from and scanned from this computer.  Worked great.  Also tested the copy function of the printer.8) I test printed from each of my iPhones, and the iPhones were able to see this printer.   Printed just fine.  I did not have to do anything to the iPhones.9) I now went to the other desktop and laptop and installed the software from the CD ROM just like I did on the first computer (you won't have to go through connecting the printer wirlessly again, since you just did that with the first computer.  Tested the ability to print from and Scan from these additional computers and all worked great.10) Now I went to the Printer and tried to use the SCAN button. I tired to SCAN a doc 'TO' one of the computers on the network, but it did nothing and there was no activity incoming on any of the computers.  I went to each computer and had to Add Trusted Device to my Antivirus Software  and after that I had to go to each computers control panel / Scanner and Cameras, right click on the Brother Scanner that will be there after you install the software, and then click on the 'Scan To' button tab.  There is where you register the computer to the SCAN TO functions of the scanner (You can pick the Name for your computer that will show up on the display window on the printer and you can even set a PIN#)11)  Went back to the printer and pressed the SCAN button, now I can choose from any of the computer I want to send the scan to.Remember, you will only get a list of computers to scan to if they are on and connected.  If only one computer is on,  you won;t get a list of computers to choose from and it will default to the computer that is on.All in all, very pleased with the price per features per quality with this printer.  Would highly recommend this Laser printer to anyone.  I think the newer models have  larger screen display, but this model has the lcd 2 line display and it is just fine.",1,1

It does what you would expect a printer/copier to do., One reason I got this printer was for the WLAN.  So far I have not been able to make the WLAN work. The manual is worthless for setting this up.  The printer setup wizard claimed the connection was OK but I could not print a test page and applications could not find the printer.  I got some settings corrected manually but no success. Online chat helped and made some progress but failed.  My son (an IT pro) made more progress but  the WLAN connection kept dropping out.  He finally plugged in the Ethernet cable and I am using that now.  I will try the online chat again now that I have fixed the home network problem they ran into and could not solve., If you have a new computer  with Win 10 the WLAN setup might be a lot easier.

The software and driver package on the CD is not very intuitive.  First I had it setup with a USB connection, then I configured wireless settings.

9SIA9B54NC2845,28-113-937,7/1/2016 8:52:01 PM,Mark S.,Typical Brother quality - solid.,5," Duplex printing. Document feeder. Good paper handling. Paper tray does not stick out. Wireless. Air Print works well. Great on a network. Configurable via the unit itself, a web-based interface over the network or the drivers/software. Including software is not bloated and does the job. Scan to PDF/Email. Scan to any computer on the network. Fast. Good print quality. Energy efficient. What's not to like?"," None. It's a low-cost laser MFC and it beats expectations. Does not have duplex scanning via document feeder, but this can be worked around with software."," I needed a wireless printer, something ideally with a document feed scanner. I paid less than $130 for it and I couldn't be happier. I always recommend Brother products and now that I just nabbed a new one, I'm going to keep recommending them.Drivers and software suite is light and doesn't need to run on startup or hang around at all to use the scan to PC / email / pdf etc functions.Air print works great. Wife is delighted to be able to print recipes and  shipping labels from her phone. One plug. No messing with USB or LAN cables. Paper is contained within the base, nothing sticking out.Duplex printing!It's a bit big. It's almost 30 pounds. But it's sturdy. Plastic is solid enough. This isn't enterprise class but I'm pretty impressed about what a $125 printer can get you these days.I'm very impressed with the scanning and paper handling. Haven't tried the flatbed for scanning a photo or anything but reviews indicate that it's quite good for what it is. So far working fine on my Windows 10 machines and my iMac and MacBooks. Configuring the printer from the small LCD panel is a little clunky but it works. I had the thing connected to my network before installing any software on the computers. Configurable by a web interface. Updated the firmware within the web interface and it really felt like I was in a router. Never updated a firmware for a printer before, so that's a first for me.Toner is relatively cheap. Not sure if it will block me from using generic carts with a chip. I figure I'll find out sooner or later, should probably check the Brother support forums.Copying is a breeze, just walk up to the thing and pop in the paper and hit copy and you're done. Duplex scanning is one feature it doesn't have but the thing is a bit of a tank and that would probably make it really huge.What I am really excited about is scan to PDF. I deal with a lot of documents and get paper sources, but a lot of my work is using digital content, so being able to take a stack of documents or a report and digitize it is great. The best thing is I can scan a doc to PDF and direct it to a specific computer on the network. The PDF just appears in a folder on my desktop. I'm going to see if I can change the default folder to a onedrive folder. That would put it over the top. Design is basic, clean. All the paper guides and trays and such fold in and collapse out of the way if you're not using them so it's a nice clean box, not some winged creature that needs a 2-foot radius from all directions to not get whacked.Good buy.

9SIA9B54NC2845,28-113-937,4/5/2016 7:46:56 AM,James H.,Good but not perfect.,3, Cheap for an all-in-one laser printer. Brother makes quality products and you won't get taken for a ride when replacing the toner cartridge. I had another Brother laser printer and the cartridge it came with gave me years of service.ADF is super handy to scan in a stack of bills all at once.," There are a few issues with this model that are annoying. It's a network printer, but for the all-in-one aspect to be used, you have to install the full software package. So that means when you scan stuff in, it targets whichever PC is the master. I'd rather configure it to drop the files in a network share or on an internal FTP, but I haven't figured that out yet. The manual leads me to believe this is possible, but that might be a printer model with a more fully featured firmware. The manual covers multiple printers. The drivers don't even exist as a Windows Update package for Windows 8.1. I had an older Brother printer that just worked, even on Windows 7. This one takes setup work to add it to new laptops. We host exchange students so there tends to be new computers each year. I wouldn't recommend this if you have a lot of traffic.If you use the buttons at the scanner, be prepared to go through the menu and change the options every single time you want to scan. It defaults to 100dpi and there's no way to change the defaults even from the software package. It can scan up to 600dpi. But it won't unless you tell it to each time.If you use the automatic document feeder, be aware that the maximum document length that will actually be scanned is 14 inches. I tried scanning a contract that was 17 inches long and the last 3 inches of it was cut off when I viewed the file on my computer. I had to fall back to an old Chinese wand scanner that this was meant to replace. The ADF should be able to handle a document of any length and it is super annoying that this is even an issue.Brother: if you are reading this, these are all items that you should fix with a firmware update.", This is something I knew going into this purchase but the scanner does not duplex scan. If you need both sides then you have to flip the document over and scan the back side as well. Really consider if you might want duplex scan. You might actually want the more expensive one with it.,4,8

A deep scratch can make lines too. When the feeder is being used in a scan operation, the scanning head is parked.

It took approximately forever to scan anything through the Automatic Document Feeder and it would fail roughly half of the time. Of course, the scanning software would destroy your work and force you to start over. It once took me close to 45 minutes to scan 10 or 15 sheets this way. Completely unacceptable.The Ethernet port or NIC on the printer was extremely flakey since day one. I don't know if I got a bad model nor did I want to deal with HP's amazingly awful support to explore options, but it would be reachable and remain on the network until the moment you sent it a print job of any size. It would complete the job or even let you run another one if it was feeling generous and then become randomly unreachable until it was hard-rebooted. This made remote scanning LOTS of fun.The fax machine never worked for me. I have one line in my apartment and wanted the printer's fax machine to share it with my phone and voicemail. Most printers let you do this. This is not an uncommon scenario. It was impossible to set this up with any permutation of the settings available to me. For what its worth, I was able to set up faxing on my new Brother 7360N in all of ten minutes, testing included. To top all of this off, it randomly decided to put itself in a hard reboot loop. All it would display on the screen was ""No strings in RO;"" this apparently meant it was due in for a firmware upgrade, but the unit kept resetting itself during the flashing procedure, so I don't think that was the cause of this."," Surprisingly, I bought several M1536DNF's for the company I work for and they all work amazingly.

One would think that with all the functions this unit has that it would have the ability to forward an incoming fax to email - but no, we're just stuck with faded printed faxes that are essentially worthless.

For a home office setup,  19ppm and the first page actually a full second faster than the advertised speed of 8.5 seconds,  is worthwhile.  8000 pages a month duty cycle is more than most users will ever need,  just ensuring that all will be well when it is crunch time. Copying is a breeze.  Honestly I'm a bit surprised at the speed you can make all 99 copies in one sitting.  Same as printing,  even with the initial scan. Faxing is..  Well faxing.  33.6 modem speeds are all you need.  The number memory is flawless in execution.  But most of all,  initial fax tests I've run (20 pages,  text and images,  and single pages of both as well)  went amazingly well.  Every line was straight,  no paper jams,  and no loss of focus on the entire transmission. Tested the connectivity as well.  Both Ethernet and USB 2.0 were flawless when using a Cisco EA4500 router."," I two gripes with it.  The first is quite minor. The cheap LED control panel.  Specifically the way it rocks back and forth.  I keep it  extended.  I just wish it was stationary at that angle,  it would feel as if it were higher quality that way.  The control panel itself is easy to use and even easier to understand,  which makes the overall gripe moot. The other,  I have not seen where you can purchase paper stock extenders for this.  Not a big deal,  but for a home office unit necessary.  If you have pets,  that is.  Two words,  Pet Dander."," If you do not have pets,  I'd say this is the printer for you.  If,  like me,  you keep the pets out of your home office,  that works too. On average,  the toner cartridges are $20.00 cheaper than its wireless counterpart,  the Laserjet Pro m1217nfw.

Also great for sharing use of it to all other computers in the home.  The speed is really quite excellent.  It will spool the data via LAN very quickly and start printing almost immediately.

It has been probably the most unfriendly MultiFunction machine I have ever used. There are many, many layers of menus just to change the paper type from printing on plain paper to labels (no, it does not do this automatically as most printers do!)Another shortcoming is the ability to effectively use the fax along with your answering machine or phone. The fax picks up and attempts to receive in the middle of calls or when a caller is leaving a voice message. We have tried every conceivable configuration and even worked with Canon support to try to resolve this issue.  It has been months and it is still not working.  My older HP multifunction printer which this Canon is replacing handled phone/answering machine/fax switching perfectly for many years.

Tons of options, approaching professional level integration. The print and scan functions are relatively fast for my home level usage, so that's a plus. Quality of prints and scans is perfect for what I need, especially considering the low price tag. It even synchronizes with my NTP server and even has SNMP for integration with my PRTG Network Monitoring software. Setup was extremely easy from the Remote UI configuration page. I initially set it up via the LCD on the printer with my wireless access point. Having my networked computers connect to the printer was simple and I was printing in minutes.I looked at some generic toner replacements, and since this printer uses a fairly common toner cartridge, they are very affordable with good reviews."," None found yet. Some of the plastic doors seem a little cheap, but I haven't seen many printers that are much better, even in the workplace where we spend thousands on laser printers."," This color laser printer replaced my Konica Minolta Magicolor 2400w, so a multifunction color laser is quite an improvement. It does take up a slightly larger footprint on my desk, but that is expected. Build quality seems decent, so time will tell if it can last long. I take good care of my computer related components, so I don't see any problems cropping up.",None,None

(Energy saver mode combined with inexpensive Laser Printer)Cost of Toner - Name a unit that isn't an issue for...Connectivity was an issue early. Once we figured that out it's been smooth sailing., I have deployed 4 here over a year ago. Only complaint from users has been speed sometimes. We have $1500 units that give us more problems.Bottom Line is this is a sub-$200 multi-function network-able color laser printer. Maybe let that sink in? Right now a mere $30 more than the equivalent black and white. Cartridge cost is relative. When have you ever bought an ink jet that the cartridges didn't cost nearly as much as the printer or more and provide a fraction of the page volume the laser cartridges do? This is not a perfect printer but for the price what do you expect? Ours have been great reliability wise and only had jamming issues when there was moisture in the paper.

In that mode, you can print from it, but you can go into settings and increase the time before going into sleep mode.IF IN SLEEP MODE AND YOU WANT TO SCAN, JUST PRESS THE ENERGY SAVER BUTTON, SCAN BUTTON, ARROW DOWN FOR REMOTE COMPUTER AND OKAY BUTTON AND READY TO GO.  TAKES 4 SECONDS.Software works well and toner cartridges easy to replace.Is color perfect? No, but at this price, it is very acceptable and will pass almost all but the most descerning eyes.There is no better multifunction value on the market today and if you are tired of clogged print heads, get this!I have two units, but working great for almost 1 year now.",3,4

The unit is unusable for anything but printing from a computer after the screen shuts down. I cannot scan or make copies. The unit will not power off and the buttons are unresponsive. In order to then use any of the feature, most importantly for me make copies, I have to unplug the unit from the wall and wait 10 seconds or so.

No issues.Very quick first print.  Made probably 20 color fliers in roughly 2 minutes for a car that I was selling.Build quality seems a little on the light side.

Bought glossy version instead, worked fine.As others have said, your mileage may vary on the starter toner.  Already burned half-way through mine as it sits.

I have gotten all the features to work properly and seamlessly. The drivers and software are not gimmicks. They actually work as advertised from Brother. ink is very cheap. All fax/scan/copy etc works at high resolution. This unit is very quiet, much quitter than my ink jet its very space saving too. I'm very happy I purchased this unit."," Doesn't support AirPrint like Hp, Brother offers their own app which also works great, but it doesn't allow me to print e-mails and anything else on apps. Its has its own interface, not much of an issue as I use my mac book pro which works flawless via time capsule.The lcd screen also has an issue where if your right above it, you won't be able to see the lines, this is an easy fix as I just made it the brightess it goes up to however you still have to view at an angle to see the whole contrast lettering.I purchased this knowing that AirPrint from my iPhone and iPad wouldn't work. I also purchased this knowing ink will be way cheaper, and with a lot more quality printer/interface, etc. The resolution is much better. The price was also $100 cheaper than HP. This is why I chose the brother and am very glad I did. If you absolutely must use AirPrint and cannot use the brother app than choose hp otherwise you will have quality or quantity with this unit."," only downfall is AirPrint unsupported, brother provides app for apple devices i.e. iPad, iPhone, touch, etc... While the app works, it only prints from internet, photos, clipboards and scans directly to the device. While AirPrint is actually better, this is definitely an alternative. Of course AirPrint is better, but for my needs, I chose the quality the printer offers much more standards than the hp. The AirPrint was definitely not worth the sacrifice as I still can print wirelessly from my macbook pro. This printer contacted to my apple time capsule easily via wirelessly.

After repaired, it worked another 30 days.  Beautiful when it worked, but I expected more than four months."," I purchased this printer in September of 2013 and it ran fine for about three months.  On average, I print about 30 pages including both color and B/W prints.  It stopped printing in November of 2013 because there was a problem with the blue toner.  I could not even print B/W until it was resolved.  The Xerox technician came out and replaced a part and told me that this particular part was prone to go bad so I should expect to have to replace it again in a few months.  It ran flawlessly for about 30 days.  In December of 2013 it stopped again with the same problem with blue toner.  I put it aside and ordered a new, non-Xerox printer.  In April of 2014 I needed to print a few hundred B/W pages so I got the Xerox 6500DN out to try to print B/W.  It was an effort to try to save some of the cost of the printer and toner I had invested in it.  It printed successfully for about three hundred pages.  The black ink began printing very light, but the change toner indicator never showed up.  I changed the toner anyway.  The printer still prints very, very light.  In short, this printer was used for less than six months and was a total waste of money.  I strongly recommend you not buy it unless you simply enjoy frustration and throwing your money away.",,2,2

I work from home and have 3 kids in HS and College printing to this.  Ink Jet printers always dry out when unused for a week or so and always when you need them most.  Never once have I failed to be able to print with this HP.I have used at least 1 cartridge of generic toner from a major printer supplier website for each color without any issues. * I do perform regular maintenance*.  Laser printers generate a lot of dust that needs to be cleaned out.  Use of super cheap and thin big retailer store paper does dirty things much faster.  Maintenance includes updating printer drivers when installed and quarterly thereafter.  It's only common sense.I connected a Netgear Universal WiFi adapter to make this wireless.  This works great.  The printer is on a cart with wheels and moved around the house as needed.  In my research before purchasing, this printer appears to be sensitive to dirty power and voltage sags and spikes.  For this reason, mine has been plugged into a spare UPS/Battery backup since day 1.  If you do this do NOT share a ups with a printer and computer.", A Built-in WIFI should have only added $20 to the cost to build so why not include it?  I wish the duplex option was available from places like Newegg.  Direct from Xerox it's insanely expensive (almost as much as the printer was)., I can see this printer can be worn out if too much printing is done on a regular basis so pay attention to the usage recommendations if considering for a small office.  This is a laser printer with a robust (and therefore complex) set of menu choices and driver types.  It greatly helps if you are a techie type of person or have ready access to one if you are using this at home.,4,4

The sales price $199 seems very inexpensive for such a substantial machine. Make no mistake this is a network enabled, networked printer with  a 10/100/1000 Ethernet port. It comes with a USB port but no built-in bluetooth or wireless. It boots up and searches for a DHCP address, or you have to input one in from the control panel and then power off and power on. You can put it on your network and print from multiple PCs. It comes with Adobe Postscript 3 native, no emulation, it has a few built-in fonts or can download them if you install more memory. More memory turns on features that are turned off in the base model. The ability to download more fonts to it. The ability to print and hold documents in memory to be released at the printer control panel. The ability to ""Collate"" or print multiple copies ""completely sequentially"" instead of three copies of page 1, then three copies of page 2 - then you have to sort and interleave to create three documents (that's what Collation is). It has one paper tray, but you can add another one to increase paper capacity from 250 sheets to 500 sheets. The base model does not come with a Duplexer, but you can buy one and install it. A Duplexer prints automatically on both sides of a sheet of paper before putting it in the output tray. Without it you have to re-insert the paper back into the paper tray yourself to print on the other side. The Base model does not come with a Duplexer. Xerox print drivers are straight forward, they do not layer frameworks or add-ons, or ""ads and special offers"", so they are less likely to break and easier to update. The Xerox drivers are updated and periodically released at the same Xerox website as for the Big Xerox printers. This printer seems to have most of the capabilities as the Big printers just reduced or sized appropriate for the consumer. Price appears to be kept down by making many things ""optional"" but available for a later purchase. Printing and Copying is Xerox's primary business, so I'm looking forward to a printer designed by a printer company to be used as a printer, not as an after thought or add-on.This is the ""middle tier"" printer between the small ""but dump"" budget printer for the desktop and the ""top tier"" printer which has the absolute highest resolution and tries to compete with the Photographic quality Inkjets in a Laser Jet format. Technically its a 600x600 resolution, but with a high degree of gray scale levels and blendable color pallete.

They're not super high quality pictures of people or anything, but 600 dpi just doesn't cut it... and it's cheaper than doing these with an inkjet to get the resolution I need. 3) First page prints out in like 5 seconds.

If you were only getting one of these, that wouldn't even be a problem.The printer configuration was a little odd: once you set up the printer, you downloaded the driver and the driver was sort of customized for each specific printer.

Once installed it's fine but the install file is malformed and poorly rendered.   i got installed by dumb luck.," i'm happy with the purchase of this printer.   I am used to enterprise class printers and this definitely is a notch or two below those.The trick to this printer is to install it on one PC with the USB cable connected when prompted.   It will walk you through the configuration and have you un-plug the cable once wireless is configured.   Once you get through all this it just works.For the Windows clients you can browse to the printer's web interface to install the driver / utility.The ePrint isn't as elegant as I expect Airprint is but it works.   Basically you e-mail whatever file you want to print to a custom e-mail address and your printer will get the print job from the internet all on it's own.   This allows you to print from any device that can send an e-mail attachment.  It also means you can print a form to home from work etc.   Pretty cool.The other big plus is there is virtually ZERO warm-up time with this printer.   It starts printing almost immediately from when you hit print, even if it is in a sleep state.  No more waiting while the printer warms the fuser.This is a great choice for a small Office / Home Office environment, especially if you need the wireless connectivity.The only feature I disabled is direct print and this is just because I didn't feel the need to have an open AP running from the printer for people to directly connect and print to the printer.

Even though i uninstalled my hp 1200 drivers before installing the new ones there was still various dlls left in that somehow caused this printer to be detected as a dvd drive??, then after i uninstalled the new printers drivers.. it oddly didn't uninstall anything so i had to manually go through the registry and remove all hp dlls from the print spooler registry section (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors), delete all the new printers registry entries (various services), delete the 'C:\program files\hp' files delete the installed printer HP dlls in the windows drivers print spooler location (Windows\System32\spool\drivers\w32x86) delete all the HP printer dlls from system32, all just to get this printer to work through USB, (i'm certain it would've worked flawlessly through wireless but i prefer wired hence why i only took off one star), hopefully this was just a freak occurrence but just in case you have a previous model laserjet running on a USB it may have similar problems getting it going [directories and locations are for 32bit windows i wouldn't recommend trying any of that without knowing exactly what you're doing]."," HP laserjet printers are usually the best bet for people who print alot and don't need color, my older 1200 series lasted around 10 years and i ran it to its death, it went hilariously though at first it had a high pitched scream as it printed, then it started printing in wavy lines, now it just farts when you press the power button. I bought this to replace it and it works great so far, wonder if it can last longer than my old one.A slight issue that has nothing to do with the printer but more with neweggs shippers: Theres a current 30$ rebate going on with the purchase of an HP toner cartridge, neweggs shipper's ship the printer by slapping a UPS label on the printer box and shipping it, which isnt normally an issue, but they happened to slap the UPS label >on my UPC code< (required for rebate) i literally spent 2 hrs to carefully not damage the UPC peeling the UPS label off hopefully HP still acknowledges it when i mail it in.",1,1

My Windows 8.1 install is five days old, and neither this printer nor the 8.1 machine blinked during this install.Because the printing needs this printer will support are basic ones, I passed on the printer's prompt to download and install HP's XPS (XML paper specification driver).Because I specifically wanted a wired connection for this printer, I tested the wireless features only briefly, and successfully installed it wirelessly (both via a router-enabled connection to a non-wireless capable desktop AND via a peer-to-peer wireless connection that required no assistance from a router).All in all, this printer offers a tremendous amount of features at a very affordable price.Select with confidence.",3,3

Initial setup was straight forward - jut follow the prompts after you connect the printer (USB cable for setup only).  See other thoughts for setup issues."," Be ware of security issues with this printer, by default it is set for the easiest access .. which means its open for anyone in wifi range to access until you secure it (see other thoughts)"," After install the printer shows up in your wifi network list with - no password, and no way to set one.  Anyone in wifi range can print to your printer - whatever they wish to print to your printer - so beware.  Once you are setup, let it download and install the firmware update (always use the most recent firmware).  then launch the browser page interface (Windows devices and printers>find your printer and right click> select properties>Web links tab and click the webpage link) Once you are into the printers web page interface click  networking then click password and set a network password to prevent anyone from getting to the config page for your printer. (note this only sets a password for administration access to your printers config - not your printers network access)  Next select the wireless direct setup link and disable it.  This will stop your unsecured printer from showing up in the wifi network list when devices look for a network connection.  now only computers , phones, and other devices on YOUR wireless network can print to the new printer.   the last step for me was to enable Google cloud Print  so my chrome Book could print to it - that took a few steps but the webpages walk ya through it.

9SIA9JJ48C0720,28-415-535,7/24/2013 6:19:33 AM,Mr. A.,Too easy for some?,4," In my case, this was REALLY inexpensive. I bought it for less than $10 from someone who supposedly couldn't figure out how to install it, and had already bought something else. But even at its Newegg price, it's a nice deal. It's extremely easy to set up - easiest of any printer I've installed in the past few years. This makes me wonder whether those reporting problems are making the task too complicated.I installed on a home network of four desktops and three laptops running Windows 7, XP and Linux. I did the initial setup using my one XP laptop. All this really consists of is assigning the printer to a wireless access point. Once the printer connects to the network, you disconnect the USB cable. The Windows drivers are stored in the printer's permanent memory, and install automatically via Wi-Fi. For the other Windows computers, the drivers also install from the printer's memory, just by pointing a browser to the IP of the printer, and clicking the HP Smart Install tab. I see from research that HP supplies a CD with the printer, but I didn't get that from the prior owner. The mystery is why that CD is shipped at all. I'm guessing it's stocked with useless promo software, since the owner's manual clearly indicates that it's not needed for installing the printer. Once installed, the printer is quite quick, and it's silent between uses. I also have a more costly HP laser printer that drives me crazy with the noises of its automatic maintenance tasks. That one takes a while to get started, while the P1102w pumps out the first page or two before I can swivel my chair over to where it's sitting. I think the 19ppm estimate may actually be a bit low. Print quality, at least with what is left of the HP 85A cartridge, has been excellent. A bit better than the more costly printer, in fact.Durability - I've only had this unit for about a month, but one of the secretaries at my work has been using an P1102w for over a year now, putting out several thousand pages a month. She goes through a toner cartridge weekly, at least. I don't think this unit is marketed for that kind of abuse, but it's enduring it. That's the real reason a jumped when this was offered to me by its frustrated prior owner."," Genuine cartridges are expensive, and are rated for only 1600 pages. Also, the printer is so lightweight that it's affected by Mr. Newton's equal-but-opposite reaction when using 24-lb paper. It would benefit from being a bit heavier."," I see that others have reported setup to be tricky, which utterly confounds me. I have to wonder whether they overlooked the clear statements in the manual (which I downloaded from HP) that the CD is not needed or used for installing the drivers. I did read the manual, and I can see how someone who doesn't could make the setup much more complicated than it actually needs to be.Because I wanted the printer to have a static IP address for my Linux machines, I assigned it one, and that also does make it a bit simpler to install on the Windows systems. Just to find out, though, I also tested with the printer getting its IP via DHCP, and it worked just fine for the Windows systems.",1,2
9SIA9JJ48C0720,28-415-535,5/23/2013 5:14:39 PM,Gift R.,Relatively problem free,4," The printer installed easily enough, considering the reputation of wireless printers being a bear to install. Under windows 8, the smart install wizard made the process relatively pain free. After plugging in and turning on the printer, and connecting the usb cable, the smart installer showed up in ""Computer"" and I was able to start the installer from there. After accepting license terms and some files were copied/extracted, the installer asks to choose wired or wireless installation. I chose wireless, and the installer asks a couple of questions about manual or automatic connection (I went with manual) and then asks about which network to use nearby. I chose our network, put in the key when asked, and then the installer pre-installed the drivers and then handed over the install to the OS after being asked to unplug the usb cable. After that the installer advertised hp-eprint which I declined, and the installation was done. Windows 7 was connected next from a second computer, which was also very easy in that I downloaded the host-based (smaller footprint) driver and extracted the compressed file(see cons) and was able to choose the printer which was found by windows automatically on the network.On a third computer I installed the printer with Kubuntu by going to settings-->System Settings and choosing printers under hardware. From there I tried to install an hp-cups driver which failed to print a test page. After cancelling the print job, power cycling the printer and deleting the installed printer, I installed the printer manually using the ip address and a foomatic print driver for this model printer."," I did do a firmware update, and was only successful after plugging in the usb cable again and changing the port for the printer to usb. The firmware update would not install over the wireless. Also, when I tried to install in Windows 7 with the host-based driver it initially asked me to plug the printer in through usb; I declined and had to extract the driver manually and point the windows 7 printer installer to the resulting folder manually."," With some previous experience installing printers, this was an easy install.",None,None
9SIA9JJ48C0720,28-415-535,3/27/2013 7:08:23 AM,Stephen W.,Great desktop printer,5," This printer is the successor to the venerable HP LaserJet 1020.  It uses the same paper transport assembly which means IT IS RELIABLE.  We've been using this family of printers for six or seven years.  This latest model adds WiFi print capability and self-contained drivers.  The Direct Print feature is untested, but looks like a win for smartphone users.  (Can print directly from smartphone to the P1102w.)  Installation is effortless as the drivers are burned into ROM on the printer.  When you connect the USB cable, a 'USB drive"" shows up and drivers load automatically.Some sales outlets indicate that this printer does not support duplex printing.  That is not correct.  DUPLEX PRINTING IS SUPPORTED, but it is a two-step process.  I use it quite a bit for user manuals, etc.  You set Printer Properties for manual duplex and hit Print.  The first side is printed, a pop-up tells you to pull the paper out of the delivery tray and load into the paper tray, then the second side prints.  NEVER had a jam in many, many duplex dox.The most wonderful feature of this printer is that it is absolutely unremarkable.  It prints FINE and LASTS FOREVER.  This printer is part of our standard workstation set up for each of our office workers."," Over the years we have lost a couple of HP LaserJet 1020's to labels.  When printing labels, they would [rarely] stick to the drum or toner cartridge or some internal roller.  This basically kills the printer.  It is extremely rare, but when it happens, the printers are virtually impossible to take apart."," Lower-end HP products are nothing like this unit.  This is a robust, reliable, trustworthy partner to offer your employees.  Fast enough, clean print, and good quality renderings.",7,8

The real tricky part is when you go to install it. Read below"," Installing this printer can be very frustrating. If you pick the wireless install, it won't work - period. Yes, it does prompt you for the cd and it does install the software, and locates you wireless network. But, it still did not print the test page.

About a month ago, it started jamming, although opening the rear cover allowed it to print and output onto the floor.When I finally had a chance to check the problem out, there was a 2"" strip of blue tape, like that used to secure the parts for shipping.

Would I buy it again?  Definitely not.   So far, I've used the paper to print about 30 pages or so.Installation: Connecting the printer and turning it on caused my UPS power supply to trip.   I reconnected my previous printer and it worked fine on that UPS.  So, I ended up buying a new UPS (850 VA) and it even tripped so I ended up using both UPS's and splitting my devices in a manner so it doesn't trip anymore.   This Brother printer must draw lots of power when powering up.   The extra UPS was an extra expense that I wasn't expecting.The duplex is useless.   It failed on the first attempt and hasn't worked ever.   It constantly jams and is unusable.   I suppose for the price I paid I shouldn't expect much so I'm just going to use the printer in non-duplex mode.   I wish they wouldn't have even advertised duplex mode rather than implement one so poorly. The accompanying control software seems a bit clunky (icons poor, not well organized GUI) but it works fine.  It just seems to lack the polish of some others that I have used.Frequently the output tray seems to eject paper at an angle rather than in a straight path so I won't be printing more than a few pages at a time without checking it.All in all, I'd probably return the printer if it weren't for the shipping costs.

The Kodak ink is said to have cheaper ink.  Cheaper than what, gold?  The Epson ribbons are like $5-$6 so no complaints there...Just speed, it is slow.So I've compared all of the Laser printers and my friend bought a Canon D420 scanner/printer for $70 here at Newegg on clearance sale but it won't scan in Linux...he don't mind.Well, the 2280DW scans & prints great in Linux, all wireless.  I never used the disk or anything.  There are four files to download and instructions on the Brother site.  It looks confusing but remember...you only need .deb or .rpm files.The files you need for a rpm based distribution are:brscan-skey-0.2.4-0.x86_64.rpmbrscan4-0.4.1-3.x86_64.rpmcupswrapperHL2280DW-2.0.4-2.i386.rpmhl2280dwlpr-2.1.0-1.i386.rpmThey are all on the Brother site, and you need Scanner drivers for brscan4 models.I downloaded the files to a folder called 2280dw.  Highlight all four files, right click and open with software installer.  Make sure all four stay highlighted, when I right clicked it wanted to uncheck that one.Open a console and Switch to root user:Add network scanner entry like this:[root@localhost]# brsaneconfig4 -a name=SCANNER model=2280DW    ip=10.0.0.50 Confirm network scanner entry like this:[root@localhost]#  brsaneconfig4 -q | grep SCANNER  0 SCANNER             ""2280DW""            I:10.0.0.50I'm running Mageia 2 and this device has finally made me Windows free!  I used the menus on the printer and ran the Wlan wizard (in the printer) and it connected with WPA2 AES.  I then logged into the router and locked the IP address by entering the printer MAC address so the printer always gets assigned 10.0.0.50.In Mageia go to Tools/System Tools>Printing...then add printer...it detects it and recommends an Epson driver.  Select Brother, hit next, and then select the driver you installed, it is on the list, and away you go, printing.For scanning follow the instructions and use the IP address you locked it to in the commands(my commands above use the address I put in the router).   Install xsane and the xsane GIMP plug-in and you're set.You can go to  10.0.0.50 (the address you set in the router) in Chrome and use the web interface to configure the printer from there.  You may not have to lock the IP address but I like to know where stuff is.The Brother site really makes it look complicated and it isn't at all.For Windows just use the disk.Windows Free at last!!!You do need cups and the regular printing stuff installed...so if you have some kind of printer you probably have those installed already.", Wish I'd have bought it around Black Friday when it was $100.," You don't need a wifi card in your computer.  Plug your computer into the Wifi router and there you go...if you are on the network through any means then you can use the print and scan features.  People think you need wifi in your computer...you don't.One of the other reviewers said scanning is slow compared to his work scanner.

You have to look at it at just the right light to see what is on the screen- 802.11g only - its the only g-only device on my network so when it kicks in everything slows down...

It should have labelled as WEP only," To get around WEP only, I used ethernet hardwired into a wifi router and encrypted between laptop and wifi router and no encryption between the router and the printer.  The alternative is to downgrade wifi router to WEP in order to have HL-2280DW to join the WiFi subnet and compromise all WiFi communication.  Maybe I am wrong about WEP only, but I could not find option of WPA in the machine or the pdf manual, or the web interface configuration of the printer.

The duplex (two sided) printing feature saves me a whole bunch of headaches, and it doesn't appear to curl the paper anywhere near like my old one did."," 1) As soon as you send a print job to the printer, there is a very noticeable and awkward clicking noise as the drum gets charged.2) Entering a 26 character 128 bit WEP key is a nightmare, the LCD screen is not large enough to display all the characters. Each character is selected by pressing either the up or down arrow and working through a sequence of characters until you get to the one you want. The character on the display is then instantly changed to an asterisk. When you reach the edge of the screen, the input does not scroll, and you are given no visual indication of what you are inputting. Only by counting my keypresses was I able to get my WEP key entered. This is the sole reason why I minused one egg.3)The ""driver/ software suite"" installation is overkill. A simple driver installation with optional software install would've been much more appreciated."," I havent tried using the scanner yet, so I cant comment on that.",2,2

Scanning is actually so straightforward I had problems with it the first time because I tried to overcomplicate the process.," You *must* install their software to use the scanner.  Their software makes the scanning *really* simple, but it sits in your system tray and throws up ads about once a week.  Those ads continue to pop up until you respond to them by selecting a tiny ""never show this again"" link on the ad, that is only available after the second time the ad shows up.

Can't speak to the longevity/durability of it yet, but it was a breeze to set up wirelessly.  1. plug in.2. use printer buttons to set manual IP address, enable Wireless, search for/connect to network, and enter auth code.  On connection it prints a network stat page as confirmation.  Easy = <5 minutes.  There are other ways to do it (web config, driver install, etc), but this was most convenient for me.Copier mode is quick and easy, prints out nice and clean.  I always use compatible supplies after the originals, and rarely have problems with 7 other other brother units in building.  expect same with this one."," Was hoping that I could scan to email or scan to ftp - but that's not the case :( Guess I didn't read description well enough.  Not a huge deal though - just need to connect to a computer by USB for scanning.Noise mentioned and not mentioned by other posts) during printing is substantial if the printer is on your desk, or in your cubicle.  But, if you put a cubicle wall or a bit of space between you and the printer, it won't be too noticeable."," I'm very tempted to buy one for my home.  Only thing that's stopping me is if I want to get a color printer or not.  If i go black and white though, I'll probably be getting this unit.  great for price.",1,1

Keep in mind that this is not a color printer, but rather monochrome (black and white only).  It's absolutely great for my purposes.  I'm currently using the wireless networking feature to connect it to my home network.  I was able to configure this from the printer's built in menus (although it was slightly painful to use arrow keys to enter my WPA2 passkey).  I consider it a big plus to be able to do this and not have to configure it with the included CD."," Brother's ControlCenter4 software is REQUIRED for scanning functionality.  If you just install the drivers you will be able to print, but I still haven't found a way to use the scanner without ControlCenter4.  This isn't a huge con, as the software is not terrible.  No eggs off for this."," For personal and small business use, you really can't beat this product.  It's not overwhelmingly large or noisy.  The wireless networking works wonderfully for both printing and scanning functionality.  For those of you using this as a network printer, keep in mind that you can configure some settings through your web browser using the printer's IP and port 80 as the URL (e.g. 192.198.1.101:80).  This will allow you to turn on toner saver mode among other features.  The default username/password is admin/access.

I am using Windows 7 on all the computers, some x86 and some x64. I have used all 3 functions, and everything works great. I like the ability to feed in thicker paper in the front- great for printing resumes. The online configuration and status utility is pretty nice, and easy way to check and see how many pages I have printed and when I'll need more toner. I think the biggest thing for me is having a network printer that just works. I have had cheaper ones, and they just aren't worth it. They'll stop connecting after a time, or be a pain to setup. This one is really simple- Add printer, add network printer, insert cd, install driver in device manager from cd."," To scan, you need to install their software. I thought I was going to be able to get away with just pulling the driver off the cd and manually inserting it in device manager. That works fine if you just need to print, but to scan I couldn't figure out how to avoid using the Brother suite. Its not a bad suite, but I would rather not have to use it. A function where I could scan to my NAS or to a specific IP, or even send via email would be nice. I guess I am spoiled by the $2K+ printers I used to use at work."," Overall, its a really nice printer. I was able to get it much cheaper than list price (50%), so possibly that is why I find no faults. Even at $200 though, I would probably still buy it. It has been rock solid reliable, and all the features are really easy to use.",3,3

Features everything I wanted in a printer: Laser, monochrome, ethernet host, duplex printing, and a scanner/copier. Print quality is what I would expect and so far I haven't had any issues with jamming or errors. Driver installation was fast and easy with the disc (I am running Windows 7 x64)."," EXTREMELY loud when it starts up and prints. Scared the bejeezus out of my buddy that was standing next to it when I sent a print job from the next room over! However, it is dead silent when it is asleep.Windows 7 does not recognize the printer automatically, you need to install the drivers with a disc and it is larger than 200MB. This may not be a problem for most people but I'm using a small SSD in my computer and I need every little bit of space that I can get."," It's worth noting that this model of printer actually has the toner cartridge separate from the drum. I personally consider this a pro; this makes for cheaper toner cartridges (around $40) BUT every 3 cartridges or so you will have to replace the drum (around $100) to retain good print quality. I personally like this better rather than being forced to replace a drum that still has some life in it when the toner runs out.Also I didn't bother to try the wireless function for this printer, I have always had problems with wireless printers. Better to use a powerline networking adapter and use the ethernet port!",4,4

Works great so far, wakes up fast from sleep and the print quality looks great.   Wireless setup was easy for me, I did it all from the printer.   Works wirelessly with both Mac OSX Lion and Windows 7."," 1.  I do wish there was the ability to easily scan multiple pages into one file (like the other reviewer) but maybe I haven't tried hard enough yet.2.  Brother's free app for the Ipad for some reason does not support this printer, so I had to buy another app to be able to print.  While that worked, it was annoying - why go through the work to put out an app that doesn't support all of your printers?3.  The wireless printer driver setup for the Mac was less intuitive than Windows 7.  One of the few times I can say it just worked for Windows 7 and say that it didn't for the Mac - it took about 10 minutes of fumbling around before I figured it out.  That probably says more about my Mac abilities than the printer.",,8,8

Took literally three days with tech support, and a new router to get wireless set up. Poor wireless software design and exceptionally poor tech support from Brother. My wait time on 7 to 8 calls probably averaged 15 minutes before speaking with anyone. Low functionality on printer itself. For example, scanning 2 separate sheets of paper into a single PDF file is impossible, and so must combine later with another program. The program for this -- The Presto! package -- that comes with HL2280DW not intuitive or functional."," This was meant to replace old Canon ImageCLASS all-in-one that cannot scan to a Mac. The up front cost on HL2280DW is very low, but expect many, many hassles. The product is not ready for the market, and the tech support is not ready to support it. I regret this purchase and the time spent on it, but having spent many hours getting it set up, I do not expect to be sending it back, unless it gives problems in the next week or so. I strongly recommend against buying this product for at least several months, maybe longer, and wait until it is genuinely ready for consumers. This is simply an inferior product that is not ready for the market. I'm disappointed that Brother has pushed it out there without working the bugs out first.",4,14

I work in an office with huge printers and this printer initiates printing faster than in the office.  The quality is good, duplex works well, and it's pretty quick on multiple pages.  The scanner works well both the flat top and the feeder.  Toner replacements seem to be inexpensive.  The high capacity refill says it is good for 2,600 pages.  Appears to be a good value.", It's big and heavy.  The software works okay.  I find it kind of annoying to use the software but it does the job.  It isn't an intuitive as I fell it should be.  I also noticed once I added more computers to print to this printer that the physical scan buttons on the printer itself stopped working.  I only have the software installed on one computer but previously I could just put something on the scanner and push the scan buttons and it would show up on the computer.  That no longer works so I have to use the computer software to initiate a scan now.To get a clean looking scan it makes a decent sized file that can usually be reduced to 1/5th the size without reducing quality with other programs.  It would be nice if the file sizes would be smaller from the program itself., It's a low/moderate capacity machine suited for a small office or personal machine at home.,None,None

I got it to make quick copies and B/W prints. I have it setup only as a network printer and got both the printer and the scanner working on both Windows and Ubuntu using the software provided on the Brother website.

I ended up changing this to a different circuit that has mainly light, and now just the light flash/flicker. It makes a lot of ""clicking"" noise just as the page is almost done printing.

If your UPS isn't up to handling the cutover, it will drop everything plugged into it; at least that was my experience.  Seriously, my house is relatively modern yet cooling fans slow down, and the lights dim when this dude fires up.

I have a little home office, but don't really print massive things on a regular basis, but there are occasions when I need to print 50 - 100 page docs. This thing prints very quickly.  It's consistent enough to use for business needs, but cheap enough for the regular person.  I've loved all the scanning and copying features.  Worked every time thus far. The toner cartridge is very easy to access and everything is properly documented with little diagrams for people to follow.  A fun feature is that the scanner door has the ability to pop up for larger documents or books if you want to copy a page.  The Color and Black/White scanning works great for all the needs I've had (document, pictures, dog's face)", The toner does run out eventually.," Don't replace the toner when it first asks.

It also prints decently fast. Very simple printer to set up and use.," After a year of use the printer now jams practically after printing every page. Rarely I'm lucky to get off 10-20 consecutive pages to print. It has also started curling the pages a good bit. The manual says that the printer will automatically jam if the paper is curled greater than 2mm (I believe thats what the measurement was), but I don't believe this is the problem because if I print one page the printer will say there is a paper jam after that page prints when there is no paper there. I believe then that the problem is somewhere in the mechanics of what detects a paper jam because when it says there is a jam when no paper is present I have to remove the drum and re-insert, and usually it takes a couple attempts to get the jam message to go away, as if some latch is sticking or something."," There are other reviews here and especially elsewhere with problems of this printer jamming constantly and I've found no where that anyone has been able to fix it. There are also plenty of reviews of no one having trouble.This is a great printer when it works, but know you are taking the risk of it jamming after every page. This was my first Brother printer and I'm very disappointed since I only heard good things about them.",6,7
9SIA0AJ2RS2704,28-113-660,7/27/2013 11:11:15 AM,Dennis K.,Good basic home laser MFC,4," Bought this printer to replace an old Canon MFC that finally ate its own paper feed mechanism after several years. So far it's been great. Setup was dead simple; Brother provides a driver-only install for the printer and scanner drivers, so you don't need to install any bloatware software packages. Installed the driver, plugged in the device, and was scanning and printing all in about two minutes. The entire setup took less time than removing all the shipping tape and inserts.Printing and scanning is plenty fast. Takes just a few seconds to warm up the toner before printing the first page, and to warm up the lamp before scanning. Printing speed is about what you'd expect for the price range, a few seconds per page or so. The duplex printing is a great bonus feature for a low-end MFC. Can't speak for the network connectivity, as I'm just using a direct USB connection right now, but it's also a nice feature to have if I ever want to switch to using it as a network printer in the future."," Just a few minor issues, really: - The LCD is unreadable from anything but straight-on, and the screen is angled quite a bit, so if the printer is on a low shelf or the floor, you have to bend way down to read it.  - The spring holding the scanner bed lid closed is pretty stiff and engages very suddenly when closing it, so it will slam the lid down really hard if you aren't careful. The lid itself is flimsy, but also heavy due to the ADF mechanism, so it's a bit awkward all in all. - The paper feed mechanism does tend to curl the paper a bit, particularly when printing in duplex mode. That's the price you pay for the device's relatively compact size, I guess."," Have to see how this thing holds up over time. Being an inexpensive MFC, I expect the durability is probably limited, but I don't print all that much, so for the price, if it lasts me as many years as my old Canon did, I'll be pleased.",2,2

Scanner and copier works great with no problems.," A few aspects but not major.  One would be that the copier lid is completely pastic and therefore very flimsy.  The spring has a lot of resistance therefore when you close the lid, it will just slam down onto the glass if let down the lid too quickly.  Second thing would be the scanner.  When attempting to scan a stack of ducuments using the upside of the scanner, theres no problem in saving that whole stack of paper as 1 pdf file.  However, when you use the glass top to scan, it can only be saved as 1 page per pdf file.  More of a software issue i guess.  My HP inject uses a glass top scanner but it gives you the option to add more scanned sheets before generating it into a pdf file.  Strange but lets just hope the topside doesnt die."," Overall, its a great printer and got it at a great deal.  Not a very intense printer user as i perfer everything digital unless when I need to read it. In my opinion, if you're a light user like me, the starter toner should last you a pretty long time.

There is nothing you can do to print at that point. You can't wake it up on the printer itself. You can't wake it up from your PC. Your only recourse is to literally uninstall and reinstall the printer every single time you want to use it. Brother has some network repair tool to download to fix it. Too bad it does not. However, the existence of the tool at all shows that they are completely aware of the problem yet they keep making these things. It is even under their FAQ showing that this problem is very prolific.Win7 does not see this as a scanner either. It only will after installing the bloatware - even if you installed the complete driver.Win8 is the same way.Why is it so difficult for companies to make stuff that works these days?Consumers should be able to file lawsuits against companies like this for free or through the SEC.

When the page count reached 400, it warned me to replace the toner. I've kept printing and am at near 1000 pages! It does eventually stop and tell you to replace it, but there is an override option and it just KEEPS printing. I can't wait to see what happens when I drop forty dollars on a replacement toner cartridge that's supposed to print 1200 pages. Everything else about the unit is great, too.

No drivers in any of the Debian repositories I could find, so I had to download them from Brother.  There were very good instructions on the web site, but even a pretty techy guy like me had to follow them very carefully.  The drivers were for 32-bit Debian, and so had to be ""forced"", and a separate package ""lib32stdc++"" had to be installed first.  I guess I've been spoiled by the CUPS ""foomatic"" database which is almost always painless.Once loaded, the test page looked funny, but the printed pages were fine."," Once the Brother drivers make it into the official foomatic database, this printer should be excellent.The web interface was thorough, but not especially intuitive.I had hoped the scanner could eMail an image file, but instead it will place it in a network location, and can also make it a pdf file if you like.",9,11

Now they are making higher-end consumer products.Auto-Document feeder. So far it works great and is extremely fast (and super convenient).Affordable Toner (Even genuine Brother Toner is only $42 here on new egg and thats a normal price, not a sale for 2,500 pages!)Small Footprint - Considering that this is an auto copier too, it is surprisingly space-concous. Its the perfect size for a small office.Networking built in - Brother printers always have great networking support. It isn't wireless, but if you plug it into your desktop computer, change some settings on your computer and it becomes wireless through your computer. You can also plug it into your router and make it wireless too.DUPLEX! You can print double sided automatically! This is a great feature normally only in premium models $$$"," The LCD Screen Sucks. But it DOES have a backlight! You can't be standing over the copier and look straight down, screen washes out and you can't read it. You have to stand back about 2 feet in front of the copier and then look at it.Noise level is average. A lot of people complain that it is loud, and like all lasers, it is much louder than an inkjet. But I have been using lasers for years, and it is about average as far as noise volume is concerned with laser printer. I really don't think there is any other laser printer on this site that would be any quieter. Its just the nature of the technology, there isn't much to do to fix it. So I can't mark it down for that.This printer is extremely light on documentation. I am quite tech savvy and I ran into some problems with installing the drivers for mac. Turns out a reboot did the trick, keep that in mind."," This is a great printer for the money. I use it to make lots of copies, print labels, envelopes, and basic document printing. I print high-volume so laser is ideal. But I don't print photos, mainly documents, text, so monochrome is fine.The auto document feeder comes in handy more often than you think. It doesn't fax, you need the next model up for that, but Id rather email any day over fax.I love the special slot for envelopes and labels. My favorite feature is how you can pull back the back plate and print straight through. Perfect for labels and envelopes and other thicker media. Doesn't bend the paper and doesn't get jammed. Prints straight through.I wish they had thrown an extra $5-$10 into the LCD screen. It is only two lines and the contrast is horrible. You have to crouch down and look at it, at just the right angle or else it gets washed out, even on the highest contrast setting. On the plus side, it is backlit, which is more than a lot of comparable models can say",7,7

From a hardware standpoint this printer is great for home use but the short size does require a smaller toner cartridge which runs out sooner."," No Ethernet or WiFi but you can buy the 2270DW for fifty more if this one is on sale or only ten more if this one is regular price.  My biggest gripe is that Brother's install software is awful and has been since the 1990s.  Back then everybody had lousy install software and the Windows USB drivers flaked out occasionally and needed to be uninstalled and re-installed several times with much cable plugging and unplugging.  These days the drivers are pretty solid once you get them installed but the Brother install software makes that quite a chore; especially if you are putting the printer on a print server.  For that scenario you need to extract the driver software and point to the appropriate inf file buried in the extracted folder structure when you install a standard TCP/IP printer port.  If you want the Brother monitor software on the remote computer you have to run the driver install and cancel when you get to the ""plug in the USB cable"" part.  That usually works but not always so you may have to repeat it a few times.  Make sure the TCP/IP port is set up to use the LPR protocol with the Queue Name set to L1 on the TCP/IP port.  I suspect the incorrect defaults there are due to a Windows screwup.  Even if it looks like it installed correctly you won't know unless you print a test page.  Minus one egg for horrible install software.", Brother makes nice printers that don't cost a lot and seem to function pretty well once you get them set up.  My 1998 vintage Brother is still working but doesn't do duplex printing.  The 5250 DN that this replaced appears to have died of a broken new  toner cartridge sensor but otherwise worked fine.,2,2

I love the double sided printing., Would be nice if it came with a normal toner cartridge.," Between newegg and a couple other sites I referenced before my purchase, there are many complaints about how these Brother printers make you change the toner before it is actually all gone.  I did notice this with the included toner.  Brother makes no effort to hide the manner in which you can bypass the need to change it as soon as the printer says to.  I don't recommend running the toner down too low as it can damage the printer.  I don't know if I am allowed to link outside sources on here, but I found a page that discussed how when the printer in done with a print job there is some toner that falls back into the cartridge.  This small bit of toner has been heated up and can eventually become useless.  If anything it can lead to clogging the printer and damage it.  So by all means bypass the change cartridge message, but I wouldn't recommend it for too long.  Don't milk the toner dry.",1,1

I was fed-up with my 2 HP laser printers that were pretty outdated and not working properly anymore.So I checked newegg and came upon this one refurbished. Since I had a lot of good luck buying refurbs and the price was a quarter below hundred with free shipping, I got interested in this thing. I was reading the specs and what is in the box as well as the feedback here.some low rating was based on the low level of knowledge of the buyer resulting in disappointment not really related to the product.I did read and print out the comments about resetting to use the 3rd party toner that I also ordered right away. I was also reading that the first toner that comes with the printer only prints a few pages.Let me tell you folks, we are consumers and that is what we are supposed to do. They make more money selling USB cables and new toner than selling a printer. It is good old tradition ( I was working in the PC business for ten years) to not put a printer cable in the box and neither ink nor toner that comes with the printer shall last you ! So go and buy that stuff, consume.Educate yourself a little bit so you can lower your expectations!The printer and toner came swiftly. Unpacked printer, setup win7 no problem (because I have a bunch of USB cables, buddy!) first print came out after 3 minutes. I love the small footprint and quick response time and DUPLEX was a must for me since I am printing my own catalogs for my hobby shop.It is correct that the printer does not come with a USB cable to connect it to your pc. It is correct that the toner that comes with the printer only gives you about 50-60 prints . I do not like that either but that is pretty much standard so I cannot give it less eggs for that.The 3rd part Rosewill cartridge that I replaced today worked flawlessly right from the start. No miracle resetting or any other procedure necessary in my case. If it should happen with the next cartridge I do know how to reset since it is here to find in the reviews.And this printer is quiet, too. Not while printing but in sleep mode or after printing.So my old HP printers will be trashed. Like I got rid of Epson ink printers, worst out there and a total rip off.

I've read test sites which say that there isn't that much extra toner used between 300 to 600 DPI, so I leave it set on 600.Contrary to what someone else said, this printer DOES accept generic OEM toner, you just have to RESET the printer when you do it.  There is information out there that can help if you search for it.

The HL-2040 still works fine but I figure it is due since it is several years old and has run many thousands of sheets of paper.  If this one lasts half as long I will be happy.Seems to be very similar to the HL-2040 with just a few exceptions.  The most notable is that the way paper stacks on the top is better.  The HL-2040 was rounded on top and if the paper ""catcher"" was not flipped up it would sometimes push paper off the printer.  This one is more flat and I don't think that will happen.  Also, the paper ""catcher"" on this one does not stick out like the HL-2040.",1,1

However, I believe my older printer outperformed this one especially when it comes to envelope printing.With this HL-2240D, you have to open the rear port and flip a couple of green tabs up in order to print an envelope- unless you want the envelop full of crinkles; my old Brother would print envelopes without this extra work; perhaps this extra work is due to the duplex feature on the 2240D.Other than the PITA for printing envelopes, so far it has printed everything perfectly clear and crisp. I did not install any drivers manually, Windows 7 installed the drivers itself. I did not have any problems printing from Windows 7 64-bit with MS Word 32-bit version- I had seen in other reviews that some people had a problem with this configuration but I did not.The printer is not loud, compared to my old Brother, and yes the fan does continue to run for about five minutes after you've finished printing- sometimes longer depending on how much you've printed. Also, apparently this printer uses less electricity than my previous printer, because the lights do not dim or flicker when it turns on... my other printer used to always cause the lights to flicker.I also noticed that it is automatically set to print at 600 dpi, which IMO is overkill for regular text printing; I set to default of 300 dpi; I only change to 600 dpi if I'm printing graphics.For those complaining about no USB cable; very few printers these days come with a cable; you can pick up a cheap USB cable if your buy them online. I think the reason for this is that the companies figure you already had a USB cable with your old printer- which should use the same cable; this helps them save money and keeps unnecessary cables from ending up in the landfill.",15,17

I can't make it to the other room in time to watch it print anymore :'(Though, I suppose I /do/ sort of wish I had color printing abilities. But that comes at a SERIOUS increase in price. Color laser printers are totally out of this baby's price range."," Even if this printer was double the price, or triple, I'd still buy it. It's THAT worth it to me. I use it for school all the time.

9SIA0AJ3T48865,28-113-587,2/16/2012 1:26:14 PM,DONALD M.,Great no frills lasar printer,5, I got tired of paying out the nose for inkjet cartridges and picked up this one for my college son and the 2270DW for myself. This  is a great buy on a no frills laser printer that prints double sided as well. That saves me a ton of expensive paper these days. I'm getting about 700 copies out of the starter cartridge thus far. I bought a generic toner refill kit for about $10 which are readily available online and easy to refill. All in all I'm very satisfied. It's a little noisy but that's a minor complaint. Heck for $59 onit's cheaper to buy a new printer than get a new OEM Brother toner cartridge or drum. It appears pretty well made and have had no problems at all with it in about 7 months of use. Great alternative to buying over priced inkjet printer cartridges which are such a rip off. You don't have to worry about them drying up or clogging from lack of use either. I'm happy I switched. If you don't need color prints this is the one to buy for general use black and white printing, a bit on the noisy side. Cartridges are expensive but just buy a toner refill kit for cheap. Only USB connection so it must be directly into your computer. You can't network this one with an IP address like the 2270DW I don't believe. It seems it doesn't print as dark as some of the more expensive laser printers but there is an adjustment in the settings for print density that I haven't messed with at all., I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a decent reliable laser printer and at a rock bottom price. Great for college students.,1,1

However, with the tips I gave in that review, you should be able to get through setup fairly easily.Also as I mentioned in that earlier review, the printer does put two very faint vertical creases from top to bottom of each page. But that has not been a problem.And as I mentioned before, the paper curls slightly, but that also has not been a problem."," I've used this printer since I bought it eight months ago and it's been great. I don't do a lot of heavy volume, but it has performed beautifully for everything I've printed. I'm still on the original cartridge. It's a nice compact size.As other reviewers have mentioned, it has a power-saver feature where it turns itself off. This happens after just a minute or two if nothing's printing. But as soon as you send something to print, it wakes up immediately and starts printing. You do not have to turn it back on as one reviewer mentioned. The feature works perfectly. The main reason I bought it was to cut down on the number of ink tanks I had been buying for my color inkjet printer. I figured there was no point in using the inkjet for black and white documents.

We needed an inexpensive but durable laserjet printer for business purposes.  The price was great, installment was easy and it prints quickly enough to make my job so much easier."," Can't think of any.  We own a small business and use the printer mainly for printing invoices, though it does get used quite a bit more often for other purposes.  So far we love it."," Was worried about the maintenance costs of a laserjet printer but the initial toner cartridge has lasted a long time and the replacement cost is fabulous.  Hope I don't sound gushy but if you've gone through as many printers as we have, and has as many jams, etc. during the printing process you'd understand our gushy-ness.",2,2

Minor complaint, not a big deal."," I'm very happy with this printer overall; have only used it with Windows so far. Would have been five stars but it was more trouble prone than expected getting it updated to latest driver and firmware. These are available for download on the HP support site. Recommended order to avoid problems:1. Install printer to print USB, using CD setup package included with the printer.2. Update the driver on the PC.3. Update the printer firmware.4. Update the printer smart-install utility.5. Configure wireless printing using the utility that is automatically installed from the CD.6. Set up additional PCs by pointing browser to the printer's url and downloading the driver.If it will not connect to the wireless network. Reset the wireless settings to factory default as explained in the manual on the CD, and configure again.If you do not need the functions in the latest firmware (e.g. air print, cloud print), it will setup to print from Windows XP just fine out of the box.",2,2

This thing does not stay on more than 2 hours. It always falls asleep. If you want to print something you have to go to the printer and turn it on and then print your stuff. HP Customer service said that even though there is a feature so that the printer never turns off it will always turn off after 2 hours max! So whats the deal? Why is HP selling me a product with a feature that is burned into its firmware and software and yet fails to work ? Sure I could fight HP and stick it to the man but I simply don't have time for that. HP used to be a good product for home and small office but now they truly are losing their touch.I'll go back to brother printers., If you want to use this as a local usb printer it will work ok.,2,5

Printer is marketed as ePrint ready, however the firmware is older and doesn't support it out of the box.

No CD needed to install drivers.Nice web interface., It is a little on the noisy side. It's not like you are going to need ear plugs but you might not want to print if there is a light sleeper in the room.It seems to curl the very top of every page it prints just a little bit., I have had no problem with setting up the wireless.You CAN turn off the auto-off feature from the web interface.You CAN manually set up the wireless so it works. The auto option did not work for me but if you have encryption it will never work. It can't guess your password. You need to manually set up the wireless.When you finish installing the printer and setting up the wireless (from the software included) you can print a test page. On it there will be the IP address of the printer. If you type that in your web browser you can configure your printer over your home network. Manually set a static IP and download drivers from the printer over your network to any computer. It's a great printer.

Auto-off, saves electricity. Reacts instantly, even when coming out of sleep. Super ez setup on an XP home network.

By this I mean, whenever a page prints, something inside the printer ""Clicks"" to grab the paper. However this printer ""Clicks"" much louder that I like, It almost ""clanks"". For this reason, I almost returned it. However I decided the pros outweighed this annoyance. I'm up late at night, so I have to close the door before I print. I just hope this thing doesn't break.The printer comes with a ""starter"" toner cartridge. This is noted on the box it came in, however I didn't see this when I purchased it, I must have missed this fact, I should have read the fine rpint more closely."," I currently own a Laserjet 1012, which still prints beautifully to this very day. the 1012 is quieter, it doesn't warp the paged with heat, and it doesn't crease the paper either. It's disappointing the HP stumbled in these areas, but the price and wireless capability makes it an ok tradeoff. Next time, I am going to spend a little more money, and I see this line of printers are going down in quality and craftsmanship.

Although Rosewill toner price compensates for the relatively subpar number of prints per toner.2)BUYER BEWARE:  YOU CAN'T DISABLE THE AUTO-OFF feature on this printer. This comes directly from  their tech supports mouth. The best you can do is for it to turn off after 2 hours and no longer than that. If you want to print you have to turn off the printer and turn it back on. Which defeats the purpose of accessibility and convenience. What if i live in a 2 story house and its my centralized network printer ? I have to go all the way to the where the printer is and come back down after getting a print error to begin with...its just pathetic., You can buy cheaper or equal priced printers like Brother and Samsung and they will stay on all time and will print fine after sleeping.

Toner is much more expensive than other laser printers. Third party tone maker maybe an idea. If you are a heavy user, then you may want to look at a different model with a bigger toner."," You need windows to install the firmware upgrade.

I spent 6 hours trying to get the software installed and it would not install.  Finally I just used the generic Windows installer that comes up when you plug in a USB cable, and that installed in about a minute.  I did a test print and it worked fine.(2) As one other reviewer mentioned, the printer unfortunately puts two very light creases down the full length of each page (dividing the page into thirds across the page).(3) Also as someone else mentioned, the pages come out slightly curled at the top."," Don't waste your time with the installation CD.  When you run it, it appears to be installing (progress bars, etc.), but it apparently gets hung up in an endless loop because I tried it twice and it ran for 45 minutes the first time and then an hour and a half the second time.  I had to terminate the installation both times.Here's my advice on how to install (USB connection):  If the HP Smart Install program doesn't appear on screen when you connect the USB cable as described in the setup instructions, press the ""wireless"" button on the printer's control panel (the one at the top with the ""radio waves"").  I just happened to press it today when the printer wouldn't print and suddenly HP Smart Install appeared on screen, which I ran and it completed successfully.In spite of all this hassle, this may be a decent printer for my purposes.  I got it to try to cut down on the expense of ink tank replacement on my inkjet printer.  I'll use the laser printer for black and white printout",5,6

Installing was pretty confusing also, I had to look for additional help to get the scanner working."," The printer has a very big problem with paper jams. Even the slightest crease on the paper in the paper tray will make it jam. Also printing large quantities of material will most likely jam it also. Fixing the paper jam for me is so far impossible.

I was able to find many other people having this same issue online, and there is no fix. I feel like it is a good buy for printing, but not for scanning.

Faxes nicely from the computer without having to make a preprinted copy."," Loud, jams more than occasionally, cannot copy book pages easily since no pressure should be placed on the glass plate (you can't flatten the book page for printing). My worst problem is that in either printing or receipt of a fax, if the paper in the machine is not exactly the size the machine expects, the machine will light the error lamp and refuse to do anything else until either the job is deleted from the machine or a larger size paper is added. I have had several faxes come through which are letter in size but for some reason the machine thinks they are legal size. Its a bit of a bother to have to change the paper just to get out an 81/2 x 11 equivalent size page. Too, paper seems a bit tight in the bin. You can get it in but you have to work on it a bit. Not clear to me that I would buy this as a primary printer."," Bought this from Newegg  back in March, 2010. Runs fairly well except for the noise. I have set up an old Laserjet 6p as my primary printer and now use this one primerly for sending/receiving copies and making copies. I find the foot print acceptable. The real problem is with some of the instructions. It took quite a bit of time to figure out how to clear the error message when the fax came in at a somewhat different size or when the article I was trying to print was somewhat larger than the 81/2 x 11 paper that normally sits in the machine. You can either replace the letter size paper with legal or press the system monitor button, direct to the present ""print"" job, and follow the instructions to clear.

This printer is always up to the challenge and blows right through the largest documents my inkjet would have taken half an hour to churn out. Quality is impeccable. Manual feed door IS useful for manual duplexing when required. Windows 7 is pretty good about telling the printer to wait when the user desires to manually duplex with a unit like this. Replacement ink is dirt cheap due to popularity (unlike newer Samsungs) and the starter toner has about double the amount in it of most others."," Curls the pages a bit. Blue light is a little bright sometimes and is always on through the standby mode unless you flip the main power switch off. I'm certain it would ravage an envelope as I read in another review. Then again, I haven't had envelope printing luck in any other printer with any kind of consistency. I had it jam once and it was easy to clear, the error was my fault due to the fact I cancelled the print half way through. No negative aspects are worth taking off an egg."," I had a Samsung ML-2510 as a home unit separately from this Brother. The Samsung petered out, which I attribute to the design flaws of exposing the paper tray to pick up misc items (piece of cat food.... I think. grr.) and the fact that clearing a jam deep within of a small item is impossible because there is virtually no way to access it.

The scanner function seems to work fairly well, but if you need a good result you will need a dedicated scanner too."," When a paper jam occurs it is very difficult to remove the jammed paper.  You cannot remove enough of the interior etc in the way to get to the paper out.  If you can grab an end the paper the rollers resist letting you pull the paper out so that you often only get fragments.  Then the pieces left in the printer cause continuous jamming. In addition the printer is very noisy when printing.  The output tray is poorly designed, so if you don't constantly run over to remove the printout it causes the following paper to roll up into little scrolls.  They do look interesting, but seem to lack that presentation look."," Cannon technical support is non existent.  If you do call them be sure you are in a very amiable mood, because before you are done you will be in an awful mood.

I also picked up one for work after the deal. • All in one black and white laser for price of a cheap inkjet. • Newegg has aftermarket cartridges at a good price.• Fairly Speed especially for the price.• Great print quality., • Manufacturing quality seems iffy. First one is great but the front cover does not latch and stay closed. Ended up using tape to keep it closed. • It is cheaply built.," I don't know how long it is going to last, but for low quantity printers it is great. I only use the copy and printer portions. I have not used the scanner or fax. I gave it a shot because it was made by Canon, was cheap and has cheap cartridges. It exceeded my expectations.It really does print great, the only thing that made me not give it 5 eggs is the construction quality is definitely lacking. However for the price I don't see how you could go wrong. Normally I would buy only THE brand of printers whose name I can not mention here but Canon has made OK lasers so I gave this one a shot.

When I plugged my new HL-2140 into the USB, the OS immediately found the printer and set it automatically set-up with the foomatic driver. The prints are crisp and sharp - quite nice!Overall I am pleased with both the printer and Linux support for it. The built-in foomatic driver is really quite acceptable - I just wanted to squeeze a little more quality out of the printer by installing the proprietary Brother drivers."," The instructions tell you to power up the Brother HL-2140 Laser Printer BEFORE plugging the USB into the computer. It will print a one-time test page. Well, when I plugged it in my UPS almost immediately shut down, killing everything! Apparently this laser printer consumes a LOT more current than did my previous HP Deskjet 6940. After moving the power cord directly to a wall socket instead of the UPS, I tried again. This time the one-time test sheet printed out perfectly. I'm not thrilled with the envelope feeder. The feed rollers crinkle the envelope, which the HP Deskjet 6940 never did. It does work, well, however. I fed several envelopes with 100% feed reliability."," The HL-2140 appeared to work fine except that I noticed that the test page's grayscale 70% through 100% all printed as solid black. I decided to try Brother's proprietary drivers and loaded Brother's lpr and cups drivers per the post at http://www.openprinting.org/printer/Brother/Brother-HL-2140  dated 26 Feb 2009, set the new driver as default and printed a new test page.

Having to run a PC as a print server (burning wattage 24/7), or purchasing a special $200 print server from Canon is simply unacceptable.

I didn't even bother to stick the CD in. Windows 7 recognized the printer and the install went without a hitch. I printed the first test page and it turned out great - nice readable text and clear, crisp lines.I filled the paper tray with about 300 sheets of paper and printed several pages without any page curls, creases, or pages sticking together.

Paper tray is hidden and protected, and large enough for common home and student needs.  Installs fairly easy in Windows XP."," As other reviewers have mentioned, there is some paper curl with this printer.  When I first read about that, I imagined something terribly annoying, but in my experience with this printer it's really no big deal, since the curled paper thankfully tends to uncurl as it cools.  Moreover, I have heard that most all non-professional laser printers suffer from this problem to some degree or another.  So it's not like you're going to avoid the problem by getting a different model laser printer in the sub-$200 range."," Inkjet printers have always given me headaches.  The ink cartridges have short life-spans and are expensive to replace (laser toner cartridges are expensive, too, but you don't have to replace them nearly as often!).  All the inkjet printers I've owned have given me driver and installation frustrations, too.  They all seem not to work consistently, freezing up and not communicating with the PC.

So much faster than inkjet! My inkjet is now a boat anchor.  Ordered Friday night late , here Monday!

Nothing stands out as excellent.," Canon customer service is very poor.  Toner cartridge furnished with printer is not warranted.  Printer left long white strips vertically down page.  Canon claimed it was toner cartridge and wanted to sell a new toner cartridge at $79+ to do further testing on a new printer 1 day old.  After examining it further it was obviously a defective rolled pressing to hard on the pages, but Canon insisted on the purchase of a new toner before they would do anything at all. Newegg saved the day by replacing the whole thing. Scanner has minimal resolution. Printer noisy while feeding paper.  Compared with other multifunction printer this one is very large.  The second printer works OK, but is not anything special.  Just think for the price of a ""started"" cartridge Canon has lost a customer.  Their cost must be less than $10.00.  Great marketing strategy Canon."," The printer only has one computer interface (USB).  Naturally Canon does not furnish a cable.

I have made numerous purchases on Newegg and have been by far one of the best online businesses I have worked with. These printers have been a great bang for the buck and have far exceeded my expectations.  They work flawlessly on both XP and Vista 64.  I haven't experienced no problems from either one and I have owned and used them for 15 months.  I had only 2 paper jams on one of them out of about 9000 prints. The cartridge that comes packed with a new box is a ""full"" cartridge not a starter.  That's awesome because most manufacturers for some reason include ""starter"" cartridges.  The toner cartridges have been yielding well over 2500 pages closer to 3000.  All my prints are still coming out clean. There are still no print lines, marks, or inking imperfections.  The print speed is very good. Cold start warm up time to print takes only seconds.  It's a basic printer but it's done everything I've ask it to do and has done it well.", Features are limited compared to other printers but then again printers that have more features usually cost more.   Obviously it doesn't print in color (it's monochrome) but it does scan in color. It doesn't have automatic two sided prints.  You can print two sides but you have to manually feed the paper back in one at a time.  No wireless capabilities.  It's also quite bulky and is tall so you will need to dedicate some space to emplace it.  OEM cartridge cost is a bit pricey but most laser printers are. I haven't complained since I've been getting a large yield from the OEM factory toners. I haven't tried an aftermarket yet but I've noticed that they are half the price.  I may try one some day.," Depending on your needs this printer is rock solid in terms of value and reliability.  I have no regrets in this purchase and even purchased a third one as a gift for a family member.  Again, this is a basic printer but it does everything exceptionally well. It copies and scans in a respectable amount of time.  Assembly instructions were easy to follow and took me less than 15 minutes to set up out of the box.  If you are looking for a economical multi-function laser printer with basic features then I have to make a strong recommendation for this one.",4,4

The cost per page is very low.  This maintenance cost is the only one that really matters when you've done the economic analysis.

Toner can't dry out like ink DOES, and when was the last time that you've seen somebody buy a color ink cartridge?  The people I know don't buy color cartridges.  They prefer the cheaper option of black ink cartridges.  If they are only going to buy black cartridges, then why would they want an ink printer anyway?  The only reason to get an ink printer is if you are printing a lot of color prints, or you are printing a lot of photos.  Most people only need a black printer, and laser printers have much less cost per page than ink printers.  Toner has a much greater shelf life than ink, which dries out.

My assumption was that a page would equal a full page of type written material using standard type, nothing fancy.  I further presumed that a screenplay, being more terse than a novel, would yield more pages.  Alas, this was not my fate.  It seems 700 'Brother' pages equates to 141 pages of a standard screenplay.

After several back and forths as to what was standard the rep decided that a 'page' had the following definition:  1 Brother Toner Page = a quick note.  I laughed and then asked if that also applied to the 10,000 page drum.  If, by Brother's standard, 700 pages = 141 pages and 1 page = 1 quick note.  Therefore, 1 screenplay page = 5 quick notes.

Got on sale here at Newegg for great price & with free shipping.," The power consumption issue that others speak of here is a major problem for me.  I decided to take the risk of this and try it for myself since the price was right but am regretting it now.  Not only does this printer cause the lights to dim/flicker when it warms up & when it prints, but it is affecting other devices in the same room that require clean power.  If setup through my UPS & power conditioner as with my old laserjet, it crashes the UPS thereby shutting down everything else (PCs, monitor, scanner, etc).  If setup direct into an outlet in the room the UPS screams when it comes on but manages to keep the other devices running - but just barely.  This is not good design. This thing seems to draw more power than my clothes dryer!!!  Unfortunately here in my home office all of the outlets come off the same circuit so I do not have the option of trying to attach this elsewhere in the room (if I could even get USB cable to reach far enough to a diff location for this printer)."," I am seeing if it would be possible to set this printer up with a wireless network print server in a different room on a different circuit.  Investigating thus far this task seems to be fraught with multiple issues - it may be hard, or impossible, to even find a printer server device that is compatible with this printer, let alone one that costs less than what this printer cost me in the first place.  I've never had this power problem with any other printer, including other laserjets, that I've owned.",2,3

Works great with windows 7 and Brother's web site is really good ... easy to find information and drivers."," I have tried several off brands of toner cartridges and have not had good luck, eventually just deciding to bite the bullet and paying the money for the Brother cartridges.  There is only one small annoyance for me:  the view window in the cartridge that the printer will use to decide you are out of toner and refuse to print anymore.  People here have pointed out that you block he window with tape then the printer will exhaust the cartridge.  The drums are expensive and cost as much or more than the entire printer (when it is on sale).  Come now .. does that make sense?"," The two piece drum-toner has advantages and disadvantages.  The problem is that by pricing the drum the same as the entire printer, you're almost making people use these printers as disposables.

I've had problems with it since day one. I use the wireless mode and so long as I never receive an error it works fine. The first error that pops up however, no paper, connectivity issues, etc, brings my amateur printing world to a grinding halt. Consequently, it will go unused for weeks until I finally get angry enough to go figure out what it wants. It often will say there is a jam when there is not. It will tell me to load the toner when I have done so.  And just like magic, repeating something that I've done many times before will cause it to resume printing. Sometimes the only fix is to wire a PC up to it so it will tell me to remove the toner and re install it though I've already done this.

NEVER NEVER NEVER," Printer lasted about 150 pages and then spit out a page with a dirty back and steady red on light #2. No error codes, computer shows as ready, will mechanically reset and revert to dead with steady red light #2.I called Pantum support and a rep called me back, and we went through all the standard procedures of troubleshooting that I had done 3 times already before I called. He deemed it a hardware issue and I was told that someone from hardware support would contact me.........that is when the fun really started. I have called them repeatedly, with no result. I was told that hardware support was out to lunch a few times, and a few times told that they are actually in China.Emails to pantumsupport@abs-inc.com just go into a black hole with no response.

Now I know I have TWO years of useless warranty support. Like an idiot, I purchased a replacement toner cartridge on 12/27 that I am stuck with and the replacement warranty I purchased for this from Newegg will not be honored until the manufacturer warranty expires.If Pantum is trying to break in to the US market, this unbelievable lack of care will be their undoing. Stick with a brand from a real company that you can rely on. The Pantum 2 year warranty is just a useless abstract with no substance.

Total cost about $50.00.   Things started off OK... was a little quirky getting the wireless up... but it worked and printed well for a short while.  That was at the start of October.  Now it's December 22nd and both the original toner cartridge and the 'new' replacement both cause the LED #2 Orange light to come on indicating that they are 'expired' ... whatever that is supposed to mean.  Toner was stored in sealed package in a dry and cool place.  How is it expired!?!?," I tried this laser because I'm sick of being ripped off by inkjets that dry up, clog and otherwise 'expire.'  If I had realized that these toner cartridges are also set to 'expire' I wouldn't have bothered.  Not cool. Pantum and Sailner certainly won't be seeing any more business from me.UPDATE 4/10/2016Since my original 12/22/2015 review this printer has been sitting as I contemplate tossing it in the trash.  I decided to give it one more chance and started mucking with it again.  Still was getting the ""Toner Expired"" lights... then when checking the printer settings I noticed the web interface was reporting that the cartridge was not installed.  I pulled it out to inspect it for the 100th time... toner seal ribbon was removed properly, the toner chip contacts appeared to be clean and accessible.  Then I wet my finger and wiped it across the toner chip contacts... and it came away black with toner dust.  Wiped the contacts dry and re-inserted the cartridge... the green lights came on and the printer is now printing (at least for the moment!)So it you're getting indicator lights on the printer telling you the toner is expired... check the web interface and see if it says the cartridge is not installed.  Even if the contacts LOOK clean... clean them anyway and try re-installing the toner.  Right now my doorstop is printing and I've upped my star rating to 3 stars.  Pantum has no online support... just a list of phone numbers listed on their web site.  They really need to up their game if they want to be successful in this market.

Nice small printer fits well on corner of dresser/desk.  Both Girls have had no difficulty using with their Macbooks.  Only intended for printing school work, and is working great.  One daughter was printing stunningly good B&W pictures from her phone but blew through the starter cartridge fast.  The other daughter is still on the starter cartridge.  It has 2 wireless modes.  In one case you configure it to the existing WIFI network (not tried).  In the other mode, DEFAULT, it just serves up its own SSID.  Just connect wirelessly to the SSID, and print.  No password or setup required.  One daughter does this the other uses USB.   Also found Linux drivers online and it worked fine with Ubuntu/Mint.  I wish I had a reason to buy another.  I found the setup straight forward without a lot of the nonsense utilities packaged with most printers.",None,None

If you have a smartphone or tablet, you can print from the Brother app. Best thing about the HL-2270DW is it can use off-brand/third party replacement toner. Brother's high yield TN-250 toner is around $60. There's lots of third party toners for this printer, but I've found Linkyo is the best.

For example, it's loud enough that I can tell the printer is printing from another room. Hmmm...for some, maybe that's a good thing. The low-toner error message is also a bit of a headache because it will pop up at an inopportune time, and the printer will no longer let you print with that cartridge unless you cover the clear windows on each side with a couple of small pieces of electrical tape. This blocks the printer's optical sensors from reading the toner level so you can squeeze the last few sheets from the cart"," I have owned many laser printers and multi-function laser machines over the past 30 years, and this one ranks up there with the best of them. I was sold on Brother printers and multi-function machines many years ago, so the brand name alone meant something to me. What I particularly like about the HL-2170W aside from its excellent printing and paper-management qualities is how well it operates in WiFi mode. For example, the location of my wireless router made it difficult and inconvenient to locate a printer in the same location tethered to the wireless router hub, so I needed a wireless WiFi printer as a stand-alone device, and this printer suited my needs perfectly. The install was a cinch, and in over six months of ownership, I have not had to reset the printer's WiFi settings at all. In other words, it has never been bumped offline.

There's a crazy button combination to fix it.(From the support site)Turn off the machine.Make sure that the front cover is closed and the power cord is plugged in.Hold down the Go button as you turn on the power switch. Keep the Go button pressed down until all the LEDs light up, and then the Ready LED turns off.Release the Go button. Make sure that all the LEDs turn off.Press the Go button six times.

The toner that comes with it is only a starter (around 1000 pages they say, but in reality you get around 300-400 pages with 50% page coverage and I managed to squeeze out another 200 extra page with the tape trick). - USB setup is easy- There's some 3rd party toner and drums available for much better prices.- Awesome price", - For some reason I had problems with that wireless setup (and i'm a computer technician). At first I couldn't find the printer and then when I connected to the printer I couldn't find my network. Tried with Ad-Hoc setup and wired setup both wouldn't work. Resetted everything and started from scratch. Then everything started working. Go figure why..., Probably one of the best laser printers available for that price and the tape trick is nice.

It sounds like something is grinding in it.  I will see how long it holds together.

9SIA9JJ3H17350,28-113-545,7/1/2013 8:52:33 AM,Anonymous,What a surprise,1, It prints, I bought this unit to supplement a HP5000 large format laser printer which does not have the optional Duplex attachment. Considering the price I did not expect much but I seem to have received even less. I am used to companies shipping printers with “starter toner” but Brother has taken this to a new low level. I was able to print a little over 100 pages when I received a toner low message and managed to get about 10 more pages before receiving a replace toner message. At this point the printers will no longer print. Irritating enough but the message keeps popping up on every computer which has the printer driver installed. So while I wait for a replacement toner I can keep myself entertained with the replace toner message which keeps popping up. If this is Brothers idea of a good customer experience form something in my face I can only imagine what they did inside the printer to lower the level.Other items. A bit of a pain to set up wirelessly which I guess is understandable for a unit with no readout available. It also makes strange grinding noises unless it is in a sleep mode. The unit is light and easy to move around which will make it easy to throw away which is probably what I’ll do when the replacement toner runs out. A couple of years ago I purchased my wife a Canon all in one for only a little more then I paid for this unit. The Canon is a much better unit and if it weren’t for the fact I was looking for a smaller unit to fit beside the HP I would have purchased another Canon.

Excellent text quality at 600 dpi, very good at 300 dp - obviously superior to any inkjet.  Has a bunch of features like printing multiple pages per sheet and ""manual duplexing"" which are semi-gimmicky, but that can be useful, and they do work."," Goes through toner pretty quickly, especially at higher print quality settings.  Drum life also seems short.  In my case, the printer shows the drum nearing its end of life with < 1600 pages printed, when rated life is 12,000 pages.  I understand rated life is a working fiction for comparison purposes, but this seems extreme.As others have noted, the automatic low toner shutdown ""feature"" is truly maddening.Manual feeder difficult to adjust and, in practice anyway, only holds one sheet/envelope at a time."," My cost per page has not been as good as some others report, but I think it's still lower than a good quality inkjet with obviously better text/line graphic quality.  Image print quality is not good, but it's rare that any B&W laser prints good quality images, let alone low-end ones.Can be found on sale for $90-100.

It wasn't too bad to initially set up even on a fairly secure WLAN, but periodically (maybe once a week or a bit less), it loses its connection and it's hell getting it to work again.  It usually sits in the same room as my WAP and no other devices on the network have such problems."," I gave up on wireless for several weeks and went with a CAT5 connection.  That was fine until yesterday and that became unresponsive too.  Numerous power cycles eventually brought it back.

This printer is small and is wireless, so it's easy to stash it anywhere you want to.  It does an average job of printing graphics, but I mainly got it as a text/presentation printer, and the inkjet is still useful for graphics, scanning, copying, etc.Setup is pretty easy in Windows 7.  Set it up on three different computers on a wireless network in about 15 minutes."," The graphics are a bit below what I expected, but I wouldn't use a laser printer for that type of job anyway.I'm sure it's just an unfortunate coincidence, but the exhaust fan is on the right side of the printer, which is causing me to leave it a few more inches from the wall in the location that I had wanted to use."," The box does not include USB or ethernet cables.  I'm sure most people have patch cables lying around, so not a big deal, but having a spare ethernet cable handy makes setting up wireless much easier.The lights in my spare bedroom dim when the printer starts a job.Got this printer on mega sale, and it arrived 2 days later with $2 ground shipping.

I am very experienced with computers and even after reading reviews complaining about the difficulty of the setup and the problems that occur down the road, I still thought I could put my computer skills to good use and fix any problems that may occur. I was completely wrong. One would think the mere act of pulling out the drum unit, replacing the toner or even cleaning the corona wire after a notification that it is dirty would be a simple process, but many times it would take HOURS to get the computer or the printer to realize that the drum unit was clean or that the toner was full.

And my wireless network does use password restricted WPA2 access.Installing the printer driver was also a breeze. The printer apparently has a Windows driver embedded into it so if you navigate to its setup page (by IP address), you can just download it directly from the printer. Didn't have any problems with Windows Vista and Windows 7.Setup took me 5-10 mins (longer to unbox the thing than to get it onto the network).", Doesn't come with a full toner cartridge but that's not a huge deal (supposedly a 700 page one instead of the 1600 page ones if you buy a new cartridge for it)., Mine did come with a  3 feet or so USB cable (that I didn't even end up using). Thought most manufacturers were skimping on the USB cables now a days.Only thing that remains to be seen is its durability/lifespan but I'm very satisfied with the setup procedure.,6,6

The current listed price is even lower than what I bought it at a couple weeks ago too. Although I would normally be quite miffed at such deflation, the price I paid was so low already this actually did not bother me at all.2: Cheap TonersNewEgg sells the generic version of the X25 cartridge that this printer uses under its Rosewill house brand, so you don’t have to worry about getting ripped off later.3: It WorksI bought this MFC with the intention of setting it up on a new 64 bit Windows 7 system.  Driver installation did take a few extra minutes, but the print and scan functions work fine afterwards. No comments on the fax since I have yet to try it.4: Comes with Presto PageManager 7.15 and ScanSoft Omnipage SE 4.0Both of these will work in 64 bit systems if you care. You can always get free and better ones off the web anyway."," 1: The bundled drivers are for Windows 98/ME/2k/XP and 32 bit Vista. They are not compatible with 64 bit systems, and this could be a deal breaker for the unprepared. It is possible to resolve this problem with a little work however; see instructions below for more detail. One egg off the rating is due to this.2: The bundled Canon MF Toolbox is not compatible with 64 bit drivers. This is not a big loss since the MF Toolbox is just your typical junkware. It is basically a floating toolbar with a couple buttons on it that allow you to access some scan functions quickly. If you are actually reading this review then you are already too sophisticated to need it.3: No USB cable, so make sure you have one ready to go.How to install on 64 bit Windows 7:1: Download 64 bit drivers from Canon website (keyword: Canon printer drivers).2: Run the file you downloaded and it will self-extract the drivers into a folder in the same location.(continued below)"," 3: Follow the instructions in the Starter Guide. Do not be alarmed if the drivers refuse to install.4: Connect the MFC to your printer with a USB cable.5: Ignore Windows’ complaint and go to Start Menu  > Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Devices and Printers. The MFC will probably be listed under “Unspecified” with an exclamation mark.6: Right click on the MFC and choose Properties > Change Settings > Update Driver > Browse. Find the folder where you extracted your drivers to in step 2 above.  One of your MFC’s three drivers will then be installed.7: Look in your Devices and Printers menu again and find the MFC under a new name; it was listed as a scanner in my case. Right click on the MFC and choose Properties > Hardware. Select one of the other two listed functions, then go through Properties > Driver > Update Driver > Browse, and locate your drivers again.8: Repeat step 7 to make sure you get scan, print, and fax drivers all installed.",125,126

It took them about 3 minutes to realize it was, as well. I let it sit in a box for 5 months untouched before trying to set it up otherwise it would have gone straight back to Newegg."," Defective. Powered up, all lights lit up and stayed lit up including the error light, the processing light, and the scan/fax/copy lights. Nothing whatsoever I could do would make this printer do anything. Changed USB cables, removed toner/paper, tried to get it un-bricked every way I could but nothing. Completely bricked."," In all fairness to Canon they did offer warranty service through a 3rd party but I'd have to drive 80 miles round trip twice (to drop it off, then later to pick it up) and the cost of gas for that would be roughly 1/4 what I paid for the printer (I got it during a cut-rate sale sale last fall). Not too pleased about that, but I will probably have to do it anyway, it has too many features to be cheaply replaced.

I'm not sure if this is the problem, but I've never had so much trouble lining up the finished printing, especially when printing a long document or numerous copies of a single document.  Especially noticeable on double-sided printing.As a result of these two things, forget about printing a hundred or more pages of double-sided copy.

The best thing about the Brother printers was that they were much cheaper to use on an ongoing basis.  The toner was inexpensive compared to other brands like HP, and lasted way beyond rated number of pages.  Not with this series, the toner costs are MUCH WORSE.  There is no geting around the page limits (yet).  When you print that last page (1500 or 3 reams on low cap., 2600 or 5 reams+ on high cap.) you better have a replacement handy, as the printing will STOP.  The old units let you shake the cartridge and clean the wire to get a few more pages, and you could use all the toner inside.  Not this model."," If you use as a home printer, with LOW throughput, this is a great deal. If you print a lot of pages with low coverage (a few lines of text per page, no toner consuming graphics), as I do, this is a bad choice.  Just like the companies who give away the razors so you would be locked into Their blades and cartridiges.Hopefully, as the printer gets older, there will be some ""store brand"" cartridges avaliable at lower prices.Oh yeah, Newegg is the best.  Fast delivery, great prices and support.  The ""3"" is for Brother becoming more like HP on their replaceables.",3,4

No paper jams yet.," Setup software installed the driver (in win 8.1) and brought the painter online with my network very easily. The only issue that I have is my printer driver kept disappearing.

Setup was on a machine with Win8.1 installed.  Had things up and running in less than 10 minutes.  Wireless setup with the included disc was not as easy.  The network discovery page yielded nothing when searching for available networks to connect to.  This would be with the router 10 feet away from the 2502W.  I went ahead and logged into the local support page to pull IP information, and setup went without incident using manual settings.  At the time of my initial install, there were no driver updates on Pantum’s extremely slow support site.  That has changed in the past couple of weeks, with full support for all modern operating systems.  I DLed the newest Win8.1 driver, reinstalled wirelessly – and all available networks showed up just fine.Really pleased with the overall performance/features of the P2502W.  The high majority of printing done in our home is of the document variety.  Our Lexmark AIO burns through cartridges, even with “quick print” settings, so we have things setup where the 2502W handles all of our document work, and the Lexmark gets everything else.  With economy ink settings, documents still look nice, and with higher quality settings – they look excellent.  We've put over 300 pages through the 2502W during the past three weeks, and have had no smearing, no jams, and no lost document jobs – only excellent results. Speeds on the economy setting are right around the 24 ppm rate, and it’s nice to not have the printer shaking violently with that kind of continuous output.  Definite advantage to a laser printer.Only real concern outside of device longevity (not a lot of history with the 2502W) is the cost and availability of the toner cartridges.  Newegg has been out of stock for weeks, and I was only able to locate a single online site with available stock.  Price was $33 more than the Newegg offering (standard yield cartridge).  I list cost as a concern, NOT because output for the price is lacking, but because $83 is a larger than average chunk for a consumer to drop on a new toner cartridge in one sitting.  I feel that you definitely get what you pay for with the stock toner cartridge, but when you can’t find one for the listed $50, and have to go spend a significant amount more than that – it’s definitely disappointing.  Hoping Pantum is able to improve their cartridge stock levels in the future.I think the 2502W is a great choice for a quality, budget monochrome laser printer.  Good print quality, ink savings, and build quality are definite highlights.  Get that web site speed up to modern standards, and improve the in-stock position of the toner cartridges – and I think you have a definite winner on your hands. Easy “YES” recommendation from me.  Give this little known brand a shot – you won’t be disappointed.",3,3

Some curl to the paper(20# economy stuff) from the heat though not drastic .. on par for laser."," Great little printer, especially for the price. Seems solidly built, very fast, great print quality. Exceptionally small footprint on your desk. Print quality is great (haven't tried any graphics ... not what I bought it for anyway). Find the IP address it sets up on (check your router config or watch the setup screen.) There is an integrated web server at that address which provides easy access to all needed settings. Didn't see that in documentation, but tried it as I am used to that method with commercial printers ... and sure enough its there and quite well done at that! (Wireless settings mentioned in other reviews are there too ... can't turn of the hotspot but you can and should secure it.) I would recommend assigning a fixed IP address to it; not difficult but not enough room here to provide step by step nor did I see it in the documentation. I did not find any of the toner complaints mentioned in other reviews. There are two packing materials that need to be removed from the cartridge before use. Could be missed as the cartridge comes already in the printer but must be removed to get these out. I have to wonder if that got missed by those having trouble. Take the cartridge out; remove the black wrapping paper; pull the tape-looking piece out of the end of the cartridge; reload into the printer. Note - avoid leaving the cartridge out in the light for an excessive time - that can desensitize the drum and adversely affect print quality!Overall, I am pleasantly surprised with the exception of the manual. Was no problem to get it up and running for me, but I do work in printing professionally ... have to think the manual's shortcomings could cause problems for less experienced users. Still, seems to be a very nice piece of equipment!",3,3

OEM toner appears to be a bit low quality, carts are ""chipped"" so refilling probably isn't going to happen and I've yet to find generic brand toner for this printer.  Also, OEM toner in itself isn't easy to find.Toner yields are lower by laser standards but you don't buy this printer for high volume printing.- While Mac setup was effortless, Windows update couldn't find the drivers on its own.

N82E16828731010,28-731-010,7/29/2014 8:31:48 AM,Donald T.,Wireless wouldn't work,1," Compact size. The configuration utility automatically detected both the wireless adapter of the printer, and all available wireless access points. Since I never did get the wireless to actually connect, I did a test printout via the USB cable, and found print quality to be quite good."," Even though the print quality with the USB cable is good, I'm only giving this one star due to problems with getting it configured.I plugged the USB cable into my Toshiba laptop that's running Windows Vista, and got the software to install okay. However, when I went to configure the wireless connection, I found that I was unable to.I wanted to connect it to my wireless access point, but I found that the ""Paste"" function is disabled for the password field. For me, that's a real problem, because my wireless access password is 63 characters of random letters, numbers, and characters, which was generated by Keepass. For everything else, I can just copy and paste the password into whatever website or utility that I'm using, and it's all good. With this, there was neither ""Ctrl-V"" nor right-click menu functionality. So, I decided to try connecting directly to the printer. The menu for that option gave me the choice of ""None"", ""WEP"", or ""WPA/WPA2"" for security. I clicked on ""WPA/WPA2"", and was asked for a password. That's great, except that there's no place to configure a password. So, I chose ""None"", figuring that it would connect okay. However, it never did. The wireless light on the printer continued flashing slowly the whole time, indicating that it was searching for a network connection, but no connection was ever made. Also, I pulled up ""InSSIDer"" on the computer, and verified that the printer's wireless adapter was being properly identified. (It was.)Then, I tried again to connect to the wireless access point, and tried entering my 63-character password manually. As you can imagine, it didn't connect that way, either. I didn't take the time to try that again, because entering that long of a complex password is too prone to error. So then, I tried multiple times to connect directly without security, trying something different each time. Each time, I was unsuccessful.I even pulled out my spare wireless access point, which uses a shorter, easier to type password than what the other one uses. I was careful to type the password into the printer configuration utility correctly, but it still wouldn't connect. (I verified with inSSIDer that the access point is accessible.)"," There's neither excuse nor good reason for disabling the ""Paste"" functionality for the password field. For those of us with long, complex passwords on our wireless routers, Copy and Paste functionality is an absolute must.If only the wireless function would have worked for me, I likely would have given this a better review.",5,18
N82E16828731010,28-731-010,7/23/2014 3:36:33 PM,Thomas B.,Value Laser Printer,4, The Pantum P2502W comes in at a great price point for the features included.  Wireless functioned without a hitch.  Printer speed ranged from 20-25 ppm depending on amount of text/graphics on the page.," The toner installation process can create quite a mess.  To install the toner, you must remove a thin plastic strip that runs through the cartridge.  While doing this, a decent amount of toner is pulled out as well.Drivers for this printer are not yet available on the painfully slow Pantum website.  When I first received this printer, I wanted to make sure to have the newest drivers.  After several hours of their site being down, I was finally able to browse for this model.  Unfortunately, the site did not have any drivers for the 2502W.  Even today, only Asia/Africa region drivers are available for this printer on the Pantum web site.Paper... This laser printer is extremely picky of the type of paper used.  When using multipurpose paper, a random amount of toner would be left on the top of every sheet after printing.  To resolve the issue, I switched to laser printer paper and haven't yet had a recurrence of the problem.Lastly, the paper tray on this printer is not quiet when printing.  If you are planning to purchase this printer, it wouldn't be wise to place it in a room where people will be sleeping if you need to print some late night work."," The Pantum P2502W makes great strides in getting a wireless black and white laser printer into the standard household by hitting a very reasonable price point.  While having to perform the initial configuration via USB was a nuisance, it proved to be only a minor inconvienence in getting the printer onto a wireless network.  If you do pick up this printer, be sure to hold onto the driver CD as the drivers are not yet available for the US on the Pantum website.  Also, laser printer paper should alleviate the problems associated with this toner leaving smudges on the top of printed paper.On a final note, during my testing time I had printed out approximately 150 pages containing a mix of graphics and text and still have 80% toner capacity as indicated by Windows.",8,8
N82E16828731010,28-731-010,7/23/2014 10:06:04 AM,Charles E.,Not bad for the money,3, Looks sleek. Small compact size. Toner cart (which I prefer for business). Wireless. Easy setup.," User manual not detailed enough, doesn't support windows phones. Build quality is okay for this price point but I've seen much better."," I didn't bother attaching this via USB to any of the computers in my home. This is a wirless printer and that is what I wanted to test. The phone and tablets located and established a link to this printer quickly. Very quick setup. Downloading the app to my iphone, ipad and android tablet was quick and I was printing within a few minutes. I was not shocked when i saw they do not offer an app for the windows based phones. I'm getting used to that but considering how good the windows phones are; more so for business; I am still disappointed. This printer responds quickly and prints fairly fast. I have had absolutely no issues with this printer at all. No jamming, no loss connections. It just works. The toner cart is not going to last very long and the price to replace the cart is about half the cost of the printer which is typical these days.The truth is this printer doesn't take up much desk space. I find that it is very convenient as I have it situated in our living room in the media cab because we do a lot of surfing online and my wife does a lot of work from home. We can both print out emails, business docs, online receipts without having to head back to the office. This is pretty cool and I really don't think i would want to be without a wireless printer. Sure there are better options out there but at the end of the day this printer gets the job done and fairly well at that. Will I buy from this company in the future? Well I can say that until using this unit I had not heard of the company and I might be tempted to stick with a better known brand BUT only time will tell. 1 year from now if this printer is still going strong....I'll have much for respect for it.Need a wireless yet affordable printer? One that prints quickly? One that takes up little space? Well then this might be the right one for you. I've seen and used better but I have used a lot worse. I would give this a solid 3.5 stars if I could. But 3 will have to do.",4,6

I like others thought that the admin wifi login and details should be on the printed paper manual, they have instead for phones, which is ok but computer setup is what this thing is being directed towards?  I first setup the unit with the usb cable, then after that I went and did the setup for the wifi, once I found the IP and logged in, after digging through the digital manual to see the details for the web login I was in and unplugged the USB.  .  I was able to change admin password and add hotspot password, I do not think having no password for hotspot by default is a good idea. Testing the printer, first day was great, printed simple document of 4 pages.  Left for a few days.  Wanted to test it out more and print longer document, start the print, I get a paper Feed error pop up on my screen.  So I tried to reposition the paper. Hit print and nothing! Same thing.  So I took out the cartridge and looked, everything fine no jam, paper is going and lining up right.  Tried again same thing!  Out of frustration I took out cartridge and moved the roller that feeds the paper, its on a cam, it rotated fine.  Then I hit print, got through one page printing just fine, 2nd page did not feed! Same issue.Bottom line the unit, probably got passed QA somehow and some sensor is not functioning right, I managed to do that same step a few times, but got tired real quick.  The printer despite having flimsy doors, and not having any monochrome display (I am spoiled with all the printers having nice display)  I really believe the average user would get frustrated fast without an actual error being shown, nobody wants to decipher the flashing blinking lights.  Though sadly looking in this price range on laser printers it just seems to be a trend for some reason, no display on the monochrome printers.  I will try and contact customer support and see if any solution can be had with the paper feeder malfunction.If the unit would function properly I would give it 3.5-4 stars.",4,4

A starter toner is included with the printer (Pantum PB-210 Toner (standard capacity: 1,600 pages for those interested)) but came in separate packages; even though the printer box said to ""ensure the following parts are included in the box"" showing a toner cartridge - safe to assume a starter toner is include with the purchase of this printer huh? As with any toner cartridge installation can be messy so be careful. Installation however is very easy - just follow the instructions on the toner cartridge box. The printer itself has a very simple interactive interface while having quite the interesting LED indicators. There may be only 2 LED lights (one for paper jam and WiFi connectivity and the other for alerts and info) each refer to something specific on their own and also something else based on which one is lit/flashing, its color, etc.; which is detailed in the digital user manual found by clicking on User Manual link upon auto-loading the included CD - troubleshooting section."," - Makes no mention that an admin panel exists in the included paper user manual or setup guide which is very important to know! - it's buried in the digital user manual located on the included CD- Forced to keep ""Pantum-AP"" in the wireless hotspot SSID- Not allowed to change the username from the default ""admin""- Manual duplex printing - I would prefer to save paper and would be nice if it was automatic- Can't change printing preferences from within the mobile app (locked-in at 240 x 320 DPI as per the digital user manual, section 6.1)PRINTER WIRELESS ADMIN PANELThere is an admin page that is not readily mentioned anywhere but is buried in the digital user manual under section 4.1. However, once you have installed the printer driver connect via the included CD from a wireless device to the Pantum wireless hotspot AP (I couldn't connect without being connected to the wireless hotspot). After that you can access it via ""192.168.223.1"" in your browser (may be different than mine). There is a ""Log In"" menu item which you should immediately change the password (log in and it's under ""Admin Settings""). The username is ""admin"" and the password, by default, is ""000000"". Once done you can explore the ""Settings"" menu item for the various bits of information and settings that can be tweaked. You can secure the wireless hotspot AP by going to Settings -> Wireless Settings -> Wireless Hotspot -> Wireless Parameter -> Authentication. Click ""Apply"" when done and viola! Secured.Even though you can turn wireless hotspot off I personally recommend leaving it on and securing your wireless hotspot because as far as I can tell from what I have tested the admin panel is only accessible wconnected to the hotspot.You can set up automatic email notifications for when specific situations occur (under Settings -> Machinery Settings -> E-mail Notification); paper tray is empty, toner is low, paper is jammed or catridge has expired. You can specify up to 4 email addresses.In the admin panel under ""Information"" menu you can view various bits of information such as toner remaining, printer status (ex/ sleeping), cartridge status (ex/ normal), serial number, etc.Also, I recommend setting up a static IP for the printer instead of using DHCP or ""IPv4 'automatic' address assigment"" by changing it to ""manual"". If you have a router that is capable of IP route reservations then you can assign it there instead; I personally prefer assigning static IPs from my router as all IP reservations are in one place. When your router decides to lease the printer a new IP address it may require that you have to setup the printer again for printing. So for example, when I look at the Pantum P2500W Series Properties -> Ports (tab) on my computer the printer was set up specific to IP address 192.168.0.102. When the IP changes the printer most likely won't be available for printing...just a potential warning."," PRINT TESTINGBy default the printer is set up to print at 600 dpi which will look great (subjective and depends on what you are printing) but is capable of printing at 1200. As with any printer already set up on your computer you can access printing preferences via the Windows Control Panel -> Hardware and Sound -> Devices and Printers -> Pantum P2200-P2500 Series, right click with the mouse and select ""Printing preferences"" (sorry Mac users I don't have a Mac but you can refer to section 3.2 of the digital user guide included on the CD). You will see the group box named ""Resolution"" with the options for 600 or 1200 DPI. If you want the ""best"" quality prints and not concerned with using more 'ink' then select 1200 and click the ""OK"" button. NOTE: You can also get access to said settings by simply double-clicking on the Pantum printer instead of right-clicking and selecting ""printing preferences"". Once in the Pantum printer 'page' select ""Adjust print options"".Printing actual pages takes a few seconds per page - extremely faster than a typical inkjet printer. The print quality is pretty good at 600. I set my printer preference resolution to 1200 and printed a large photo which turned out pretty darn good! You can expect professional  I must say but I expected such as the specification of the printer is that it prints at 22 ppm. The printed image greyscales showed a wide range of shades with acceptible level of detail. As for the printing noise I can't measure it exactly but it is right up there with my 2 year old inkjet printer.On several occassions once a page was printed I would quickly take the printed page and rub across it vigorously with my finger which didn't result in any smearing or toner residue on my finger; this was the same for both printed text documents and pictures. I tried wetting my finger and rubbing the printed page and experienced no smears as well.Printing from my Samsung S5 using the ""Mobile Printing App"" the prints, both text documents and images, defintely lack print quality compared to printing from my laptop (limited to prints of 240 x 320 DPI as per digital user manual section 6.1). Honestly, being able to print from my phone is a major plus.FINAL THOUGHTSThis printer performs very well for its price-range and is competitive to other laser printers out there. The prints of both documents and pictures are definitely suitable for the typical user who aren't looking for or expecting professional prints (the prints are still very good). The admin panel availability is obscured without digging into the digital user manual as one reviewer apparently missed. The printer appears to be well built but the software could be better. However, I do recommend this printer if you do a lot of black-and-white prints and want a reliable printer. I do recommend secure",43,45
N82E16828731010,28-731-010,7/7/2014 6:25:41 PM,Steven W.,"Inexpensive, fast laser printer!",4," This is a very fast printer optimized to efficiently use  its modest 128MB of printer memory.  Installation is just a breeze!..... unpackage, install toner cartridge, power up and use the supplied cd, voila'...up and printing.   Faster than many of the high end postcript and pcl printers out in the market  since all the processing is handled by the pc itself.  Because this Pantum 2502 is a wireless design you can also capitalize on everyone in the household directing their printing needs  to one device.  Savings are obvious since you no longer have to stock different toner/inks for each of your various printers.  Would be nice to have duplex printing but this is easily remedied by refeeding the printed simplex page a second time provided you manually reinsert the first side correctly.  Pantum web site though slow appears to have drivers not only for windows but also Mac, Android and Linux along with manuals in pdf format."," Complex print jobs with embedded EPS calls might not necessarily ender or print correctly but this is to be expected with a entry level printer such as this Pantum P2502.  Replacement  toner cartridges not readily stocked or sold by third party sellers as yet ....  I suspect Pantum is following HP's printer sales strategy....give away the printer at cost and make up for this with expensive toner cartridge replacements.  Solid area coverage on printouts have a slight but noticeable strobing...again a trait of entry level printers.  Searches on how to refill spent toner cartridges are non existent hence for me it will be a trial and error process just to see if I can successfully refill my own cartridges with easily purchased generic toner.   Until this shortfall is resolved replacement toner cartridges in my opinion are a tad expensive, not readily stocked locally, and presently sold online by a few select vendors.   Paper tray holds roughly 150 sheets of letter sized stock....far too small for large print runs.  Top manual tray according to documentation states envelope printing is acceptable....wrong!.....continuous envelope jams which requires a convoluted way of clearing jammed stock.  Whoever designed this 2502 printer should have thought possibly about a more elegant way of clearing jammed sheets of envelopes/paper stock."," Delivery times by Newegg again is top notch, packaged well, and handled by UPS...what's NOT to like about this?As of this date there are very limited vendors of replacement toner cartridges...even Newegg appears to be out of stock on this one...unusual!",4,4
N82E16828731010,28-731-010,7/7/2014 4:39:40 PM,Yunchang K.,"Good printer, but a few concerns",2," Stupid fast printing, wireless is a big plus, works on iOS devices and Android devices"," Serious concerns with quality of toner, concerns about open wireless AP by printer"," Being an owner of a laser printer myself, it is one of the best purchases you could ever make. I never had an ink jet that lasted more than 2-3 years. That being said, I had a great opportunity to review this printer and share my experiences with you.This Pantum P2502W printer is a sleek looking, compact wireless laser printer. Very easy to install. It doesn't actually seem to have a drum, all you do is insert the toner (and paper) and you're ready to go! I had it print my phone bill of about 44 pages and I stopped counting the time because it was printing them out very fast. I had a little bit of an issue with the wireless set up as I entered my password multiple times and it stated that it could not connect to the wireless network. After the 7th or so try I could get it to connect.Unfortunately as it was printing, every time a page was ejected, I could see copious amounts of EITHER what I think is toner dust (read below why I think this is the case) or vapor.My first big concern with this device is the fact that the wireless AP built into the device that is unsecure remains on. The WiFi button on the printer is a search wireless network button, not an on off button. In an age where computer security is becoming a concern, having a device repeating an AP without security whilst remaining connected to your home WiFi does not reassure me about the security of the device. Unruly people could potentially stop by and start printing things to it without your knowledge. There is no option to password protect this whatsoever. I can see this being a huge security concern.My second biggest concern is the toner quality (P-210). This unit was sent to me to review, I have a hunch that it does not come with a toner (most laser printers will come with a trial toner which has less capacity than a retail one). When I was printing my 44 page wireless bill I could smell, well, toner. And I could see toner dust coming out, unless if the printer is using very hot temperatures and vapor can be seen in a house that's at 80F. My other wireless laser printer emits toner smell but not as bad as this cartridge did. Removing the seals on the toner, also showed copious amounts of toner dust on the front seal and tape seal in the toner. Touching the printed paper, some of the toner actually stuck to my fingers and I could feel the toner.The machine itself is not bad. Again, it is an attractive looking, compact device that is VERY functional. However, because of the stated potential security issue of the printer being connected to your wireless network AND emitting a WiFi signal of its own makes me wonder the bad things that could happen. Also, I am worried about the potential health risks that the toner dust could pose. Until Pantum (Seine Technology) can resolve these issues, I am hesitant on recommending this printer.IF Pantum can resolve these problems, I would not have a problem rating this a full 5 eggs.",11,13

The wireless functionality works perfectly.Documents print quickly, crisp and sharp and since there is no ink there are no smudges."," Customer service was terrible. When I was setting up this printer I could not get my computer to talk to it. I figured it was just a setting I had wrong during the initial setup or there was a setting in Vista prohibiting me. I searched the web for people with similar problems, but all the solutions I found didn't work. I finally called tech support and after I reached a real human I explained the problem. After some back and forth about my setup she could not understand why I would ever want a wireless printer if my computer didn't have wireless capabilities. She then tells me to click the -Connect To- button to see if the printer is listed there. (Since that button is used to locate available wireless networks) When it wasn't listed (Since my computer cant search for wireless networks) she told me it was my router that was to blame and I would have to get it reseted by TredNet and have them open the port the printer needed to talk to my computer. Then she could help me"," Turns out I was right and after I reset my printer all I had to do was change a single option on the wireless setup screen to get the printer working.After my customer service experience I'm only listing the printer a 5 out of 5 since it was only $89. If I had paid $139 or $149 this would be getting 3/5 or 4/5.One last thing about my rep, She asked me where I bought the printer and who manufactured my router. When I told her Newegg.com and TrendNet  she said, ""hmm...I've never heard of that seller are they reliable?"" to newegg.com. To TrendNet she said, ""I haven't heard of them either are they local?"" in this really condescending voice. Not very good service indeed.",2,11

Hard to pass up with wireless and Ethernet built in.Setup was VERY quick and easy.  Printer immediately got an IP address from my wired Ethernet connection and I used BRAdmin Lite (on the driver CD) to assign it another.  Print speed is very quick, even for initially printing from idle.  Quality is excellent.  Have not used too extensively yet (just a few test prints), but has met my expectations.  Would definitely recommend this printer at the price I paid, though I see it has gone up since.  Probably still a very good value.Nice web based interface as well - can modify printer settings from your browser.Overall very happy thus far (only had 1 day though)."," No real ones that I can see.  The single sheet paper feeder is made of cheap plastic, but looks sturdy enough (like most Brother products, I have an MFC-5840CN as well).  There's no display on the printer, just a few LEDs, so you will have to use the software to know what's going on and to perform setup.

Print quality is a little bit better than I expected. The wireless controller seems to work better than I thought it would.  I never intended to use the wireless but it works well enough that I decided to use it and it gave me the flexibility to move the printer to a different electrical circuit where it wouldn't cause electrical noise for the computers.  See cons for more on the electricity., It double fed pages out of the box.  I had to clean all the rollers and the separator pad with belt cleaner to get it to work.  Print quality is OK but don't expect decent contrast unless you use high brightness paper.  It pulls more than 20 amps to warm up the fuser.  I've had to get a couple of other things off the circuit to avoid blowing a fuse every time I want to print something.  The heavy electrical draw would have created a need for power filtering and a couple of new UPS units had I left it on the same circuit with any computers.  It draws more amps than a 45 ppm full size copier I have at work.," I'm a little surprised by the rave reviews others have given this unit.  I guess that must have something to do with the price tag, though.  This does not compare to any HP LJ or any Xerox laser printer I've ever used.  It is not of that sort of quality, but the price is much less than any entry level printer from either of those companies, so maybe that explains it.",3,4

Drum seems to not have started at 100%, even though toner still is."," I agonized over this purchase, but my aging HL-1450 was dying and I did not want to replace the drum and toner on a 7 year old laser.  Read the other reviews here about it losing its IP address, etc.  If you follow the directions in the manual, and set it up using a temporary wire, it will work.  I chose to set it up with a fixed IP address, and then setup the computer using that IP address.  You only need to do that once, so our second computer was set up simply by installing the driver and pointing to that IP address.  All of our computers, printers, and routers, are on power strips and all power off at night.  The settings hold just fine. One thing I tried which did not work ...

They told me that as a ""courtesy"" they will extend my warranty for one month from the date of purchase.  The reason why i put this in the con is i don't agree with that at all.  If I was closer to the end of warranty and they replaced it, I'd have a brand new printer with a 2 month warranty left (assuming i only had 1 month left when it broke).When i mentioned this to the Tech, she got very defensive and told me that all of this is a ""courtesy"" to the customer and that they don't have to do it.

Both my netgear/linksys routers are the size of the book, you don't need an active internet connection just take the router alone.3.  Reset the printer to factory network settings.  To do this turn off the printer.  Hold the blue demo button and turn on the printer while holding the demo button down for about 7 seconds. 4.  Let go of demo button and then press the demo"," or any other firewalls you have on.5.  Put supplied cd in drive and let autoplay.  Select the 2170w printer and choose to install wireless and drivers.  It will ask you automatic or step by step, pick step by step.  It should detect everything and the rest is just pressing next.  Lastly remove the ethernet wire once everything is done and it should work.Don't attempt over the air, a lot of problems arise.  Any trouble in detecting the wireless printer or network and it gets tricky, look at the instruction manual.",None,None

Under XP you have full control over the printer's specific settings and warnings.Linux supported! A positive!"," Linux driver was a bit confusing to me to install.

After doing each install I downloaded the Brother-HL-2170W-pxlmono.ppd file and used it to setup Hardy 8.04. Worked great thereafter.Runs hot when printing resulting in page curl. If you want double side pages, you can only do one at a time. It is not meant for this use. When it comes out of sleep, it is a bit noisy. The cooling fan makes all the noise and then more noise when its drawing the paper and printing. (It's not bad but just so the you know). Once a page has been printed on, don't put it back in the tray, the page curl will cause the printer to jam.

I'm astonished to say this has been my experience using the HL-2170W was a wireless printer.I followed the instructions by first connecting the printer to my router via an ethernet cable.  Under Windows XP, the simple drivers detected the printer on my network, then walked me through the wireless configuration of the device.

However, you should make sure you have a spare ethernet cable, as they recommend you initially set the printer up over a temporary wired link (this is the method I used)."," The printer comes with a starter toner cartridge good for 1000 pages.

Usually when you buy a printer these days, you're also getting hundreds of megs of unstable bloated drivers and useless utilities in the ""bargain.""

I just get busy and sidetracked with what I am working on. This is a very easy brother monocrome laser printer to setup. I advise if you are going to hook it up wireless though, you setup wireless printing feature first with an ethernet cable before you set up local usb printing, or network printing. I talked to a brother rep on the phone, because I needed to get it hooked up wireless for a client/friend as soon as possible. I set it up with USB connection first, and she had me putting all these types of codes in to reset it.  I also asked for documentation on it, which they do provide you with guides and everything. I got it for $99.99 on sale and the first one I ordered I got on sale as well. ""Thanks to newegg"""," Waiting for Brother Support can take a while, customer reps might not be as charming as you think they would be. Go figure, customer service sure lacks in todays world. I'm an IT and I usually troubleshoot on my own. You would think it would be all plug N play, or alot simple to setup 802.11b/g wireless printing. However, once you set it up, its worth it. My Friend Tom K., loves the printer. Not too mention, he's a Case worker/counselor who needed something he could rely on. Inkjets are nice, but they use the ink. Also if you don't use your inkjet often, the ink cartridges can drie up, and then you have to let it run test's, and that uses alot of ink. Although they do have alot of inkject printers today, that have better technologies, and the ink cartridges last alot longer."," I would like to get the brother HL Series HL-4040cdn Workgroup Up to 21 ppm 2400 x 600 dpi Color Laser Printer, or similar for myself.

I used the wireless connection, and configured it with a temporary wired connection, which the software uses to send the connection info to the printer, then you disconnect the cable, and move the printer wherever you like. The software on the CD made it quick and painless, steps you through the process (good if you're a beginner), and the printer was up and running in no time.

I suppose I'd average 15 pages a day, 7 days a week.  This is a guess.  I've had this printer for 15 months.  I exhausted the first toner cartridge in 4-5 months, if I recall.  Since then, I've been using a replacement full-size toner cartridge.  If I were to guess, versus my inkjet Canon printer (which I just replaced with a fantastic Brother inkjet), I've probably saved at least $250 in ink.  Offset this with the market value of the supplied toner and the replacement, full toner cartridge I bought for this laser printer, and I'd say I'm up $175.  Better yet, this think prints bloody fast!  Wireless config is a snap, and I've set this think up under OS X 10.5, Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Ubuntu.

Took some time to find the HTML ADMIN settings login to change the IP manually. Now it works like a charm. Which it came standards with the installation of the drivers.

If you've never had a little monochrome laser printer, get one of these and you'll wonder why you waited so long!! For the bulk of everyday printing tasks they are WAY faster & cheaper than an inkjet."," A little noisy when printing but it's done so fast who cares! Print to it and it wakes up, gets the job done, and shortly after it goes back to sleep. I can see how the network setup could be difficult for a novice.  The basic user manual doesn't help much with networking but luckily does mention something called the Network User Manual. If it isn't in the box or on the CD, do yourself a favor and get the Network User Manual from this printer's support page at Brother. If you like full manual setup do it by IP; if you like a guided version use the software... either way the networking manual will help IMMENSELY! It also explains how to access the status pages of the printer which have a ton of useful data; page count, error messages, toner life, drum life, sleep timer, firmware, etc, etc, etc."," I bought this printer locally for $99 on sale before Newegg had the same price. Most of our home printing is b&w and we were looking for a network printer to do b&w cheaper than an inkjet.  This fit the bill. Take note: there are just two buttons that run this printer; on/off on the side and a big white button on top that does a WHOLE bunch of things. If for no other reason, read the book about what this button does and how. I changed a wired setup to wireless by just hitting this button once at the wrong time and it took me a while to figure out what happened. Also, for the reviewer that spent $350 on toner/drums did you not read even the basic description with the printer?!? Toner ($40+/-) and drum ($70 +/-) are two different things. You can replace the toner cartridge many times before the drum needs to be replaced. The starter toner gave me about 1100 pages with the ""cover the eye"" trick. I then got a ""high capacity"" toner.

Regrettably HP dropped the ball on Win 7 64 bit drivers. While they are available the HP 1022 goes nuts when trying to share. I was impressed from the moment I installed this printer.

The wireless setup is fantastic, just follow the directions. This printer has paid for itself already. The cost of a set of ink cartridges was costing as much as this printer by itself.  The starter cart that came with this printer lasted quite some time.  Maybe for a thousand plus pages."," A few issues, not real big.  The single sheet feeder is a bit of a hassle to use, it has to be manually adjusted for each item size and is moderately picky about how loose or tight you set the guides. Large job duplexing will mess up because the paper doesn’t sit flat once printed, this printer tends to roll the paper once printed.

Further testing confirmed the networking hardware had failed.  This happened, of course, just shortly after spending $$ on a new toner cartridge.  Now, I have a nice, but relatively useless USB printer for my network. Guess I'll have to shop for a print server."," This is now the second Brother printer which has given me network problems.  Perhaps their cost-cutting efforts are implemented in the network hardware to keep the price down.  If you buy one and plan to network it, I suggest you get an extended service plan, and keep that in mind when doing cost comparisons.

For setup, I followed the base directions in the manuals, branching into the directions to connect via ethernet. Final setup was done via the web interface.Linux and Mac OS x users will not have to use the driver CD to install the printer. Works natively with CUPS, and visible through Bonjour.3 weeks later- I'm happy with my purchase so far.  Duplex works like a charm- no paper feeding errors of any type after 115 pages printed despite using 'copier weight' paper.  Overall- this printer handles the printing demands from 4 networked computers (windows, linux, and therefore Mac OS X) easily."," Power draw during printer warm-up can cause CFL style lighting to flicker while warming up. This problem will be more visible in older homes than in newer homes and businesses. Fan noise is audible, but in my experience the fan does not sound louder or quieter than other laser printers. (a loud fan may indicate a broken fan)No color (obviously). I;m looking for a 'wide format' printer to fill that need.The rollers are listed as needing to be replaced after 12000 pages. and cost the price of the printer!"," Default print settings should of include a ""Toner save - Duplex"" setting for best resource saving- but is mostly an after thought considering the user profiles that can be setup.If your router supports DHCP reservation (most do), use this feature to put the printer on a static IP. Otherwise unexpected problems may occur when either the printer or router gets turned off and on. This also works better than setting a static IP via the printer's web interface.",4,4
9SIA9JJ3H17350,28-113-545,8/27/2011 6:40:21 AM,ANTONY C.,PRetty good printer for basic use,5," The wireless is nice and works well, had to connect a pc via USB to initially setup the wireless on the printer itself, but once I did that initially, I did not have to have subsequent pc's wired to the printer to get the driver installed (even on the initial PC, I only had to be connected to get wifi setup on the printer. It was not until after I did that, that I actually installed the driver on the initial PC.  So I still didn't have to have that one wired to get the driver installed).  Full duplex printing without me having to reinsert the pages is nice.  And the form factor is good.  The tray sits inside the printer so I don't have to open anything when I want to start printing (some printers are like this and I hate it, but I think the trend is away from this).  I also like the dark color."," No real cons so far.  I only pad $80 + $2 shipping. Well, I do feel like ~$45 for the high capacity toner cartridge is a bit much.  $30 for name brand and $20 for off brand would be better.  But $45 for 2600 pages is not bad.  And that is what this printer is designed to be for:  day to day basic b/w printing.  And it is good for that. Oh I did at first have problems with the wifi and could not figure it out for about 5 mins.  But I had MAC filtering enabled on my wifi router.  So I just disabled it, and then once the printer was setup and connected to the router via wifi, I was able to read the MAC address of the printer thru the router's web interface, and then added that MAC to the whitelist, re-enabled MAC filtering, and presto...it worked!"," I updated the firmware on the printer itself, new firmware came out on 8/4/2011 (see the Brother website for info).  I was reticent to do this, but decided for it anyway.  I am sure it will make using off brand toner cartridges more cumbersome...but I do not know this for sure.  The price diff between Brother brand and Rosewill brand for the same high capacity cartridge (2600 page capacity) is about $45 and $30 respectively.  But the firmware update went smoothly, and I even did the firmware update over the air / wifi, which is a tad dangerous.  You should really update the firmware via a wired connection (USB or wired ethernet).",1,2

Wireless SUCKS.  I actually wrote a satisfying review back in January when I bought it cause I didn't have a need for wireless and now I do and it doesn't work right.  I have 4 desktops and 3 laptops with static IP addresses, this printer doesn't like static IP no matter what you do. I am cisco certified so I know what I'm talking about.  The second it goes to sleep, it will not wake up even if you send jobs to print. You have to turn it off and then turn it back on which after that it looses the network configuration and everything is on defaults even the IP address, which randomly starts with 169.*.*.* It has the latest firmware but I haven't noticed any difference from the old one. Stay away if you want a wireless printer."," Brother utilities are pointless.  The printer is connected to my home network and the utility that searches for un-configured printers will NOT detect the printer.

So, as soon as you get this thing, hook it up to your computer, install the driver, update the firmware, then run the wireless setup utility. Only 802.11 b/g.

Combined ownership is about 5 months.------It prints, decent toner life, easy setup-(1.10 firmware) Truly the only inexpensive value-value-packed network printer on the market I would recommend to any one needing a cost effective monochrome laser printer solution.  I dont enjoy setting up printers nor do i get jazzed up by print work orders, however the latest 2270DW by Brother is by far - tops!   This printer, hands down when comparing to samsung, hp and cannon plus a few others, is the easiest on Ethernet setup and wifi.  However Note: WITH the latest owners literature instruction book.   Install as P2P(if you have a router/gateway), update your firmware by downloading from Brothers website and your golden.   Duplex printing actually works!  All this including Ethernet and Wifi?  Amazing. Brother has come of age."," Wifi QOS, note also similar to other brands, still sucks.  grab a wireless print server from NewEgg if you really want this feature.

Firmware update easy, no need for TFTP client - download latest drivers and Brothers handy flash util while your at it.  Brother's Support website easy to navigate!

But I heeded the advice of others and purchased another one when I bought the printer.Duplex printing of pre 3 hole punched sheets is a challenge.  I was getting way to many jams.  After tweaking things a bit though, I can do so pretty regularly with only the occasion jam.  I ended up using some tape to keep the little ""guide"" things in the up position, and placed my paper with the pre punched holes on the opposite side (enable reverse print in the options, they print out just fine.)If you are planning on refilling the ""starter"" cartridge, be sure to get yourself a ""starter gear,"" as it does not have one.  Supposedly it's needed for the printer to see it as a new one.  They aren't that abundant, but I found one on the internets."," I purchased this item elsewhere, it was cheaper at the time.

Relatively quiet for a laserjet printer. No power issues found as others have said. Aftermarket toner cartridges and toner refill kits are available for much cheaper operation. Love the option to use USB, ethernet, or a wireless connection.", Prints a tad light for my taste. Haven't found a way to make the print darker yet. Online users manual is not very clear on tweaking print settings. Large square footprint might be difficult to find space for on your desktop. Takes up more space than my old inkjet printer., As far as the power usage and lights dimming issues. I think this is more of a function of overloaded and inadequate home power systems than the printer itself. I am an electrician and I have no issues with lights dimming. If you only have an already overloaded 15 amp circuit and tons of stuff plugged into it any additional draw is going to make your lights dim momentarily. Same issue with the UPS systems. If your UPS is barely large enough to power your existing equipment as most home units are of course it will bog down your system. This is no inkjet printer... Laserjets use more power when printing that is a fact of life.,3,3

Fortunately, you can adjust the printer settings so that it will continue to print without having to replace the toner cartridge.  It still complains, though."," If you let it, the installation CD will install its Print Monitor.  This is what displays the 'out of toner' and other messages.

Around 100 pages it would not print anything at all until I replaced the toner cartridge.I am fairly new to laser printers but the last few pages it printed before stopping were perfect whereas inkjets you could see the fading inks. Maybe it just knows exactly when its time to replace? Either way not an issue since Newegg has great prices on the 2600 page toner cartridge., The wireless setup can be a bit of a hassle but if you take your time and READ THE INSTRUCTIONS its simple.

Its a very nice looking little printer and fits in almost anywhere. If you choose you can still hard wire it via USB/Ethernet straight to your modem/pc. Duplex printing is sweet, saves paper and works better than expected. The printer also has a manual paper tray hidden behind the ""Brother"" emblem if you want to print a post card/envelope/ect.

To the people that say it is noisy I think all laser printers are noisy. The noise is certainly not an issue for me it is quiet enough and no noisier than my Canon inkjet.4) Love the flexibility of going either USB/ethernet/ wireless  in connection. I am using the ethernet option and it works great and the setup was a snap with the supplied setup CD.5) Nice looking unit very classy and sleek and square. 6) Firmware updates are a snap with the software supplied.6) Generic toner is available for much cheaper operation., 1) I do notice some very slight paper curling with #20 paper on the corners in duplex but it's not a deal breaker. I will try #24 paper next. There are some adjustments in the menu to fix that. 2) Wireless hookup can be a little daunting if you are not WIFI savvy. The directions are a bit unclear to me but there is an auto installation CD if you know how to use it.3) Footprint is a bit larger than my old inkjet printer so make sure you have room for it. It is more square and deeper than an inkjet., I have not had this long enough to comment on toner usage or durability but first impression is it's a winner. Some people claimed it made the lights dim. Well I am an electrician and if your circuit is only 15 amps and you have lots of stuff on it already sure it will dim the lights momentarily. That is more a function of your house wiring already being overloaded than this printer drain on the power. All laser printers use much more power than an inkjet not just the Brother. That is the nature of the beast. It does exactly what you want it makes high quality prints fast and cheaply. I was so sick of getting gouged for inkjet refills I decided to try this printer. I almost went with the Samsung 2525W but after seeing and using this unit I am very happy with my purchase. There is no after market toner yet that will work with the Samsung either.

I see people complaining about the power draw....laser printers inherently draw more power than inkjets by design. Most of the power goes into heating up the drum for transfer of toner. If your lights are dimming it's more a function of your overloaded poorly wired home electrical system than the printer. I'm an electrician take it from me. Refilling the old cartridges with toner is the cheapest way to get working cartridges. For about $16 you can easily convert your existing OEM starter cartridges to a TN-450 and get another 4500 pages. I've done it myself works great! As far as the noise issues....laser printers are noisy from my experience no big deal stop your nit picking! The inkjets I've had were noisy as well so what's the big deal?

I've printed on one side, both sides (duplex), labels (Avery 5260  laser) and envelopes.  For paper, I use Staples Multipurpose paper, which is good for both ink jet & laser printers.One reviewer said it was heavy?  Compared to what?  I think it's lightweight for a laser compared to the all-in-one ink jets I have/had.  Lightweight to business lasers.A few reviews complained the WiFi was hard to setup.  I'm an IT guy & found it was fairly easy, I think it took a retry at it scanning for it, but then found it.  I have the printer wireless to my LinkSys WRT54G wireless/wired router, then wireless to my Dell XPS M1530 laptop (Vista Home Prem 64-bit).  I also installed the driver on my Dell Dimension E521, Vista Ultimate 32-bit (wired to the router) and it installed.  I think I picked wireless setup.The reviews said the starter toner doesn't last long, so I bought the combo deal ($114) with the extended ton"," When the printer comes out of sleep mode, it blinks the lights in the room (split-second) & sometimes trips my UPS to go on & off battery for a second.  It pulls 495W when printing (per stats on the Brother site).  A friend said 495W at 120V translates into 4.25 Amps.  I have a home office in a converted spare bedroom, so it's a 20A circuit.  I also have an inkjet, Brother laser, laptop, and a few towers, though I normally would only use the laptop & sometimes one or two add'l towers.  I've been unplugging old equip., etc. in case that would help.I've moved the printer to other rooms (circuits) and noticed a split-second blink in lights when I turn the printer switch on...probably when the drum is spinning up, as a friend told me he read is common with lasers.  So I gather this model isn't the issue, as other brands/models do it too.I'm not marking this down a egg, because the price/features outweigh this.  I'm hoping it doesn't damage electronic equip. on the same circuit."," Printing envelopes took a couple of tries as I was used to my Kodak All-in-one ESP5 inkjet.  I used MS Word 2007 & according to the Word diagram on how to insert it, it printed different.  I don't see this as a con yet.  It might be Word's problem.  I may download the Avery free program to do future labels, their software is usually pretty good.The color of the printer is all black, while the photo shows gray & black.  I don't mind and think the all black looks nicer.  I installed (download or CD) the free Brother BRAdmin Pro 3 (and the Lite version on another PC), both show status of the printer(s), etc. on the network.  Nice tool.

I have a HP Photosmart C6280, that scans, prints on paper and photo size sheets. The scanner and software were great, but because of the photo tray, the scanner only held like 5 sheets of paper and it ALWAYS jammed. When it worked the photo printing was cool, but it jammed so much that I wanted to throw the printer against the wall.  Recently, I installed a friends HP printer, and it took forever (I think because HP tries to load so much bloatware). My office just bought another HP and it installed easier, but still took me over half an hour!So when looking for a replacement printer on NewEgg, I came across this Brother printer.  Literally installed in 2 minutes!  Small foot print, nice paper tray, and prints on both sides of paper automatically if you so choose.  Just started using the printer tonight, but love it so far!

Really this would be a fine product if Brother put any effort into drivers and support.," The Windows 7 drivers for this thing are buggy, and Brother support is some of the worst I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with. Current drivers can break the Windows print spooler, and level 1 (or 4 or whatever they call themselves on a given day) will leave you high and dry and try to send you to Microsoft or your OEM. Recently, after months of perfectly fine operation the printer stopped working randomly. Brother Support's solution was to tie my printer to a fixed ip, and then tell me to leave the printer on all the time. Apparently Brother doesn't give a *mild expletive removed by auntie newegg* about planet earth, or its customer's electricity bills."," If you, like myself, end up having to tie your printer to a fixed ip just set up a DHCP reservation on your router. You can then turn the printer off when you aren't using it.

Full print quality is excellent but not needed for most everyday jobs I do.  I set my printing protocols to get the maximum number of pages from the starter cartridge. I expect with the settings I have used, I will easily get 1000 pages from it, and I know someone who has already gotten 1160 pages from the starter cartridge using the same settings.  The high yield replacement cartridge rated at 2,600 pages will undoubtedly get a lot more pages than 2,600 pages, and for the quality, the price is okay by me.It weighs about the same as my old HP laserjet, but it feels less obtrusive due to its squat, square shape.

I hooked up the usb to it and windows 7 automatically installed it. I hooked up a ethernet cable to it and it automatically connected to the network. Running a program called WnetWatcher identified it's ip address on the network which I connected via the browser and loaded up the web configuration page. Alternatively, you can hold down the go button and it will print a configuration page on which it will list the printer's ip address. Wireless was then setup using the browser configuration page. Overall, very simple installation process.-Duplex-Low price-Fast printing"," -LOUD!Even if printing one page, the printer fan would stay on and hum for 15 minutes. I timed it, it stopped exactly at 15 minutes and than the printer would be dead silent. Going into the web configuration page allows you to set when the printer would go to sleep, the default is 3 minutes. Even if the printer is ""asleep"" the fan would continue to run for exactly 15 minutes before shutting off.-Power hogWhen the printer would resume from sleep, the lights would flicker. It's an intense power hog! The lights would only flicker during initial start up, continual running causes no problems, only after the printer goes to sleep and wake up the lights would flicker. I'm currently living on university campus so the wiring shouldn't be bad."," Due to the loud nature of the printer fan staying on for 15 minutes, I would not recommend this printer for anyone who wants a quiet office, or at least anyone who doesn't have a dedicated room for printing. As a college student, I seldom print. Combined with the low price point and excellent feature set, the 15 minutes of fan noise is bearable because I print once only every couple weeks along with the fact that the printer is under my bed  using wireless which lowers the sound.

Had this problem with both of the toner drums so far, so something here is low quality, the drums or the printer.- Does not print heavy papers or envelopes well.  An older laser printer of mine worked perfectly on these, but this one bends the heavy paper quite out of shape and the toner does not fuse properly, leaving bits of it crumbling off.  Envelopes are bent and sometimes printed incorrectly or at a slant.- Toner drums are expensive and not very high capacity for the price.  I understand these are not supposed to be heavy duty use units, but they seem to run out much more quickly than their anticipated ~3500 page capacity, seemingly within 1500 sheets, mostly text but a few graphics thrown in.

The back half of every standard envelope is horribly wrinkled so that I am concerned that it will even go through the sorting machines. In fact, I had a recent payment that I had to mail in lost and the cynic in me says that it was because the envelope was wrinkled and didn't sort properly. These problems occur even after manually adjusting the internal levers and opening all the feed/output trays--which if I had known that was going to be such a hassle, I would have probably just stuck with my old HP LJ 1100.",1,1

Handles large print numbers well.," May have to get back to you on that, but I hope not. :)"," Had a multi-page, 2-sided program to print that had to be done almost as soon as I pulled it out of the box. Handled over 100 pages (approx 70 sheets of paper) flawlessly. I needed it done and it did the job. Quickly.Based on an earlier model I own, I started by keeping the print batches small (approx 3 programs, or 12 printed pages at a time). It handled that and the last page was barely warm. Pushed it up to 5 programs and then 8 - it handled them all without a hick-up. The duplex mode is a beauty. I no longer have to wait for a batch of ten sheets to cool down, flip 'em, put them in the tray, print the other side and then repeat. For a multi-page 2-sided document, this has probably cut my production time down by 50% perhaps more. I'm not even mad that NewEgg dropped the price two days later. :)",None,None

The overall quality is rather cheap. The plastic body is too thin and it bends and moves much too easily.

I didn’t get any problems such as faded text; the printer just refused to do any more printing."," I’ve been using Brother printers for about 7 years and with this printer it seems they have moved into the whole “cheap printer/expensive cartridge” thing a little too much for my taste.

If you don't need this thing urgently, Newegg has it on sale every few months for around that great price."," The wireless functionality was an absolute pain for the first 6-8 months, because whenever the DHCP lease expired and it grabbed a new LAN IP, all of my machines had a heck of a time finding it in order to realize it was online. I constantly had to go into the printer's tools screen, tell it what IP it now has, and only then would it be found.This was resolved finally when I went to Brother's website and found this great little tool called ""BRAdmin Light"", which is software (Windows only) that lets you view and modify the advanced network settings of the printer itself. Once I got that, I was able to go in and easily set up a static IP for it (which is easy - my computers all ask for a specific IP from the router) and from then on, a few seconds after I turn it on (after it finishes its boot-up sequence), it is detected perfectly.Another small issue: it's annoying when asking about firmware updates. I run the update, it says it was successful, but then sometimes when I go to use it later, it asks to get that same firmware update again. It's a minor inconvenience, though."," Initial setup of wireless can be a little cumbersome. I figured it out, but novice users may have issue getting that functionality to work.It works fine with my PCs (Win 7 x64 and Win Vista x86), but my brother notes that it's very finicky with Linux (Ubuntu / Mint). He had to eventually install the drivers for another Brother printer (same series but not exact same model) in order for it to work, which makes his computer interface with the printer fine, except no duplex printing.",5,5
9SIA9JJ3H17350,28-113-545,1/28/2013 1:11:29 PM,jenny p.,LOVE my Brother 2270,5," I've had this printer for two years. Bought it on sale for less than $100, after discount codes at a store that rhymes with ""shmoffice pepo"" when it was new on the market.It is fantastic! I started couponing a few years ago and upgraded to a monochrome laser printer because the hp inkjet I had just couldn't keep up (not to mention the highway robbery prices I was paying for ink!!) The stock toner lasted me several months with heavy printing, an I've found toner replacements (off brands) for less than $10 that have lasted a 6 months to a year with heavy usage.*This printer prints clear. I only noticed when my toner was out that it got a little grody. New toner= crisp printing all over again.*It is fast.*I have had no mechanical issues other than a carriage jam here and there (to be expected)*I hadn't even realized it was a wireless model when I bought it. Our old computer had no wi-fi so i hooked it up manually. We just upgraded our PC and the instant wireless hookup was effortless! One less cord, yay! I love how it holds almost an entire ream of paper in the carriage. I never run out! *The single sheet feed is perfect for one sheet printing. I can send my scrap pieces of paper right through the front for printing, and I have virtually no wasted paper.* Sound is not too bad. I've grown to love the little warm-up sound it makes, it's not irritating and I know some good coupons are about to come out. I can count the sheets of paper coming through as each one whispers into the tray. Is that weird?This printer has made me a Brother customer for life!"," I can't figure out how to print booklets. It's probably a user error on my part. back to back printing has been a challenge. Again, me, not the printer. The paper whips around in there so many directions before it comes out that it's tricky to tell which way to place things to get them to align properly"," Hands down, best printer I have ever owned. I've told all my couponing friends to purchase the 2270. No regrets! It can handle heavy use considering 90% of my printing is in B&W and I need precise printing for all those tiny barcodes on my coupons!",2,2

Yet it is just as fast and quiet.  Print quality is excellent.  Duplex printing works without any hassles.  Networking works effortlessly once configured (see other thoughts).  Absolutely worth the money considering I spent roughly 8 times as much for the HP.," Starter toner.  I know this is done to help keep the purchase price down, but come one.  I would rather pay $10 more and not have to get a new toner after a couple weeks of buying the printer.  Note:  Newegg carries an inexpensive high yield toner for this model under the brand name Rosewill.  Have not used it yet but will review that as well.", This printer uses a separate drum and toner.  So you replace each separately and at different intervals.  This will take some getting used to compared to HP where they are both in the same cartridge (and with a much higher price).The networking is vastly different than HP JetDirect.  As such it took me a bit to figure out.  But each does things their own way so I cannot knock off an egg even for this.,2,2

I found others in the price range, but when you look at replacement toner cartridges, the Brother seemed to be the most economical. I purchased Brother laser printer products for organizations in the past and never had any problems, so I guess it was time to get myself one. This printer did not disappoint (just limited use though since ownership is about a week). I have an Linksys E3000 router and setup was UNBELIEVABLY EASY.  Took me no more than 5 minutes to set up 2 laptops.  I cannot testify to the ease of using any of the other methods, but if your router has the ""AOSS"" or WiFi protected setup ability, it couldn't be any easier.Kudos to Newgg also. Ordered the printer using normal delivery (free shipping) and had it 2 days.I would definitely recommend this printer to anyone looking for a low cost laser printer, and you wan't go wrong buying it from Newegg.",1,1

However, the current Linux (using Ubuntu and Mint) drivers, FROM the BROTHER support site, work barely some of the time. Most of the time it just spews pages ruined by a few characters. Closing everything out and reprinting the same range sometimes works - after you've turned off the printer and wasted the paper.

We replaced our HP 4M Plus, a workgroup workhorse, but very outdated, noisy and we were having too many issues.  Setting this up was a breeze!  It sits quietly and unobtrusively on its cart until its asked to do some work.  When a print job is sent, this little beast spins up and shoots out the print job in very little time.  Our HP used to take minutes to warm up.  We have this set to toner-save mode and the print is still very good.  Love the auto duplex printing.  Rarely to we need things printed only on one side.  Haven't used the feeder yet, but will have a better idea after we get out our Christmas letters and labels.  So far, we are very pleased!Setup was easy, using a cat5 connection (the same our retired HP used) and was easily discovered by the computers when adding a printer.  It was easiest to actually download the software from the brother website and install that way, but a no-brainer, even for the non-tech savvy.  My father-in-law was able to also install the device by searching for a driver on Windows Update, getting the new list of drivers and selecting the correct model.

That's probably a limitation from not having a full display, but still annoying.I want to say it ""just works"" once set up, but it does take some occasional fussing to keep the wireless working.

The price point is sweet, especially considering the generous feature set offered. Not only that, it's built with quality, and though I'm a computer tech, I have found zero trouble with any functionality. You can see the features on your own, and I think you'll be pressed to find a printer of this quality and with this wide set of features for similar price. The description says you can use AirPrint via an app, but I can vouch that no extra app is needed in iOS to AirPrint to this sucker. Just make sure Bonjour and Bonjour Print Services are installed on the machine hosting the printer and that's all she wrote. Comes with a ""starter"" toner cart, low yield… but I haven't come close to running out of toner yet (although I don't print heavily/daily)."," There really aren't any cons that I can think of. I have not experienced a single problem, mechanical or otherwise since I got it. The only two minor complaints are really technicalities and not real flaws. The first is the wireless is only B/G. While N is not really even necessary in a utility sense, if you're running a pure N-only network and want to use this wirelessly, you'll unfortunately have to accommodate for G, which could be an inconvenience.The second is inherent to all laser printers, not just this one… so again, it's not a product flaw; but the warm-up/print load pull (when starting up or printing, the wattage pull will spike tremendously, though temporarily), but it applies such a demand that my battery backup will trip momentarily.BTW, a tip for novces; do not plug a laser printer into a battery backup port. Use the surge only side. I will admit the electrician who did the wiring in this house did a terrible job, especially with grounding and proper distrobution, because at times my vacuum cleaner will trip the circuit breaker. But at peak load, this printer causes a quick power flicker and trips my battery backup, but I think that is the wiring problem more so than the printer."," If this is on sale for under a hundred dollars, it's a no-brainier.

I installed it successfully under Windows and OS X but it took some time. Note that if you run the driver installer under Windows it will actually also install your printer automatically, so once the driver is done check for your installed printers and Pantum should be there. No need for adding ports etc.The nice thing about the printer is that is has its own web panel for configuration, which is really neat. The only thing is that you need to know the IP of your printer first, in order to use it and getting this information isn't trivial. Also without the IP of the printer it it is nearly impossible to install it under OS X.", If you think that the printer will print out an information sheet with its MAC and IP address you are wrong. The 'print netweork configuation' option available from the installer only prints out available WiFi networks without any information about the printer. In order to get the IP of the printer you have to start the driver installer again and get is from the table showing printers. Once you do that you can install the printer under OS X typing in its IP address in the IP field for LPD.,,0,1

It arrived quickly and was shipped in the product packaging. Setup is very unusual for a printer, but should be no problem for someone who can read directions.The printer has a built-in access point and webserver (like most routers). Guests can connect directly to the built-in server to print, using a login/password. Windows users can use the software CD to set the printer up, but everyone else has to go the access point route for initial setup. It helps to download the manual from Pantum's website, as the documentation included with the printer was lacking.Print quality is not bad for the price. Having said that, this is definitely a better text printer than graphical printer. It's GDI (no on-board PostScript interpreter) so this is to be expected.Device compatibility:Set up and print worked well from Mac OS and iOS devices. Android users have to print from Pantum's app. It's very limited, allowing printing from only a handful of apps and document types. They should've gone with Google CloudPrint as a more versatile solution. Also, though the specs list Linux support, Pantum only ships CUPS filters and PPDs for Ubuntu.

The output is sharp and it's really quite a bargain."," On the downside, the driver installation on my work network throws an error about needing to be an administrator, even though I have admin rights on the PC and executed with ""Run as Admin"". I am not a domain admin on my network though and I wonder if it was getting confused. Looking in the printers list, it was there though it looked a little odd, and after doing an ""Update Driver"" and selecting the driver from the install directory manually, the printer worked fine. I had no trouble with driver installation on my home network.Additionally, the printer does something that's not really kosher - it creates an unsecured access point that is used by the mobile printing apps. I didn't find this in the documenation or the quick install guide. As far as I can tell, it's not a true access point that allows access to your network - you can only connect to the printer's web page, which by default is found at 192.168.223.1 - but it's still very bad behavior. From that IP or if you connect to the printer via the IP address your network has assigned, you can access a configuration web page from which the wireless AP can be disabled or a password assigned.  If you disable it though mobile printing with it's printing app doesn't work, even if the printer is on your wireless network. I couldn't get the Andriod app  to connect supplying the IP address the printer uses on my network.Finally, duplexing is manual and unfortunately streaked the very first time I tried it. I'm not sure if the toner wasn't quite dry and if I'd have better luck using different paper or not. Using the paper I have though I wouldn't duplex something unless I wouldn't mind a little toner streaking on one side.", For $30 you can't really complain too much. It's fast and cheap.,1,2

My workaround is to force-load sheets by releasing the spring-loaded paper tray plate, thereby pushing one sheet against the rubber pick-up roller. Not a workable solution.

It was knocking off my laptop to the internet when initially turned on. The culprit was the internal hotspot in the printer. It is turned on by default on the initial install. I don't need a hotspot and it should be an option to be turned on when installed. The hard thing was to turn it off. On my Vista OS you go to Control Panel/manage wireless networks. There, right click on the Pantum network and choose Properties and click on the Security tab. Uncheck  the box that says to automatically connect.  There is a downside to this. In order to get into the printer to change settings, you use your browser to enter the IP address of the Pantum printer. Just like getting into your router. Once you turn off your hotspot you cannot use your browser to get into the Admin Panel. You have to connect using the printer USB cable. .

I do not have it up and running on Linux yet.," Ubuntu does not equal Linux.  If you run large networks with RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, SUSE, openSUSE, or others there is no support or compatibility.  I called Pantum support US and they use a call center to handle all of their calls.  They said they would get back to me and I am waiting.  The graphic on the Newegg page needs to say Ubuntu comparable not Linux compatible.  If you work in a multiple system environment Windows, OSX, Linux avoid this machine and more important this company.  I have no problem setting up printers from HP, Epson, and even Lexmark, or even  because they provide the needed Linux support for all distributions or variations or links to where answers can be found.   Newegg (still the leader and always the best for providing support of Linux) will be getting a return on this product if I do not hear back from Pantum.   For any hardware company to confuse Ubuntu as the whole of the Linux universe is well....hilarious.   If you query Pantum.com you will see they use OpenSSL, Jumla, and Apache 2.4 to run their own servers.  These can be run on Linux or Windows but it shows that their own company is aware of Open Source software and tools and how to run those tools on large networks.  I ran Nmap on global.pantum.com and the result yelds that Pantum is running their website on Microsoft Windows 2003|XP.  That is right as of 15:43 hours on December 26, 2014 Pantum uses an operating system that is no longer supported to run open source tools to serve up their web pages.  It think I can now understand.....they may not have anyone using modern equipment to run networks.  Google nmap if you want to see how the program works to determine server OS.  Bottom line we want truth when you tell us what your printers are compatible with.  This is true no matter what the OS is....it could be Apple, Android, Chromebooks,Windows.  However if your web page is being served to the world on Windows XP in December of 2014 the technical knowledge at your (insert your favorite Chinese company name here) may be lacking good Linux support staff.", none,0,6

I got sick and tired of my HP inkjet printer which ""ran out"" of ink every few months. Which means I was paying around 50 bucks for less than 10 prints (given my print frequency). Someone told me that laser printers don't have this problem, that they will not ""dry up"" like that. I am skeptical but have decided to check the theory by purchasing a cheap laser printer.I am writing this review after just having set up my Pantum P2502W laser printer for wireless use from my Windows 8.1 as well as my other Mac OS X (Yosemite, 10.10.5) laptop. There was a scare at the beginning of the setup (after I unpacked and installed the toner cartridge) as the second LED light (with the exclamation-inside-a-triangle icon) was showing a stable orange which the manual said was ""Cartridge error (not installed, mismatch, expired)"".  One of the Pantum representatives replied in a different customer's complaint (http://www.newegg.com/Product/SingleProductReview.aspx?ReviewID=4262924) that cleaning the toner chip (it is on the right side of the toner and has 3 or 4 golden squares in a row) with a soft cloth should fix the problem. That did the trick for me too.As for the wifi setup, I followed the excellent but somewhat technically involved instructions at another online retailer's website (search for ""Good printer with difficult setup"" by Ray Z dated Aug 19, 2015).I was able to get both my Windows 8.1 and Mac OS X printers printing via Wifi. The print quality seems great.Note that I have used this printer for all of 1 day. I don't know how long it will last. So, my 5 stars is for the initial impressions.",1,2

Easy to connect to both of my computers running windows 10," Instructions are terrible, if you aren't an intuitive person, you might not be able to set this up.Downloading the drivers from the website works, but your average computer user won't be able to do it since it comes in a rar file and you have to look for the set up in there but from there, it's simple but not for the average computer user. I had to install it by first setting it up so it recognizes our wireless system and runs off of it, then I had to connect all my devices to it wirelessly in separate installation processes. It's not difficult but you have to figure it out yourself.In order to actually print, you need a decently thick stack of paper in there otherwise it's going to suck up multiple sheets and jam."," This printer has no security.

Ummmmm YES PLEASE. At that price tag for what you are getting in regards to functions is crazy to pass up on. Even, never having owned an Pantum device or not even knowing much (nothing) about the company, this was definitely a great gamble to take. Even if the printer fails in a year, it still would pay for itself.This thing was easy to set up and get connected to my wireless network. I used the included CD. I had it unpackaged and connected to the network in about 15 minutes. The drivers installed flawlessly and I printed my first few test pages effortlessly.

What I have to say is, follow the instructions. Install the drivers first, then connect through USB, go through wifi setup using the CD again and you are all set. Their website sucks so if you don't have a cd drive try to copy the content into usb somewhere else. As long as you install the provided driver it should be straight forward to setup the wifi. Setting wifi for iPhone is also very easy. Didn't try android though.Double sided printing is not hard but not trouble free. The printer prints 2,4,6,8, etc first, then you need to take out all papers and flip them into the tray to print 1,3,5,9 again. Literally you just need to flip the paper and refeed it to the tray, but it takes trials to get used to the right orientation.Otherwise the printer is perfect for me so far, much better than the Epson cheap wireless ink printer I bought.",0,1

You cant beat its price, especially when its on sale (which it currently often is)- Feels to have a very solid build- WiFi- Easy to setup- Low footprint driver"," - Very long delay for first printout.  It takes a long time to get warmed up from sleeping (you can change the time before it sleeps in its web interface - 1,5,15,30 or 60min)- Even when the printer is not sleeping large print jobs (as in data wise - pictures etc) take a long time to start printing.  Im not sure if this is due to wifi or a slow processor in the printer or a combination of both.- Once you open its paper and output tray, its compactness disappears.  It has basically the same footprint as the value offerings from other printer manufacturers.- Surprisingly loud- Small starter cartridge, and new cartridges can cost more than the printer"," Pro and con at the same time:This printer has a very surprisingly strong/aggressive paper feed system.  You could probably put in a piece cardboard and it would print on it and spit it out.  I accidentally left a bag of gummi worms on the paper tray and printed something… and the printer picked it up!  (jammed of course)  It made it past the drum and part way into the fuser.  I was shocked (and impressed)  The reason this can be a con is the printer seems to curl the paper a lot more than other printers (all laser printers do this to at least a tiny degree)Why 5 stars with all the cons?  The value is simply unbeatable/amazing.  I also was trying to be very thorough.Toner cartridges are still expensive and I haven’t seen any evidence of generic (counterfeit basically) chips.At first I was bummed missing out on a sale of a generic toner, but quite frankly, even its sale price was too much for me for replacement toner.  Having the drum as part of the toner cartridge does make them more expensive, but I buy generic canon toners with drums in them all the time for a fraction of the price of this printers toners.Im really hoping that Newegg is selling a ton of these printers, and continues to do so in the future.  The likely reason we dont see generic chips or more generic cartridge offerings is its just not worth it because there are so few of these sold compared to hp/canon/brother etc.I ordered 5 of these printers.  I have only deployed one but here is what I did:  I ordered the generic toner kit from another online company (200 grams) and filled up the starter cartridge BEFORE pulling the protective tape and paper cover on the drum.  This really reduces the risk of degrading the cartridge.  (you never want to touch the drum, and toner could get places it shouldnt.)  I filled the hopper pretty full - Im guessing about 80% of its total capacity (I kept looking inside with a flashlight as I filled it)So the question will be: how many prints will I get?  I bought these printers for low volume areas because.. well because they are low volume printers.  Its total page count is only 67 ATM, but it does say 100% remaining (if you hold cancel/resume for a few sec it prints out a demo page and 2 pages of settings etc including page count and remaining toner)  I guess time will tell as I get more page counts and the remaining toner counter starts to fall.",1,2

I remember thinking it was probably too good to be true at this price point -- and it was.Printer arrived and was okay to set up out of the box. However, software and driver installation for Wifi set up was confusing at best. The included printed materials were useless. I had to use instructions as posted online by other user reviewers in order to get the printer on the wifi. Turns out you need to hook up the printer by USB cable first, then run the wifi setup utility to send the printer the necessary instructions to get it on the wifi. There is no clear explanation of this in the printed materials. Additionally, the auto-detect feature doesn't work--you have to manually specify your wifi SSID and passcode.After going through the anguish of figuring this all out, I finally successfully got my printer on my wifi network. ONLY to be even more disappointed when the printer grabbed the first sheet and jammed. I cleared the jam per the instructions... and tried again... Paper Jam. I tried three more times, the printer constantly jammed--every time. I never was able to get even a single page to print. Finally gave up and called the Pantum support phone number. Got through to someone who asked some VERY BASIC questions about the lights and checking the connections. Afterwards they said ""Okay I'll submit this to have support call you back"".... Geez I thought I just called support but I said ""okay"" and they said they would call me back no later than 24 hours.Well 24 hours came and passed. Eventually the second day an email arrived telling me it was within the 30 day return period and I should send it back to newegg.Then I had to go through the whole process of chatting with a newegg agent, getting two RMAs issued (one for the printer and one for a toner cartridge I ordered) ... and newegg doesn't want to take back toner but I finally got an exception after several chat sessions. Now here I am, after all this time and trouble, getting ready to ship this printer back.

And, I might add, surprisingly robust and well built.I used an old Windows 7 clunker to run the CD to set up the wireless.  I suppose I could have used Wine for linux to do the same.I have x86 and x64 laptops running 14.10 and 15.04 Lubuntu.  Downloading the drivers from pantum.com, extracting the compressed file, finding the x86 or x64 .deb and running it, added the drivers I needed.  I then ran the ""Printers"" app from within ""System Tools""(I'm using LXDE and OpenBox, first installing the Printer via USB with the locally detected instance provided me by the drivers.  I printed a test page.  Then I changed the device URI->Find Network Printer->Typed in IP address in Host.  The wizard then finds the device and port(9100).  Apply and test print again, this time after disconnecting the USB cable and voila.Note:  One laptop unexpectedly already have the same driver loaded.  As is stood, however, the Print Test page was grayed out.  So, I deleted the printer and installed the .deb from Pantum's side and proceeded as prior with success.Note-the drive from the manufacturer's website says for Ubuntu 12.04, but it works just fine for 14.04/14.10/15.04 .The web admin page is pretty run of the mill, but still offers some nice features at the price.  Email notificaitons for various alerts, basic control of all your protocols(you can turn off all the protocols you are not going to use and keep the noise from your network)One tip.  Though I have not noticed it, some have written that turning off the HotSpot feature, helped out some of their network issues.  Mine has been perfectly stable though.Overall, this printer offers one big bang for the buck.",2,3

Newegg was running a special on this Pantum Laser Printer for $30 shipped to home along with a $20 Shutterfly Gift Coupon - total end cost for the printer + $10!! How could I pass this by? I ordered just one. I wish I had ordered 5, the maximum allowed. It arrived quickly, unpacked and plugged in even quicker. My Samsung Galaxy SIII found it immediately and printed out a beautiful (monochrome) test page. My wife's iPhone 5 did the same.

We needed a printer for our home office, but didn't have a lot to spend.  I found this printer (ended up being around 50 or 60 after a rebate), and newegg gave us free 2day shipping.  I think it was a steal!  It's affordable for what you get even at fullprice.  It's speedy (after a brief warmup), easy to use, and I'm happy that it connects with USB, since (even though it did not come with one) I have a million around the house from previous electronics.Also, it arrives with toner!!  (Admittedly it is not a full toner cartridge, so it won't get you superfar--but ours lasted several months, and several hundred pages at least)."," Toner can be expensive, as other reviewers have noted.  But, given how infrequently we print, I'd rather have a cheap printer with expensive toner than vice versa.  Others who print more frequently might prefer a different model.Also, the printer stopped working after about 5 months.  Luckily it was still covered by the 6-month manufacturer warrantee (DON'T FORGET ABOUT THAT!!), so they shipped me another one using free 2day shipping, and all I had to do was put the broken one in the box provided and ship it back (also free).  It was very easy.  And, I should say, it seems like the reason it broke was my fault--I didn't have it plugged into a surge protector.  However, the lovely people at Brother did not hold that against me.  So perhaps this isn't really a con for this printer after all."," One time it seemed like it was broken--kept telling me to clean the corona wire, which I did, over and over, to no avail.  However, it turned out all it needed was new toner.  That is an unfortunate glitch, however--don't give up on the printer!!  Just get some more toner.

Most printers don't come with DATA cables anyway so this was no surprise... luckily I had several extras in the basement.2> A small, narrow vertical line near the right side of the page appeared on about the first 25 pages I printed then it went away... I guess the drum had to wear in or something.3> It is a bit noisy and takes a while to 'warm up'.  If you have used a laser printer before, you'll understand that this is normal for this, but if you've only used inkjets in the past it may catch you off guard.  Takes about 20 seconds to print that first page, but then each page afterwards spits out about one every other second.", One other thing to note... the only connection is the USB port.  A network port would have been nice but for the price I happily network it through the computer it's installed directly onto.

Saw a number of comments regarding the ""empty toner"" issue.See the review on the refill tn330 here at new egg statingTo solve the End of life for the toner, take a little piece of tape (cannot be clear tape) and cover over the little circular window on the right side of the cartridge.", hope this works for everyone, Now I might buy it,2,2
9SIA0AJ3396501,28-113-290,3/8/2009 11:33:37 AM,Jason L.,"Great Printer, Amazing Price",5, Picked it up when it was on sale for 49.99 and I have to say what a bargain. This is a great printer for home users who use it for non photo printing., When I finally do need toner I'm going to have a hard time justifying paying almost as much for a cartridge as I did for the printer.," I've used laser printers at work but this is the first one I've used at home. If you ask me this pays for it's self with the starter cartridge. The starter cartridge allows you to print 1000 sheets, that's 2 reams. Meaning: This cartridge will last me 2 years probably. Plus I don't have to waste expensive ink on cleaning cycles (which never help anyway). It also saves paper because I'm not wasting so much on unreadable prints from an ink jet. If you are not printing photos, or color, as cheap as this is there is no reason to still be using an inkjet. Not only is this printer more economical but the print quality is better, what more could you ask for?",None,None
9SIA0AJ3396501,28-113-290,2/27/2009 4:39:41 PM,Anonymous,Super printer & bargain!,5," Clean crisp printing, water-resistance, flexible print options, small footprint, terrific bargain.", Cannot think of any," I am so impressed with this laser printer which I got for 49.99 on sale here. The output looks great & you can adjust resolution, toner density, and even put it in toner saver mode! The printer only makes noise while printing  ... in standby mode, it is completely silent. I do not have the issue that some have of the lights dimming. I live in an apartment with old wiring & have it plugged into an extension cord, and have had no problems. I tested a page and it is also waterproof -- unlike inkjet printers. And I don't have to worry about clogged printheads which I've had with my Canon inkjet. I will be looking into the toner refills someone mentioned in a previous review. This should bring down the cost of each print to pennies, especially if used in toner saver mode.  Even if you don't get this printer at the sale price, it seems like it would be a good deal. Oh, and Newegg's shipping as usual was super fast. Got it overnight with free shipping during the sale.",1,1
9SIA0AJ3396501,28-113-290,2/26/2009 8:25:57 AM,Vincent L.,Performs as advertised,5," Much faster print time/page compared to my 5 year old HP desk jet, great quality/sharp looking printed documents, easy to setup and install, saving money on toner, super fast shipping"," Have to switch on the printer manually before printing now, minor paper curl", Overall this is a great quality printer.  It is quick to setup and easy to use.  I picked up 2 of them while they were offered on sale in late February.  Very satisfied with this purchase.,None,None
9SIA0AJ3396501,28-113-290,2/26/2009 8:20:46 AM,Harry G.,So far so good...,5, Does what it is supposed to do (prints sharp b&w documents quickly and economically).," None.  I may have had a con if I hadn't bought it on sale, even though at original price it still pays for itself rather quickly."," Both being students, my fiance and I have been blowing through inkjet cartridges like they were going out of style.  So I made this pretty Excel spreadsheet showing cost comparisons between my Photosmart 7660 and this printer with both the regular and high yield cartridges, including the cost of paper.  Yeah, I was really bored.  At the current price ($114.99) it will take 8 reams of paper to break even with the TN330 regular cartridge and only 7 with the high yield TN360.  I got this from Newegg on sale for 49.99 requiring only 4 and 3 reams respectively until it starts saving money.Besides being more economical, I'm really appreciating the speed of laser printing.  Compared to 12ppm on the inkjet, this puppy is spitting out documents in nearly half the time. Tired of stimulating the economy through the ink industry?  Keep that dough in your wallet for better (more important) stuff by getting this printer.",2,2
9SIA0AJ3396501,28-113-290,2/24/2009 3:40:49 PM,Wayne W.,Fantastic for the Price !!!,5," Less than the cost of 2 inkjet cartridges! Easy to setup; installed, and added to all 4 PCs in my home network in less than 30 minutes, including a test page on all machines. Excellent text quality. Although I bought this printer for text use, I had to print a couple of photos just to see how they were handled. These monochrome images are handled as well as any other more expensive mono lasers. Printing speed leaves my old TI Microlaser in the dust, not to mention my Epson inkjet. The driver also includes many more options than I thought a low price laser would have. There are 3 different resolutions, a toner saver option, reverse  print, 10 different selectable media types, manual duplexing, and watermarks, just to name some of them. Sometimes you don't get what you pay for; but in this case, with the 2140, I think I got MORE than what I paid for! (Don't tell Newegg, they might raise the price.)", I hould have ordered one sooner...," Ordered Saturday night, shipped by Newegg on Monday, received Tuesday; what else can I say about Newegg. I will comment on some of the other reviews. Several people were disappointed that a USB cable is not included. I have been a computer professional for over 25 years. I have purchased over 300 printers in that time. I have NEVER seen a cable included with a printer.Some people complained that they were worried about their UPS or surge protector when the printer starts up. Hey people, do not ever plug a laser printer into a UPS or into the same circuit with the computer !!! They all use a lot more juice than an inkjet. The only thing I know of worse than that was a client of mine years ago who blew out the UPS for his server, and brought down his network. He thought it would be a great idea to run an extension cord from the UPS to the breakroom fridge, so in case of a power outage everybody's lunch would be saved. Need I say more...",1,1

What a deal on a great little laser.,5," Well, the obvious caveat here is that this is not a printer that is designed for high volume service.  In a home or small business where the printer is used as Brother suggests, you will be rewarded with fast delivery of clean and crisp documents, day after day.  As a bonus, the toner cartridge that comes with the printer can be refilled to the high-volume TN-360 cartridge spec.  With a little looking around on the net, you'll find several places where you can buy the toner and required ""Reset Gear"" kit... for well under $20.  With a couple of 2000+ page refills under your belt, and the saved money in your pocket, you'll be very glad you chose this quick little printer.", None," OK, so when the printer starts a print job, it may startle the cat that was snoozing on top.  The print process is a little noisy.  However, the start-up, print and return to sleep cycle is very short.  When sleeping, the printer is stone quiet and using very little power.",1,1

Best of all I haven't replaced the toner cartridge yt. The price was amazing. I got mine from newegg for $49.99 on special. I also just bought the upgrade to it from newegg.

Quality drivers available for Linux from manufacturer.", Not all types of paper will work.  Linux drivers make printing non-standard (ISO) paper or envelope sizes difficult but you can still get the job done.  The lights dim when printer warms up or is printing... but there is a hard switch on the side so you don't have to leave it on standby., Tried to print wedding invitations using a kit purchased from Target.  Either the thickness of the paper or the type caused ghosting to occur.  All other paper prints cleanly and flawlessly.  If you are a linux user make sure you install drivers from the manufacturer.  The drivers detected in the Ubuntu repository doesn't work and the workaround doesn't provide as many options as you get if you install it yourself.,2,2

Software installed without any problems and has printed efficiently from the day I bought it.," There isn't a control panel type screen. (Don't know what its called). If the printer has the error light on, then you're left to try and find the error on your own, but so far its been something easy to figure out (out of paper, toner, etc).Didn't come with a USB cable to connect to the computer, but luckily I had one lying around.

We use Brother products at my office and before we could get quite a bit out a cartridge even after it said low/empty.  With the new printers, when it hits a certain page count, its done...no more.
