The Western Digital Portable is operating as expected, maybe even better. Although I will be getting a replacement drive from Seagate it will never see the inside of my machine. Instead, it will go into an external enclosure. I've decided to use the Western Digital Scorpio Black WD7500BPKT 750GB for my internal storage drive, primarily because it has a 5 year warranty, as opposed to Seagate's 2 year warranty.

It is limited by the speed of the physical drive itself rather than the USB 3.0 bus speed. It also includes the necessary USB3 cable to connect to your computer or laptop.In real world testing (transferring music, game files, text documents, jpeg images and CANON RAWs), I had around 65 MB/sec write speed. Smaller files will have a slower transfer rate (around 20-30MB/sec), but if you transfer rather large files (1GB+), you will see speeds reach past 100MB/sec.The build quality is very high, and the rubber feet on the bottom have good grip and eliminate all vibrations emitted by the drive.Software:Included on the drive are some software and manuals to get you set up for Mac and Windows. Together they are called WD Apps.The primary software, named Drive Utilities, can check the S.M.A.R.T. diagnostic information, run a two-minute self test, and can do a complete drive scan to check for bad sectors. You can also set the timer for when the drive shuts off while plugged in. Default is 30 minutes but you can increment it up to 90 minutes for time limits or just make it always stay powered up. You can even erase your drive from the Drive Utilities app. The other software included are WD Security, WD QuickView and WD SmartWare.WD Security is the app to set a password lock and will encrypt your drive for you.QuickView is a neat system tray icon that quickly displays all connected Passport drives with their name, usage, security status, and if the drive is at a stable temperature.WD SmartWare allows you to set up and customize automatic backups and see what’s on each partition."," The white LED can be bothersome (very bright) if not covered at night. IT is small enough (2mm) to easily be covered. Otherwise, it’s aesthetically pleasing to see.The only other con I find is that this drive costs on average $10 more than the competing drives. If price is a factor for you, then look elsewhere. This will not deter any loyal fans however."," I have been using this drive daily for over a month now and am quite satisfied with its reliability.This drive will fit in the average pocket albeit slightly larger than the average cellphone.

The progress bar would freeze halfway there and refuse to budge.  Attempting to cancel the file transfer would freeze my entire computer, calling for a complete manual shut down. So I tried to contact Cirago technical support. For two days I got the answering machine.

9SIA22F56X2126,22-236-893,10/21/2015 11:12:56 AM,Brian S.,Good drive unless there's an accident,3," This is a 2.5"" external hard drive from Western Digital, arguably the best hard drive manufacturer there is. This drive supports a very high level of encryption so if you're storing sensitive data where security is a big concern this is what you want to look for. If security isn't a realistic concern for you, or you know you won't want to enter a password every time you want to access your device, then you can get similar drives without the encryption and save yourself some money. It's small, looks modern and is easy to use. WD includes free software and diagnostic tools for their drives which can be very helpful.3 year warranty, much longer than most external hard drives."," In order to make the enclosure as small as possible they remove the standard I/O board from the hard drive. What this means is, basically, that you can't take the hard drive out of it's case and put it in a computer. Now, it's an external drive so that's fine, right? Wrong. If anything happens to the drive, if it fails in any way you won't be able to recover the data off the drive. If the USB port gets damaged in any way, you won't be able to access the information on the drive. Could be from fallingor something as simple as accidentally leaning on the USB cable damaging the pins. When external hard drives fail what you do to recover the data is remove it from the case and connect it to a computer with a SATA to USB adapter and then run yourrecovery suite. This is also how you recover data from an external drive with broken USB port. This lack of ability to troubleshoot is a big problem and a deal breaker for me.It's an external hard drive, it's primary purpose is to BACKUP data. If the backup isn't reliable then it's useless. If it can't be recovered in a failure then it isn't reliable.In fairness, as long as the USB port is undamaged you can still attempt to recover data from a failed drive. However recovery of data from a crashed hard drive is an inconsistent procedure, it's less reliable over USB than it is over SATA. Those internal headers are really important!Let me be very clear, if anything happens to that USB port EVERYTHING on that drive is gone forever. That is an unacceptable risk."," Performance of this drive isn't spectacular but it isn't bad either, it's exactly average.My average read speeds were 78MB/s. Average write speeds were 62MB/s transferring 138GB consisting of every file type imaginable. There are faster drives out there.Seagate still makes external drives with the internal headers intact, so I strongly recommend looking at their product offerings. I want to give this drive 1 star because of the removal of internal headers, but the likelihood of one of these ""catastrophic failures"" is low enough that doesn't seem fair.I'm giving it 3 stars because this drive is incredibly average. The company, support and software is spectacular, which would make it 5 stars. But then the lack of internal headers brings us back down to 3 stars, wiping out the advantage WD brings just by being WD.",22,25
9SIA22F56X2126,22-236-893,10/15/2015 10:04:29 AM,Matthew H.,Excellent External Hard Drive,5," +Compact - This is barely larger than a 2.5"" laptop hard drive, which I suspect is what is housed within.+Extremely Easy to Use - Just plug it in and you're ready to go.  If you choose to install the associated software it is located on the drive itself and is easily installed from there, albeit entirely optional if you just want to store files on it.  The software is also very simple to setup and use.+Responsive USB 3.0 Interface - My PC's recognize this drive very quickly and file transfers initialize instantly.  Overall performance is still limited by the mechanical nature of the drive, but it is otherwise very responsive.+Storage Size - For the price and physical dimensions of the device it's amazing how much storage capacity it has.+Sleek, Simple Appearance - The top is gloss white with a matte white/gray placard.  The sides and bottom both have a light gray matte finish, the sides being slightly less matte than the bottom.  There is a tiny white LED that shares a side with the USB port and blinks to indicate drive activity.  Personally, I would prefer the LED to be on the opposite side, as the 'port' side naturally points away from me.+Vibration Reduction Feet - 4 rubber feat should keep vibration from transferring to/from the drive.  The feet also do a good job of keeping the drive from sliding around on slick surfaces.+Quiet - Only with my ear pressed up against it was I able to hear a slight hum as data was being transferred.+Western Digital - I have more experience with Western Digital than probably any other computer component manufacturer.  My first hard drive was a 3.5GB WD back in the mid 90's, and in total I have owned 19 WD drives over the years.  I have only experienced premature problems with 2 of them and WD's warranty process was one of the simplest and most painless I have experienced."," -Speed Bound by Mechanical Drive - In the first moments of a file transfer you will see the potential speed of the USB 3.0 interface.  I saw transfer rates over 300MB/s for the first second or so.  This, of course, is information being transferred over the USB 3.0 interface (fast) and between buffers (very fast, volatile type memory, like RAM).  As soon as the data reaches the mechanical drive mechanisms (slow) you will be bound by the mechanical drive performance.  Most of my file transfers averaged around 35MB/s, which is about what I would expect from an average 2.5"" mechanical laptop drive.  This is normal and should be expected from this type of drive, but it should be pointed out that the USB 3.0 branding is not an indication of overall performance, although it does help and successfully removes the bottleneck that would be USB 2.0.-Tiny USB cable - Measuring roughly 18 inches long, the cable is just long enough to plug the drive in under normal circumstances.  This might actually be preferable for use as a travel drive to not have a long tangled cable to fuss with on the road.  For my home use, however, it would be nice for it to be longer."," I transferred a variety of media files to and from the drive (about 100GB total) and experienced very consistent performance.  Transfers to and from the drive both averaged almost exactly 35MB/s.  Playback of HD Media content on the drive was responsive and I was able to scan, skip chapters, fast forward, etc.. without any noticeable delay.Between cloud storage, seemingly endless web-mail inbox capacity, USB 'thumb' drives, various NAS solutions, and massive internal PC hard drives, there is simply no shortage of modern data storage options these days.  Given all of those options, the role of the trusty external hard drive has not diminished.  If you require secure, portable, offline, massive storage, then this is precisely the type of product to fulfill those requirements.  Nothing else currently accomplishes those tasks as well as a drive like this one.I have experienced no issues with this model and would gladly recommend it to anyone who is in the market for an external drive.",3,3

It was just slightly warm.  Also, it was very quiet.

Most of my usage has been writes only which has been getting about 140MB/s transfer rate (from internal SSD). The internal drive is 5400RPM and runs very cool at 22C. The case itself is very rugged, but I'm not inclined to be testing the waterproofing or shock features. However, I do occasionally take it with me in my soft laptop bag and I like the idea that it sustain a lot of force.

N82E16822301018,22-301-018,9/18/2015 9:13:57 AM,Debashish S.,Rugged little portable HDD,5," This portable hard drive is quite a little package packed with tons of ruggedness keeping the hard drive safe from falls and water. For a portable hard drive I look for first and foremost portability, performance and how well it can sustain regular day-to-day handling/mishandling. This hard drive lives up to all of these three parameters described above. Silicon Power being a small company should not be taken lightly as they have been making hard-drives & memory components that are on par with other major brands.1. Portability: This 2TB HDD is well packaged in a shock-proof, dust & water-proof casing that is made to withstand up to 3m drops and 300kg stress tests. In order to achieve all that and remain portable is a challenge but has been accomplished very well by the outer casing design. A tine space on the side of the HDD is reserved for a 4” USB 3.0 cable, which means no lugging around extra bulk in the backpack or no forgetting the cable to connect the HDD.2. Performance: This HDD packaged inside is 5400 rpm spinning laptop 2.5” HDD with a SATA 600 transfer mode and USB 3.0 interface. Transfer rates measured by ATTO and CrystalDiskMark are ~140MB/sec for both read and write processes. Comparing this to other USB 3.0 interfaced spinning HDD that I own this controller has over 40% performance boost. For a layman who performs regular backups, this should be a plenty sufficient. For gamers and SSD owners this is not that great performance for comparison, but it would be unfair comparison as this is meant to be a huge walking library of personal files and not the primary HDD for OS and gaming.3. Ruggedness: I have dropped it unintentionally three time from ~ 1m/3ft, where this has survived blunt falls with no effect in its performance. The outer casing looks like it is made up of aluminum alloy with shock proofing between it and the HDD. There are no openings for ventilation except for the USB interface to be consistent with the waterproof claims. A small rubber like material covers this USB interface for water proofing that port which needs to be opened for inserting the included cables.4. Space/Price: The current pricing of ~$0.0525/GB is very reasonable cost for a portable HDD with tons of extras as mentioned above. Comparing to other major portable HDD manufacturers this is a steal for your money. Don’t be put off by Silicon Power as having smaller market space in the computer memory sector as they are the next disrupter for cheap memory for great performance.5. Warranty: 3 years warranty on a portable hard drive exceeds similar offerings from major manufacturers on desktop HDDs.", Size: The size is slightly larger than other portables HDD by 10mm in terms of width and length and by 5mm in terms of thickness. Again this extra space is smartly taken up by the excellent padding to the HDD giving it its ruggedness. I think I will be easily able to compromise this small size differential to its survival for many years of ownership. One must also note that this has a compartment for a USB 3.0 cable that tucks conveniently on one side.,,2,2

N82E16822301018,22-301-018,9/8/2015 10:55:24 PM,Michael W.,Disclaimer: Free sample for review,5," The blue shell you see in the photos is billet aluminum carved into a one-piece shell, sand-blasted, and anodized. Very nice texture to it and since it's sand-blasted instead of brushed it won't show oily fingerprint stains. Wipe it clean every now and then and it'll always look as good as the day you got it.Opening it reveals how almost perfect the water-resistant seal is with one exception I'll go over in the cons. The seal goes all the way around the interior housing on both sides leaving no chance of water getting through aside from the possible exception afore mentioned.Not an SSD, but for these volumes you would not expect that. The model tested as the review header should show is the 2TB model which is very fast for a HDD, especially a 2.5"" HDD.Shock pads surround the HDD effectively, a nice soft rubber with plenty of flex and compression to it in every possible direction.Most surprising of all is the USB3.0 to SATA Data/Power circuit board and chip are well optimized. Easily surpassing most USB3.0 flash drives out there for sequential speeds which is amazing. This would make an excellent on the go drive for recording 1080p video, or at least transcoding from the recording drive to this on the fly. Let these CDM benchmarks justify that:USB3.0 500MB 5-pass Read / Write in MB/s:131.5 / 130.9 Sequential42.21 / 62.56 512K Random0.491 / 1.561 4K Random0.562 / 1.570 4K Random Queue-Depth 32USB2.0 500MB 5-pass Read / Write in MB/s:31.59 / 34.78 Sequential22.36 / 34.36 512K Random0.479 / 1.522 4K Random0.526 / 1.544 4K Random Queue-Depth 32Also comes with a 2' long USB3.0 M/A to M/A aside from the 2"" one shown on the side."," There are two key faults in this design. The first is the afore mentioned fault with the water seal. The only way I can see water getting in is through the USB port. Now this port has a rubber cap that fits rather snuggly inside the port. If there was some kind of snapping or locking clamp involved then that port cap wouldn't worry me at all. However the cap is made of the same soft rubber used for the shock pads around the drive and is very snug in that port. I wouldn't intentionally test it's ability to prevent water getting into the enclosure, but it should offer at least the protection described.The other fault I'm concerned with is the material used for the side covers. It's not a brittle plastic, but it is plastic. It'll certainly crack and/or break with sufficient force, but should survive the kind of impact described."," Now combine the two cons and you have the potential that if the drive were dropped on the side with the USB port cover into a puddle on the side of the street; you could very well crack the side cover, dislodge the port cover, and water splashes in. Dead drive? No... it's not powered. Open up one side, put it all in a ziplock bag with a piece of bread on top and set it in a closet or other confined place with a small heater running for about 8 hours. The warmth will evaporate any water that got on the circuitry as well as around the drive itself. The bread will absorb the evaporated water. Now you should go over the circuitry on the board and the drive for debris and smudges. Put it all back together and it should work fine provided it survived the shock which is likely. All that said, this situation is highly unlikely. If you are fiddling with the drive in such a way this could happen, it's a niche circumstance at best. It's likely going to be tucked into some pocket or pouch in your laptop bag, getting pressed into other luggage when traveling. This level of protection is actually rather overkill for typical stowage situations.Now if you check my other reviews you'll learn I love poking holes in others. This is no exception as in only two reviews we have one case of user error to redeem: The drive only goes to sleep if your system allows it in your power profile. If you disable HDD spindown and set prevent system idling to sleep, this will not happen. Two options, both system configurations, and neither having anything to do with the quality of the product. Perhaps best to ask about these things or contact support before posting a review that cannot be edited or deleted without contacting Newegg support.",6,6

Speeds were reasonable.  Rubber bumper is well made and seems like it would serve it's purpose."," I am giving this drive one star due to LaCie's choice of drive vendor, Seagate, in this case.  Please read the ""other thoughts"" section for an explanation."," I purchased this drive in March of 2015 for my girlfriend, and it sat on her desk as served as storage for her videos and recorded music (she is a working musician).  The drive worked without issue for several months, until this month (August 2015), when the drive refused to spin up.  I opened the enclosure and found the Seagate drive model number (Drive is branded as Samsung, but has Seagte stickers on it), googled it and found that this model of drive has a very poor reputation among data recovery companies.Since we did not expect the drive to fail within a year, she did not have complete backups of her work stored on the drive, and now have to both return the drive and pay for data recovery services (which are not cheap).I have not contacted LaCie regarding this drive yet, however they are only obligated to replace the drive, not cover any data recovery).I used to use Seagate drives for all my personal needs as well as my client needs, however as of late their reliability seems to be doing downhill.

Drive failed when I needed it most causing lost productivity., I gave this drive three eggs because it failed after less than 100 hours of actual usage.

I use this drive for backing up my laptop and to store software that is needed to restore my laptop while not in the office. I purchased this drive thinking that a rugged rated device that is treated gently should be reliable for years and in the most critical moments. As it turns out while I was in Russia recently and needed to access one of my virtual machine files the drive would not connect or give any indication of activity even after trying multiple cables and other PC's to rule out my laptop and cable as the source of failure. Ultimately this drive is no more reliable than any of the dozen others that I have used over the years.  Would I buy it again?

Huge R&D department should give lots of peace of mind about buying their products. 2TB for this price is a good deal, the fact that it includes online ""cloud"" storage is just a free bonus really. Appreciated and a free way to test out ""cloud storage"". Drive speed is pretty average for today's external hard drives, interface is USB 3.0.Thin and light, easy to carry around."," Cloud storage should only be used for least important of your data. Posession is still 9/10th of the law, if it isn't physically on something you physically posess then you don't really own the data. With that said, ""cloud"" storage is very useful for making things accessible across multiple computers. Of course thumb drives are cheap and fast today, so if it's sensitive data in any way, that's a better route. Be paranoid, if your address is in there, your bank account info, anything that would answer a security question, etc... it should be guarded and protected. The easiest and simplest way to do that is to keep it on something you physically own. It's not a type C USB connection."," My experience with Seagate, vs Western Digital, external hard drives tells me WD is the way to go for an external drive. I was an IT professional for over a decade before moving to Engineering. In that time I had exactly 0 external WD hard drives fail on me. I lost count of the number of seagates that had issues; though I will say I was always able to recover the data. Which is more than I can say for some other brands, Hitachi *caugh* Hitachi. With that said, the more recent Seagate drives improved on this exponentially. I haven't sold this drive and don't intend to, I will keep it for as long as it lasts, hopefully that's at least 5 years. All in all, if you need an external drive compare the price of WD to Seagate and the warranty. If one has a longer warranty get that one. If they have the same warranty get the cheaper one. It's basically a dice roll by the year 2012 between those two companies, as to which edges out the other. Seriously though, don't put ANYTHING sensitive in the ""cloud"".

Hopefully the metal side acts as a heat sink and is not just decorative purposes  because the Achilles heal of external drives is heat. The drive is fairly slow but adequate for an external drive. I used Gnome-disks on Fedora 24 on a Skylake system to measure the speed. Using 100 MByte samples the performance numbers are as follows,Average Read: 89.7 MNytes/SecAverage Write: 93.9 MBytes/SecLatency 19.93 millisecondsI'm hoping that the reason for the low performance is to keep heat down, reliability in this application is much more important than performance."," I have no way of knowing how reliable this drive will be however my experience with external drives is that they are very unreliable. I've had several Seagate external drives in various form factors, 3.5"", 2.5"" but never in this size. Every external drive that I've ever owned, and every external drive that my friends and colleagues have owned, has died in a year or two. I would not use any external drive to backup anything important, they are best used for temporary storage or to move large amounts of data.

It's smaller than most modern day smart phones and will fit into a shirt pocket with relative ease. I only got to test this over USB 2.0 but was able to backup my windows 10 partition (404GB) in about 3.5 hours. This was using windows itself to make the backup so results with other software may be quicker or slower. Given the size of the backup, I was fine with this speed. The drive barely got warm during this period of constant use which is a great thing. It has an indicator light to let you know that it's on. This led light is neat in that it ""breathes"" when data is being transferred to or from it. I like this much better as an indicator of activity than other drives that simply blink rapidly on and off as an indicator. It has a setup file already on the drive. This basically takes you to seagate to register the device, but it also registers you as a user for seagate. At the end of this process, installing seagate dashboard is offered. This is seagates own backup utility. It's very simple and, although it allows back up your PC, it's just personal files and folders. Some are automatically built in and you can customize it, but don't expect the software to do a full PC backup. Just use windows itself (in the case of win 10) or another software to point to the drive and do a full ""image"" system backup. This also comes with ms one drive 200gb online storage backup for free. This is not available outright and forever. I believe it is for a year, after which, you'll have to fork up the dough on a regular basis. I don't know about you, but the entire reason I'd get something like this is to avoid having my files being held hostage because I didn't/couldn't pay for the online service to continue. As such, I did not take them up on this offer but it may be a selling point for some of you. The dashboard software also allows mobile backups of your pictures and media from your phone straight to the drive and also uploads and backups of social media sites pictures and videos. Again, not for me but worth mentioning for you. I have had no issues and have left it plugged in since I got it. It works just as you would expect it. It will travel very well but be warned the cord is maybe 12 inches long so you won't be able to keep this plugged into something, without it being very close by. It is nearly silent, very light, and just plain works and the price is fantastic for this much storage. I'd recommend it."," This drive was not a speed demon even by usb 2 standards (which was how I had it connected). The usb cable may be too short for some people that want it hooked up all the time. Seagate is having all sorts of issues with other drives right now; with hds, semi-long-term reliability ( a year or so) is a concern. Warrantys are nice, but no one wants to use it. I'd rather buy something knowing the warranty is a formality rather than a guarnteed-use feature. With seagate, we just don't know anymore. Time will tell. I would not say the drive is flimsy at all, but it doesn't feel substantial enough to shove in a suitcase for travel (which, presumably, would be one of the great things about it) considering how badly luggage is beat. Protecting it during travel or keeping it on your person would be a must for protection. Fortunately, it's small and light enough to do just that."," Keep a keen eye on long term reliability. Companies can and do change over time. To maintain profit margins, sometimes the only people who suffer, are the end users. For the time being, I can recommend this to most people who want to backup important data, but maybe have an alternative option for the most sensitive of your files just to be safe.",1,1

Its barely a foot long too :\ and the software that comes on it you can install on your pc for automatic backup, security protection ect... but i didn't care about that so i just formatted. To keep in mind the actual size for storage is 465 Gigs. And it DOES NOT MATTER if you delete the files that come pre-installed on it, it will still amount to 465 gigs after erasing them.

9SIA0AJ1AN8513,22-236-204,1/1/2013 2:38:07 PM,Somdy V.,Tested And Passed,5," This unit is very compact and can easily be carried around in your pocket if need be to transport it from place to place. Sturdiness and strength is also a major attributes to this unit. It was accidentally dropped off my desk to the floor about 3 feet and no damage was done to the external and internal of this unit.The speed of this unit is on average using a USB 2.0 port.Read and write time on average was about:1.0min/per GB for documents1.5min/per GB for videos and picsfor a 40GB file transfer I tested several times.The speed of this unit using a USB 3.0 port was cut down in almost half the time.30sec/per GB for documents50sec/per GB for videos and picsfor a 40GB transfer.Depending on your system, speeds may vary. Not entirely 100% sure if the speed of your HDD or SSD factors into it, but I did notice a difference when transferring files from a 5400rpm/7200rpm/10000rpm HDD. The computer with the SSD when transferring files to this portable HDD was significantly faster than the HDD."," The only con I have is that the cord is short, just a little over a foot. Wish it was a tad longer cause the USB ports are on top of my case and the NZXT Phantom case isn't made for anything to be placed on top of it."," This unit is very sturdy and reliable. There are other external HDD out there, but only one with the Western Digital name on it. In the end chose what's best for you in cost. Most external HDD are used and placed in a storage area for a rainy day. If you do a lot of file transferring from one computer to the next, you won't  be disappointed by the performance.",1,1
9SIA0AJ1AN8513,22-236-204,11/14/2012 6:45:43 PM,Jack W.,Pretty good choice for portable drive,4," This is an enclosed 2.5"" 5400 rpm, 8MB cache drive that uses USB as its data and power source. This expandable is very portable as the hard drive enclosure provides just enough room for the internal components. This portable drive isn't much bigger than an MP3 player. Pricing for this portable drive is competitive to others of its kind. This is the third portable drive that I have owned. What makes this one a step above other portable drives is that it only requires one USB port where some require one for power and one for data. For write data connected to a USB 3.0 port, I transferred 1GB worth of data in 25 seconds and for write data connected to a USB 2.0 port, I transferred 1GB worth of data in 46 seconds. It's by no means slow but not as fast as other portable drives. Small chunks of data, takes almost no time to transfer of course that depends on the system the data is coming from. A slow system will not gain these numbers as my system is using i-series technology. For read speeds, you can generally look at the write speed number and double it for read. Because the portable drive gets its power from the device (PC in most cases)  it is plugged into, when the device or system is turned off the portable drive does as well. However, I did plug the portable drive into my NAS box, which is always on to see what kind of temperatures the portable enclosure would get and after 3 days it really never reached over 32 degree Celsius. That isn't bad but I don't believe the enclosure was made for extended uses as it has no air ventilation. This isn't untypical for portable drives as my other one has no way of venting heat as well and know I've had that powered on in some case for up to a week at a time without any issues. The drive does come with a software package that can be used to password protect the drive, run diagnostics, and backup."," This isn't really a con but some would place this in this area. The portable hard drive isn't a true 500GB drive. It drive storage space is actually about 466GBs. The first con I see is the length of the USB cord. It only measures out at about 15"", which to me isn't long enough. Where my USB 3.0 ports are, it require me to place the portable drive on top of my system, which is where the heat is ventilated from my system. One may also have the same issues if this is a portable for let's say a school environment. As most school computers are located under a desk, the cord my prevent the user from finding a location to place the drive. My previous portable drive as a USB cord that is twice as long and I found in some cases that cable length not being sufficient. As mentioned, heat really isn't an issue but could be with prolonged usage as if the portable drive never being powered down. In cases like this, we could be talking about this portable drive being used as cloud storage device that is never turned off. I'm only stating this because prolonged constant use could cause the portable drive to overheat or the drive to fail. Not all hard drives are designed for constant 24/7 usage. The software on the drive installs on your PC system. After installing the software, I found that my system takes longer to boot into Windows. I also see price being a con. This isn't a bad portable drive but I believe for the price of this drive one could get more drive space. 500GB internal drives are going for $40-45 and this is going for twice that price. So the enclosure costs $35+ ? Not enough space for the price."," This portable drive would provide a good way to store data from one's PC or to transfer data from one system to another. As for the cord length, it is possible to purchase a longer cord if needed or maybe an extension to it. I've purchased quite a few USB extension cables for devices that won't reach. In closing, there quite a few positives towards this drives usefulness; it has a decent write and read time for data, easily transported as the enclosure has a small footprint, doesn't overheat during typical usage, and the pricing is competitive. After several weeks of use, I could only come up with three negative for this drive; the length of the cable, software could be better, and price is too much for a 500GB drive.",4,4

Windows recognized it as a portable hard drive (on the box it says Mac will require reformatting due to the drive being pre-formatted to NTFS). When it is in use, it's also very quiet. -Construction: Feels sturdy. There's only one input, which is the proprietary USB 3.0/2.0 port and a LED that lights up when it's in use. There's four rubber feet that preven the drive from rattling on what surface it's on while in use. -Portability: Because its the roughly the size of a passport (hence the name), it can be carried around with ease (save for the USB cord, which I'll touch on later). It can easily be put in a laptop bag, suitcase, purse, or even your pants pocket. -Tranfer speeds: Western Digital (WD) states it can reach up to speeds of 5GB/s via USB 3.0, 480MB/s on USB 2.0. Transferring files and media is quick. I was able to transfer 168 photos, 800KB-1.5MB in size, at 3264 x 1952 resolution each in less than 30 seconds on a USB 3.0 port. This may change depending on different system specs."," -Proprietary USB cord: It's the only cord you can use unfortunately. No mini-USB. So if you accidentally misplace the cord, you'll have to purchase one directly from Western Digital, or another retailer that supplies it."," When you first explore the files pre-installed on the Passport, along with a more detailed User Guide, you'll find various files and applications you can install onto your computer. You may or may not want to install these, and just use the hard drive to save your important files but they are pretty useful. They're strictly WD applications that apply to the hard drive; WD SmartWare, Security, and Drive Utilities. SmartWare is a simple option you can use that allows the drive to automatically categorize your important files, photos, videos, etc. and back them up for you. There's an option to override it and choose which ones you want to back up. WD Security allows you to set a password or hardware encryption to prevent unauthorized usage. And Drive Utilities allows you to check if there's any errors with the drive that may cause data loss or complete failure. There's also a QuickView feature that's installed. In the Task Bar tray, you can mouse over the WD QuickView icon and it gives you information about your Passport; Drive Name [Volume], Capacity used in percentage, whether or not you've set a passlock on, and temperature status.",1,2

The drive is very small and sleek and nice looking. It can fit inside almost any pocket or purse with ease. When you first plug it in it will install the driver for you so you do not have to. You get 931GB of useable space with it (the other space is for the driver as well as some pre-included apps you can install). Running CrystalDiskMark, the sequence read and write speeds were almost identical getting to around 120 MB/s each (this test was using a USB 3.0 port on my desktop, see Overall section for system info). Transferring one of my 1.5GB movies from my computer to the drive took only about 12 seconds, which I must admit is impressive. You get some bloatware with it, but most of it is useful. First you have the WD SmartWare, which helps you easily backup your data from your computer with a quick overview and selection process of which way you want your files backed up. It also allows you to connect to your dropbox account for easy access to backup what you have in the cloud as well. Then you have WD Security to help protect your new drive just incase anyone steals it and wants to hack into it...it provides you with an option of setting a password to access the drive. To help keep itself up and running there is also the WD Utilities application to run diagnostics, completely delete everything off of the drive, and register the device. Granted, you don’t need any of these applications to just use the device as it is, but they are “neat” add-ons to have offered."," verall, no major cons with this device. Just some suggestions for WD in the future. The first suggestion I would have is to have an option to bundle all of the software together (you currently have it separated into multiple applications, it would be nice to have an option for one application to run it all). The second piece of advice I could offer is to give the exact link to the user’s manual online (in the pamphlet you get it has a link that takes you to reading documents for all of their devices, not just this one and it becomes a pain to search for the device there). Also, I would include a bit of a longer USB cable as this one is a bit short in  if you have to connect it to the back of your computer and the table you want to place it on is a bit farther away. Other than those, I have no issue with how this device functions."," I would say this is a great device to get for storing you mass amounts of multimedia or wanting a drive as a backup for your computer. The read/write speeds on this device over USB 3.0 are pretty amazing (see speed test in pros), making data transfer easy and quick between your computer and the drive. I’ll be using this device as both a backup and a storage drive for now. This is a great buy for those running out of space on their computer or want a secure way to store their files as well (using the password and file encryption).Hardware specs of the computer I tested on:Intel core i7 4770K HaswellAsus Maximus VI Impact Motherboard16 GB of RAM DDR3Nvidia GeForce GTX 770 (EVGA) Graphics cardSamsung SSD 840 EVO 1TB Main System DriveWindows 8.1",None,None

Windows and Mac support.," Proprietary software that gobbles up a portion of the space available. Formatted to NTFS so may not be plug & play with all systems. I personally rate this at 4 eggs rather than 5 because of its proprietary nature, it is not truely plug & play.As stated by another reviewer, the pricing seems a bit out of whack if for only $20 or $30 more you can get the larger capacity model."," The case is very nice and being made of aluminum I would suspect it would help keep the drive running at a cooler temperature better than a plastic case would, although during all my torture the drive temps never showed any signs for concern.Although I dislike having to install proprietary software on my PC, the WD Smartware is a very easy to understand software and installed and even updated to the current version without a hitch on my Windows 7 Ultimate box, alas as is usually the case there is no direct Linux support. The ability to include your dropbox account is a nice touch although there are other services out there that offer much better plans (10 to 20GB) for free as well. Hardware encryption could be a plus to some, especially if you are the type that drag this thing around with you wherever you go. For the normal Joe that leaves it sitting at home as a Backup destination leaves little use for it IMO.The Pro software provides licensing for three computers once you register the product on the WD website.Not exactly sure of why one would want (or is that need) to back up the files on the cloud? If the cloud servers mess things up you still have the files on your computer, if your computer messes up you still have the files in the cloud, and/or on your other devices that are synced with it. ???I was able to transfer a 1.1GB file to the device in just over 30 seconds. Transferring files from a second USB3.0 device saw rates of 70 to 72 MB/s for a sustained period of time and the drives never seemed to get any warmer than about 105DegFOn a side note for those that use and maintain OpenSource computers, this drive does work equally well on Linux systems especially once you ditch all the proprietary software from its internals, which will also see the recovery of disk space so you actually get 1.0 TB (1,000,170,586,112 bytes).Overall I am quite happy with the performance aspect of the drive, and would recommend it to those looking for a simple option for backing up their PC that runs Mac or Windows. I would equally recommend it to those running Linux as long as they want to deal with a total delete and reformat of the drive prior to use.",None,None
N82E16822236784,22-236-784,10/13/2014 10:44:54 PM,Anonymous,Does it's job nicely,5," All around good portable hard drive. Not a whole lot to say here, most features at this point are pretty much standard. USB 3.0 is nice, does provide a measurable increase in performance (see benchmarks in Other Thoughts). I like the metal casing, but as others have noted, the drive is not encased in solid metal. There is a brushed metal shell that covers an inner plastic casing. LED not super obtrusive, decently long USB cable which is detachable. Noise and heat-wise, no issues there, drive is barely audible and only gets a little warm.Software included works well enough, although this will be subjective from user to user. I personally already had my own suite of backup/cloud backup software so I don't see myself migrating to WD's proprietary SmartWare Pro software, but if you don't have anything else, it is nice (and free with the drive). Hardware encryption is a nice feature that you don't see very often."," Not much in the way of cons. Navy color is more in the way of purple. Not bad, just don't expect it to be more blue-ish navy like jeans are.", Hard drives excel at sequential read/writes so those are the benchmarks presented using CrystalDiskMark. They are not far off from what other reviewers have found. On USB 2.0 I got about 28MB/s and on USB 3.0 I got in the neighborhood of 105MB/s. So a noticeable difference on USB 3. Definitely worth it if you have easily accessible ports and are transferring large file sizes.All in all a good drive. Does it's job admirably.,None,None

Not much reason not to!,4," - 3yr warranty!- Machined aluminum case  (but a plastic bottom)- 14"" length of cable (not including the length of the connectors).- Barely got warm in testing- Silent- Unobtrusive Activity LED unless you're looking right at it- Comes ready to use in NTFS format.  Drive is formatted to 1 trillion bytes (1 TB), but keep in mind that this translates to an effective 931GB of reported usable space- Included software works pretty well for being free:	- Includes the basic WD SmartWare suite, but has (3) activations available for the full Pro version.  (Not sure why you'd need three, unless you setup the software on three different systems)	- Ability to password protect the HDD.  On systems you designate, you can have it automatically unlock.  This keeps the password lock from being overly intrusive every time you go to use the drive.  As well, if you have your system on any type of automated power-on to run backups, you wouldn't be able to perform the backup if you weren't there to input the password.	- Backup software can do scheduled backups or always-on continuous backups as data changes.  After you go through the super-easy online activation to the Pro version of SmatWare, you'll also have integrated backup/restore from your Dropbox account	- Basic utilities for checking drive health	- The included help file pretty much will walk you through any of the functions you can do with the software.  Using CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3, I tested the drive 5 different systems, all with USB2 & 3 capabilities.  The average 1MB Sequential Read/Writes on USB3 was a pleasant 113MB/110MB per second.  On USB2, it takes a significant but expected hit.   It only averages 32MB/30MB on the 1MB Sequential Read/Write test, which is about half of USB2's theoretical 60MB/s max speed.  I'll cover the 512K Random tests in the ""Other Thoughts"" below."," There's really not much to complain about with this drive!  If I had to nitpick...- 14"" cable (not including the length of the connectors)- USB2 speeds could be a bit faster given what it's capable of using USB3.- Currently $90 at the time of this writing.  For $110, you can double your capacity with the ""Titanium"" model, although I can't say it's the 'exact' same drive inside, just larger.  The 2TB version of this particular drive is $140, so still only $50 to double your capacity."," Other than picking at the price point on this drive, I really have no significant complaints.You may have noticed that I mentioned the 14"" data cable as both a PRO and a CON.  I think for portability, people don't want to be wrapping up a 3ft cable.  For me, 14"" is long enough to be able to plug in the drive and then place it out of the way, but also not so short that if you plugged into the back of a tower, you're not left with it dangling.I really like the fact that it has a 3yr warranty and performs decently on a variety of USB3 controllers.The other thing to mention is it's 512K random read/write speeds.  I specifically didn't list it as a PRO or a CON for a couple of reasons.  1) If you're using this for a backup drive, larger sequential read/writes are going to be the primary operation and this drive is fine for that.  2) It's been a while since I've reviewed HDD performance factors.  I've been doing all SSD reviews and rarely use HDDs anymore, so I can't say that this drives Random 512K Read/Writes are far out of line.  I did find it interesting that it's 512K Random Write is ~17MB/s FASTER than its Read.  On USB3, the 512K Random Read is ~42MB/s and the Write is ~59MB/s.This drive ALMOST gets a 5-egg rating.  I believe the performance is up to par and the free software seems like something someone may actually use.  And the mostly metal enclosure is nicely machined.  However, 5-eggs are reserved for items that I unequivocally recommend as a ""Best Buy"".  That being said, I'm taking off one egg because the case is not 100% metal as you might expect, but primarily because you can double your capacity for about another $20-$50, so the 2TB model is a better overall value in a GB/$ comparison.",None,None

Seagate's Slim Portable drives have always had a nice design, but they have improved that with this newest line of products, including the 1TB model I'm reviewing now. The Gold dimpled design catches the light and just looks great. While the slim, eye-catching design is nice, it's the performance most of us care about. The STEH1000101 doesn't let down in that area either. I was easily hitting 150 MB/s speeds on via USB 3.0 on sequential reads AND writes. This is one of the first external drives that I've noticed performs just as well on sequential writes as it does on reads. That is impressive! Has a special ""Paragon Driver"" that you can use to set up the drive to work on both Windows and Mac OS without reformatting. This will no doubt be useful for people that have both PC's and Mac's on hand. There are mobile apps available for Android and iOS to make transferring files to and from the external drive or the cloud very easy and strait-forward. The apps simplify the process, even for all the non-tech savvy folks. I tested the Android app personally and it worked great. No complaints there. The drive includes a free two year subscription for 200GB of cloud storage through OneDrive. 200GB is enough to backup most of your pics and even a good bit of your videos as well, so that's a great bonus freebie. Additional cloud connectivity is available for Google Drive and Dropbox, as well as social media backup for your Facebook and Flickr accounts.", The random read and write performance could be better. But that's not a deal-breaker and is to be expected from a drive of this type.," I don't have much of anything negative to say about this drive. It's a complete win, especially for the current price. I highly recommend it and would suggest even having a couple on hand for backups and transferring data to and from other devices.

It is very slim and non-obtrusive.  Very modern, elegant in design and I've gotten great comments on this drive.  The speed is great and I have been averaging 110 MB/s using USB 3.0.  No issues with a month of use using it to transfer video, music, photo and large amount of other personal data.  Very happy and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a small portable drive with a huge amount of space.  1 T is an still an enormous amount of space especially for a portable solution.An added bonus is the 200 GB of cloud storage for 2 years.  I'm not even sure why they had to add this but how cool is that?  50 GB would have been awesome, but 200 GB is outstanding and simply amazes me.  I no longer search through pictures to try to save the best ones to save on space and just keep everything and this cloud storage has just made that easier because my other cloud storage only gives me 50 GB of storage.", It's still a mechanical drive and I would hate to drop this onto a hard surface.  Accidents do happen when you least expect them and I plan on having an additional backup of the important data on this drive onto another drive but this is common sense with any drive so always keep that in mind.Speed transfer is another concern.  It would take over 2 hrs to fill this drive and probably more closer to  3+ if you were writing at full speed.  An SSD would be a much better choice if speed and huge amounts of data are of most importance.," This is a great solution to anyone needing a portable drive with a large amount of space, ultimate portability and very elegant design.  I know I will be getting a lot of use out of this drive and the cloud storage that Seagate has included for free is pretty awesome and almost unheard of with any other drive you will find.",1,1

Quite small and portable and easy to use security software to keep all that data safe. Drive runs cool and very fast when connected using USB 3.0 hitting 120 MB/second without the need for a power cord. This drive comes bundled with free programs to help you backup, protect, and manage the drive easily for both Windows and Mac systems. This drive is extremely quiet and I've never heard a sound from it. There is a very bright white LED that is always lit when the drive has power which also blinks when the drive is accessed making it easy to tell that it is plugged in and working even when you are not using it.

9SIA22F5CD4708,22-236-891,7/28/2015 5:03:35 PM,John B.,Well-Rounded External HDD,4," * I’ll admit I had slight bias coming into this review as Western Digital is my favorite storage manufacturer. When buying one of their products, you can usually be assured of their quality. The same applies to this drive.  *- Though I usually prefer Black, the WD My Passport Ultra “Blue” edition is appealing. The top has a glossy finish and looks more purple than blue, especially in the light. The sides are a black matte. On the bottom are rubber grommets that hold the drive in place. There’s a single LED indicator light on the side near the port. It’s understated but can be noticed without any annoyance. While running, the drive is practically inaudible, only heard when you press your ear against it.- Included on the drive (usable 1.82TB) are a couple folders, a user manual and a few programs for mac and Windows. Installing the .EXE WD Apps Setup will install WD Backup, WD Security, WD Drive Utilities and WD Quick View; these free programs lead to all the extended features that the Ultra touts. Of course, if you want to simply use the drive as a storage drive with no frills, you can do that, but I recommend buying a different Hard Drive then, for the Ultra shines because of its extra features. Once installed, there are a few software updates to follow. I’ll outline the three programs’ cool options in the following paragraphs.- The WD Drive Utility program has a few tests you can run to ensure the Ultra’s health status. From here you can check if SMART is enabled and running properly. You can also scan for bad sectors on the Ultra, much like the Error-Checking in My Computer. Another handy feature is a Sleep Timer to set a certain time after which passes the Ultra would sleep–as opposed to running 24/7, diminishing its life. A Secure Drive Erase is also included in the Utilities to reformat and start fresh easily. - To use a tiresome (and inane) cliché, the meat and potatoes of the Ultra is the WD Backup Program and WD Security it is bundled with. The Backup App includes a Dropbox backup as well, which is somewhat redundant since Dropbox can do the same thing within its own program. Most importantly, here you can select the source disk(s) you want to backup continually and schedule Daily (specific days of the month), Hourly or Monthly backups. The backup will run in the background unobtrusively and automatically per your settings (see Cons). To illustrate the program’s flexibility, I currently have it backing up my RAID Game SSD drives and my main Boot SSD every other day at 6:00PM. The WD Security app allows you to assign a password that must be entered to access the drive.- The Read and Write speeds are decent enough and very close to each other. It isn’t a significant difference, but the Ultra is slightly faster than other USB 3.0 External HDDs I’ve tested. By slightly faster I mean anywhere from one MB to 10MB/s. I’ve included some benchmarks in Other Thoughts for reference."," - This is a common shortcoming concerning portable external hard drives and even WD–quite literally–fell short. The included USB 3.0 cable is short, 18” long. It’s not terribly short, and since External Hard Drives are meant to be portable, it’s hard to find a good balance when it comes to cable length. The cable will be fine for use with laptops and portable situations, but placement of the drive will be more limited in a desktop scenario.  - The WD Backup App will run in the background and you can maximize it if you want, but doing this doesn’t provide much information. The only information on the status of your running backup that’s available is to right-click on the toolbar icon. It would be nice if the WD Backup provided some more information when maximized; rather than just an icon.- To be honest, there are plenty of programs out there, including free ones, that will accomplish the same tasks as the WD programs bundled with this drive. What WD did here with the included apps is more a matter of convenience than an intuitive stroke of genius."," * Overall, the WD My Passport Ultra is a well-performing, bells and whistles external hard drive. If you’re looking for some included apps to make your life a little easier for security or backup reasons, the Ultra is a good choice. *- Below are some subjective benchmarks I observed and documented using real-usage scenarios, as well as ATTO Disk and CrystalDiskMark. * Real Usage *USB 3.0-- Moving a 8.24GB Video file from PC's HDD (WD Caviar Black) onto drive. Time: 2 minutes 1 seconds. Peak: 70MB/sec. Average: 69.15MB/sec. USB 3.0-- Moving 2.09GB to HDD from 3.0 drive.Time: 17 seconds. Peak 150MB/sec.* ATTO Disk Benchmark *With a QD of 8, at 32KB to 8MB, the Read/Write speed was consistent and negligible. 32KB – 8MB Write: 111.7MB/sec.32KB – 8MB Read: 111.9MB/sec.* CrystalDiskMark * At 6 runs, 4000MB.Sequential Read: 112.9MB/sec.  --  Write: 112.3MB/sec.512k Read: 41.4MB/sec.  --  Write: 51.54MB/sec.4K Read: 0.515MB/sec.  --  Write: 1.168MB/sec.",14,14

After unboxing it I dropped it from above head height onto my lino covered wooden kitchen floor and it survived intact without any damage or marks left on the case and it worked when I connected to my laptop.It draws its power via the included USB-USB (i.e. not USB-Micro USB) cable, therefore there's no need for an extra power lead. My Windows 7 laptop recognised it immediately and automatically installed a couple of drivers. It comes formatted to FAT32 but before using it I reformatted it to NTFS (a quick 10 second Windows process).Copying 285GB of data to it took around 90 minutes with a very impressive average transfer rate of 61MB/s. I use a USB 3.0 ExpressCard adapter so you should get even faster speeds with built-in USB 3.0. It's backwards compatible with USB 2.0.It looks modern and stylish (the high quality photos here don't really do it justice), with a black case made of very hard, reinforced plastic and six orange silicone shock absorbers. The shock absorbers - and I really do like this - double as the USB cable holder when it's in transit. It's silent in operation.In summary, this is a high quality 1TB portable hard drive and its's now replaced my Seagate portable drive. With impressive transfer speeds and the peace of mind the shockproof protection offers, it's well worth the money and I definitely recommend it. It has a 3 year warranty.", None,,1,1
N82E16822301016,22-301-016,10/1/2014 9:03:39 PM,Sangjin A.,External HDD that you can toss in your bag,5," One of the most distinct character of this hard drive is the bumpers (orange in my case) that are in tact along the edges and corners and act as shock absorber. The bumpers also have cutouts to hold the USB cable around the edges of the device and stays nice and tight without any dangling motions.By connecting the hard drive to the computer, it starts spinning in a barely noticeable noise and is ready to go. With a USB 3.0 port, I got an average speed of 106MB read and 77MB write, and it transfered files very fast considering that it's still a spinning hard drive and not a solid state drive. Moving a 1GB large video took about 7 seconds and it would still read/write fine while the hard drive is being hit against a table top. While I haven't tried throwing the hard drive across the room, I did drop it from 6 feet up high and ta da, still good to go. The indicator light is also embedded beneath the black casing with a blue light. It's hidden and visible, but not extremely bright where it gets distracting, great.It's a perfect external hard drive for your to go needs. Since there's no turning back on a damaged hard drive, this hard drive is definitely a relief from being afraid of losing data like the precious pictures you took last trip.

Both are working fine with the exception of one cable (more on that later). The enclosure has excellent construction, and it is very easy to break down if I have to replace the drive in the future. The inner rubber lining (orange bit on the black version) is more like a cage that continues underneath the plastic cover, and there are foam spacers between the cover and the hard drive as part of the suspension.With USB 3.0, speeds seem to peek around 100MB/s and average in the low to mid 90s. This is on m4v video transfers from a WD 2TB 7200rpm backup drive.  Very satisfactory for my intentions as a college backup drive."," One of the cables that came with the drives refuses to pass USB 3.0. Luckily I had a few USB 3.0 superspeed enabled computers and two drives for comparison, so I tested both thoroughly, swapping cables, drives, computers, different files, etc. Whatever the cause, it occurs only with the cable in question, and operates at USB 2.0 speeds or less. Transfer rates seemed to hover in the low 20s. I'd suggest tacking on a spare USB 3.0 cable to your order when you buy this drive. If the stock cable fails you have an instant replacement. If you somehow misplace the original, you have a spare."," I suspect this case will be with me a long after the drive passes MTBF (if I'm lucky). I would still have to physically verify that any old 2.5"" SATA can work with the interface board by Silicon Power though.",7,7

True, it has a black-plastic backing to it, but the top and sides are reflective metal/aluminum as you see in the pictures.

Both Mac and Windows versions are included so you don't have to have internet access and download them wherever you are. The included software did not seem to cause any impact on startup or normal use of my computer, which pleases me."," There are no major cons for this drive from my experiences, as everything went smoothly as expected. A minor inconvenience for me was that the included cable is not long enough to have a floor-standing PC connected to the portable drive sitting on my desk. Its range was restricted to sitting on top of my computer."," The Metal Edition is very sleek looking. It is metal-encased on the top and sides (cap-style), with the bottom being black plastic.

The metal reinforcement makes it seem like it would be durable, but it will still break due to the moving platters if dropped so be aware. The lights on the HDD are very dim in my opinion so they are non intrusive but still tell you when the disk is active so that is very nice. The HDD is a thick but small form factor so it will fit in a large pocket or easily into a backpack. The USB 3.0 Interface is fast but not as fast as it could be. There is 2TB of space that I have yet to fill. The included cord is small but due to the microusb standard you can find much longer cords that will work with this HDD. The HDD formats well to the GNU/Linux system and rsync so this makes it great as a backup system for linux servers.", The WD Applications/Programs are very bloated. They took my computer awhile to install. Some of the programs are in fact useful but some features are absolutely useless and intruding to the use of the program. The software likes to crash a lot.

Good on weight as well as feel of the outer hard case. It has a micro texture of the metal case that is very nice, it kind of has this cross grain feel, it definitely gives you a bit more control while holding on to the surface, nowhere near slippery . Soft rounded corners are very nice and it is very shiny so if you're like me and buy into the shiny factor then this drive has that appeal locked down. It has a pin hole blue light next to the cable connection that does show the HDD status and it's not that harsh piercing blue; it's a soft light blue which is a big bonus for me when transferring files late at night in low light to not have a blinding blue light coming off the drive. It is plug'n'play and you don't have to install the WD Smartware to make it work. That is what I had to do as you will read in my cons section - I had a lot of issues with the WD Smartware but once I blew that out and used this just as an external drive, it was great and fast, I just wished I would have gotten the software to work for me. I am using VirtualBox as my virtualization software so if anyone knows if this was part of my issue, please leave a review saying so, I do check back from time to time. I think that overall it's a good drive, I can't give it 5 eggs because of the software issues but if you're very comfortable with WD Smartware then this is the upgrade for you."," Where to start??? I really really dislike the WD SmartWare, it is way too bulky and took almost 5 minutes to install and while it was installing it updated my .net. I really hate when third party software updates my windows software to do menial things like external storage. I also disliked that the SmartWare was aggressive about what it thought I should update rather than what I wanted to update. You do have two options when installing the software. I ran both options and the more advanced option of the software was still more or less aggressive about scanning my installed hard drives and telling me what I should back up. The biggest disappointment was when the software kept crashing when I left it open and unattended for a more than three minutes. I had to uninstall the SmartWare to really use this drive as a backup source. I am using a windows 7 virtual machine that is running on virtualbox 4.2. I also came across some very interesting information about SmartWare and MAC not working properly, I will leave a link to the forum where I found this information on and will allow you to read the conversations that have taken place. The metal case only covers the top and the sides of the device and not the bottom. The bottom does not even have a non-slip coating or feet so please be careful that it does not fall off your desktop with its short 19 inch cable. The cable is even a bit shot for laptop use in my humble opinion.  I was not really able to test this drive the way I wanted to, there are many feature of the software that did not work for me seeing as how I had to blow the software out to make the drive work. I would bet that many of you out there reading this review would not have the issues that I have had and would be much happier than me, but that is just a guess. I am running three virtual machines on my one tower and not sure if that has something to do with the software glitches or not so please read as many reviews as you can before taking just my word on things"," I can't really give you a speed test here as I can't get the Smartware to work properly but it does move files quickly once I created my own file on the root of the hard drive.

Inside you'll find the bare drive angled on plastic packaging, a small ~6"" USB3 SS cable and a thin manual.  Pretty straightforward.  Plugging it in on my Windows 10 x64 Pro machine was as easy as could be, and I had no issues.  As is typical for Seagate, you'll find a folder with installation / data tools and a registration PDF link to the online form for the drive.  Otherwise, the drive shows approximately 1.81 TB once initialized.  HDTune numbers were about on target for what I had expected.  This drive, being so portable, isn't exactly a performance monster but values the benefit of 2TB of storage in such a small form factor.HDTune:Read: 138 MB/sec Max and 57.8 MB/sec Min.Write: 130 MB/sec Max and 53.8 MB/sec Min.  Both burst rates for the drive were at about 170 MB/sec in both reads and writes.Both the read and write benchmarking had a nice, gradual curve downward - nothing terribly abrupt or outlying as the disk was filled during the tests.  I am a professional wedding photographer so this drive was utilized simply for the main purpose of additional file duplication and backup in my workflow.  I choose not to test out the 200 GB of online cloud storage since I already have other backup solutions in place.  For the price and especially portability, the drive seems sufficient.  It stays only warm to the touch and has a singular white indicator light for power state.PROS:--USB 3--2TB--Super slim form factor that could fit in a shirt pocket, purse, or pants pocket (if you're careful) ;)  Would easily fit in a computer bag.--Sufficient performance for the tiny size.", I had no real Cons for this drive except that it was pretty much as expected upon arrival.  The slower drive speed and tiny size do not lend to blazing fast performance.  Portability definitely trumps speed and that's fine., I've only had this drive a few weeks and do not plan to run it continuously since it is a backup device for my needs so I can not comment yet about longevity or any issues just yet.

Which, I think at this point in time should be fairly expected by now for portable externals, especially when many of Seagate's internal slim drives have this option...• A more flexible USB cable would be nice since they're so short and easy to push around the light drive."," To get a slightly thinner drive you have to pay a slight premium, but performance is not affected so it's up to if that's worth it. A solid, relatively fast drive, regardless though.",None,None
N82E16822178862,22-178-862,9/30/2016 9:50:21 AM,Peter T.,Very impressive,5," The packaging was really nice and let you see the product color and size and texture.  It looked tough enough to protect it from basic impacts as well.  The 2 year warranty is clearly stated on the box as well.As soon as the drive was plugged in, it mounted as a 2TB volume with no stupid emulated devices or software to install first to ""unlock"" the device like other manufacturers do.  It was formatted properly with NTFS and was basically all set to use.The PDF containing the warranty information is right on the drive itself in the root directly, which is fantastic (unless it were to fail and you couldn't read it but you can make a copy of the PDF as soon as you receive the drive.)There is an autorun script on the drive to run the ""setup"" software but autoruns are blocked in most versions of Windows.  You can easily run the setup file yourself though.  Unfortunately it's not actually a software setup installer, it's just a link to the registration page.  It does pre-fill the serial number though, which is nice.  It also requests that I download the Seagate Dashboard software, which I don't think is designed very well and I prefer to use my own suite for backing up, etc.  The final page reveals that the 200GB of free cloud storage is actually with Microsoft's One Drive which is nice if you use that service.  It's a 2 year duration and it'd be nicer if it was forever but that's reasonable.On a modern USB 3.0 controller, this drive tested at 134.1 MB/s read speed and 133.4 MB/s write speed.  The scattered reads were an unimpressive 0.498 MB/s and 1.422 MB/s scattered write but those numbers are only important if you're running an operating system off the drive.  Those speeds overall indicate that it is the ideal drive for backup and storage of large files and that's what it is built to do.After some heavy activity, the drive only reached 29 degrees celsius, which means the enclosure is cooling it very effectively.  Overall I'd say this is the perfect 2 TB portable drive and is superior in every way to the large, bulky 3.5"" versions that require a power plug on a wall outlet."," The drive only spins at 5400RPM according to its SMART and device data in Crystal Disk.  That has a small impact on the speed but almost all 2.5"" drives are in fact 5400RPM.  It's safer from a failure rate and heat standpoint though.Right out of the box this drive had 11 total power cycles recorded, which is VERY strange.  It also had 7,899,487 recorded misreads with less than 1 hour of total runtime.  This is before I even wrote any data to the drive.  It is worth mentioning though that Seagate drives record every single event that could be considered a misread like ECC corrections which every drive has so they're not true misreads or a true indication that the drive is failing.  It's still odd that it generated so many ECC-related misreads in just basic testing at the factory.The biggest downside to this drive is the LED is only a power indicator. There is no flashing LED light to indicate disk activity.  It's not a big deal, but it would have been a nice feature to include."," I thought that the ""USB 3.0"" specification could be listed larger on the box and a lot less subtle than simply on the side in tiny print.  That's definitely the main feature of the drive since 2.0 models are only capable of around 33MB/s.The actual hard drive inside the enclosure is a ST2000LM007-1R8174, which is a very impressive and high performance drive.",None,None

Using all the programs I have to check drive health, none of them showed any errors on the drive despite this. When the drive was idle it did not disconnect at all, it only occurred when under load but even that was very inconsistent. Also tried different external drives and only this one had the disconnect issue. It appeared to get better the more I tested it, so hopefully it won’t happen again."," To sums things up, other than the weird disconnect issue that occurred, this is the best portable external drive I’ve tested yet.

It's fast enough for most applications.It's USB powered, which is relatively standard for portable style 3.0 drives but good to know, and definitely better than 2.0 models back when they required wall-warts or weird stuff.The aluminum is good for dispersing heat too. It won't run hot, at least not under any load I can put it under.All in all, great for a portable backup / data drive."," There is no case, not even a cheapo cloth bag.I have never been impressed with WD's ""smartware."" It's not very smart, to say the least.With or without bitlocker, I get roughly 110 MB/s (read and write) according to ATTO. This isn't the best USB 3.0 speed you can get with a drive, but it's still very good for most applications. If you need really heavy throughput, you might have to sacrifice some other features that this drive has.Part of the speed issue is probably the 5400RPM drive, which is better for reliability, compactness, heat, etc., but keeps the speed down from other drives that might get 140-150 MB/s.Not clear how to update firmware -- it's not included with the drive along with the other software."," The cable is short -- good for portable, bad for desktop. You know what you're buying, there are pictures, and if you need a long cable for some desktop setup, just buy one.I don't use their proprietary security, but it is very good from what other reviews state -- i just use bitlocker because that's what i use for multiple other drives that don't have it onboard.Note that the USB 2.0 theoretical max doesn't account for other hardware limitations -- you shouldn't get more than half the theoretical throughput of USB 2.0. Some reviewers don't know this. Just google it.Don't forget to UNCHECK the box ""item specific reviews"" to see all the reviews for different colored versions -- the hardware is what you care about, after all.",4,4

I may just leave it on the Linux box since I run an hourly cron job to back up all changed files.The included software is comprehensive and well laid-out.  The integration with Dropbox looks nice, although I did not try that out.  For a backup or extra drive solution that goes with your desktop or laptop computer, I really don't think you can go wrong with this drive.  2TB of space feels like it will never run out, too.Nice job, WD!",3,3
9SIA6AH2T50164,22-236-782,10/12/2014 7:59:08 AM,david s.,excellent external,5, this is an awesome external hard drive. it came in a decent packaging it could be a little difficult to open but well protected. the drive itself is gorgeous its the 10 anniversary edition of the my passport external hard drive. its in a beautiful aluminum casing its usb 3.0 and usb 2.0 backwards compatible . the speeds are some of the best I've seen for a 2..5 form factor. I did an atto benchmark I got 112 read and 110 write through the usb 3.0 .I use external hard drives   to transfer my files when I'm recording and also for recording directly to so I need fast speeds and a high capacity and at 2 terabytes it has plenty of capacity for what I need .  it comes with the usb 3.0 cord included . its a great buy for the price and size its one of the best I've owned I would recommend this drive to anyone, the only cons I can really say is the cord is about 2 feet long I wish the cord was a little longer its not practical for desktops the length seems better for laptops and mobile devices....but it works...and also he other thing and its just a personal preference the bottom is black plastic it would have been nice if the whole drive was the awesome silver and aluminum casing...but that really all I can think of,,3,3
9SIA6AH2T50164,22-236-782,10/4/2014 8:05:15 PM,Jason W.,This drive is phenomenal,5," Everything about this drive is phenomenal.  Design and Build: This drive has a very nice finish. Cosmetically it looks great and feels solid.  The exterior of the drive is a thin single metal piece with a plastic bottom.  It feels well built and is very sleek looking. The activity LED is very small and not excessively bright. It is just a pretty drive, as odd as that sounds. Performance:I ran a few iterations of CrystalDiskMark and on average; this drive runs around 110 MB/s sequential reads and writes.  Of course this is for a single large file read/write, so performance will vary greatly depending on what you are transferring.  For a USB 3.0 2.5"" hard drive this is, for all intents and purposes, the same speed as an internal drive. Also, don't forget this is an encrypted drive and for almost no performance impact that's terrific.Software:The WD My Password Ultra drives come with a small suite of utilities that let you check the SMART status (health) of your drive, run a simple or complex drive test, set the sleep timer of your drive, erase the drive, and also set an encryption password.  These tools are extremely easy to use.  The drive also comes with a free copy of WD SmartWare Pro. This comes with 3 activations so it can be installed on 3 machines you intend to backup.  This software is very easy to use and setup.  You can back up by category or by specific files and folders.  You then set a schedule on how frequently you want to backup or an option to continuously backup as files change.  It also has support to back up to your DropBox storage, if you have that service. I cannot stress how nice and simple this software is. To my knowledge, most external drives do not include backup software, so it is a real plus that this is included.Encryption:If there is one feature that should sell you on this drive, it is an SED (Self Encrypting Drive). There are a very limited number of drives out there that have this.  This means the drive has built in hardware that encrypts ALL data on the drive as it is written. There is no need for other software to perform this operation.  However, you MUST set the drive password for this feature to be essentially functional.  All data written to the drive is encrypted, however, if the password is not set anyone can plug it in and access your information.  Once you setup the password, someone could plug it in to USB or break open the case and take out the drive and try as they might, won't be able to access your information because it has already been encrypted.", There is not one con about this drive.,,4,4

It connects via USB 3.0 and works well with my backup software, Casper.  The transfer speed according to Casper is 10 GB per minute.Comes with software for encryption.Comes with software for convenient backup on the drive or to the cloud (you need a Dropbox account for that.)The USB 3.0 cable is 18 inches long, which I think is just right, but if you want a longer one, order it from Newegg along with the drive, the connector for the drive is a Micro Male B connector."," About 50% thicker than a typical compact portable drive. (I can't actually think of a situation where that would be an issue.)  I guess they must have put an extra platter inside, but I can't find that info anywhere on the net.  WD doesn't seem to offer as much technical info on their drives as they used to.Doesn't offer Firewire or Thunderbolt connectivity.You aren't supposed to use it above 95 Degrees F, according to the WD web site.  You will have to think up reasons to show it off to your geek friends."," This would be a great portable drive for a photographer or sales person who uses a portable drive when making presentations to clients.

I wanted to give 1 or maybe 2 eggs, but felt bad since two out of three of my drives do work well."," Several problems.1. The USB cable is stiff and quite short. The bottom of the drive case is smooth plastic. When using the backup, the drive easily slips off the table or chair arm, or whatever, because the cable is so short any movement of your computer drags the drive around. A rubberized coating on the bottom of the drive would be helpful.2. The Seagate ""dashboard"" backup program supplied on the drive itself and set to auto load is really bad.  I recommend you NOT use it. Instead, use the backup feature in windows (my OS is Win7). If you DO install and use the Seagate dashboard, be very careful NOT to interrupt the first backup operation. You might kill the drive if you do.3. Bought three drives, one worked for about 3 minutes then died (or was killed by some USB or Windows operation).  Actually, the drive is probably still good, but it wont work for me; its a brick. I have tried to uninstall, re-install, search for new drivers, roll back the driver, EVERYTHING.  Nothing helped. The power light won't come on, the drive does not show up as a USB device.  BUT IT DID WORK ONE TIME.  Then stopped. Now Windows 7 reports: ""Code 43. Windows has stopped this device because...""4. Even the registration program that pops up automatically is a joke.  The serial number self-populates in the registration form, but after I filled in the rest of my info and pressed the ""register"" button, i got an error message telling me that there was a letter in the serial number sequence that was not allowed.  BUT THE SERIAL NUMBER was correct, and the program filled it in automatically!!  When I get lousy programs supplied with a tech product, I tend to judge the entire product and the company poorly.  The Seagate software sucks."," I researched, I considered WD, Seagate, and a few other products. Finally settled on Seagate, which was a mistake. One dead drive out of three.

The only concern I had was what would happen to the info I had stored on the drive. Since they were only copies I did not need data recovery service and seagate is prided on either destroying said files or the platter from the drive itself if the data cannot be completely destroyed. I also requested a copy of the paperwork once the data/drive platter is destroyed just in case for my own peace of mind. Seagate said they would accomodate. I gave it a rating of 3 eggs because of my experience with Seagate Customer Service. The drive itself would be at most 2 eggs,0,17

This is the second one of these (different color) purchased.  The first one beat the snot out of a thumb drive.  Nice amount or portable storage for a nice price too.  No I didn't buy the first one here.  It was an emergency purchase mid build from a local brick and mortar store.," 1) The loss of a star goes against New Egg's shipping.  The drive was at the bottom of the box in direct contact with the shipping box.  All the cushioning was stuffed on top of it to hold against the outside of the box. This is the second time I've received a hard drive from New Egg Edison like this.2) For whatever reason this drive vibrates in operation.  My first one, an emergency purchase for a retailer, runs so smooth if not for the indicator light I would not know it was running.3) There is no doubt the indicator light is on.  I try to face it away from me because it is that bright."," It is a sorry state of affairs when a product loses a star because New Egg's standards seem to be slipping.  Once, hey stuff happens; this is the third time.  If this wee beasty fails because of being improperly packaged for shipping I'll post again.My first one is a tank providing a lot of portable storage for a nice price for the last two years; especially if you can catch it on sale.  It is an external portable hard drive.  They are not built for speed.  They are built to plug in and save a lot of data.  That is what the first one does and hopefully this one will do also.It is a WD.  Even with WD's reported slippage on QC they are still all that IMHO.New Egg,This packaging issue needs to be addressed.  I am specing out my next build.  If it arrives battered and abused, again, you may lose a customer.  The last build the mother board was so battered it was RMAed.  The last hard drive was packaged like this one badly.  Might be your Edison NJ facility needs a little QC work in the shipping department.This is the first time I ever posted a negative rating for New Egg.Bottom lineThis is my second one of these drives.  If it has issues I lay the fault at New Egg's Edison facility door step because the first one is a tank and this one may have survived shipping.Cheers,Null",4,4

You can set your backups to the drive, or your personal Dropbox account.  Built in backup plans of hourly, daily and monthly are available.  Selections for your libraries (Documents/Music/Pictures/Videos) or selection of any folders on your computer or laptop are also available.

External hard drives, such as this Game Drive for Xbox is the quickest, the easiest and the least expensive way to add large amount of storage to your Xbox. - Once I connected the external drive to my Xbox, the Xbox formatted the drive and asked me if I want to install new games and other content by default to the external drive. I said yes and that was it for the setup.  Now I have almost 2 TB of additional Xbox storage. Xbox- One can simultaneously use two external drives such as this 2TB Game Drive for Xbox. - It is rumored that OTA DVR functionality will come to Xbox One soon. If and when that happens, an external hard drive will come handy for recording hours of TV programming on XBOX. - I am quite happy with this drive so far. It works well for me.",1,1

Instructions claim that once the drive is plugged in, the Xbox (One) will recognize it as an external drive for games and apps and prompt to format. Unfortunately the Xbox One recognizes it as a media drive with no prompts to format or to copy game or app data.Not worth buying specifically for Xbox One unless you have to have green.",1,13

Very fast, and very well built drive. (results via my PC)- USB 3- Aesthetically pleasing- Works with more than just the Xbox. I was able to use it with a PS3 and my old, trusty Wii as well as my PC. I had no issues whatsoever."," Really, none."," This drive is fantastic. I use it on my Wii, primarily, for my homebrew stuff and it's been flawless. It's fast, small, and the green exterior looks cool. If you're looking for a solid external drive for your gaming system, this one should be on your short list. Great price, great product.",3,3

Stays cool as well."," Cord is pretty short, for it's intended purpose (Xbox) it shouldn't be a problem, but it barely plugs into a top slot USB on PC and reaches the desk.Green. Yes I also listed this as a pro, but this can also be a deal breaker for some. For those with a black or white case Xbox and prefer a more understated look so as to not draw attention, this would be an eyesore.Enclosure is a tad cheap, enclosure has a bit of flex to it."," It doesn't really stand out from other external drives aside from name/branding. It does however simplify the process, some drives will come unformated/partitioned, this is ready to go out of the box and doesn't require a power brick, so it is easy to just pick this up at a store and know it works.",2,2

USB 3.0 gets an average write speed of about 65mb/s which again is decent but nothing amazing."," USB connector on the drive seems a little flimsy, the included cord could have been longer.Because of the green case and xbox name on the case the price seems to be increased 20% which doesn't make much sense.The middle of the drive case doesnt have much strength and flexes pretty easily.One year warranty, should be at least 2-3 years."," There are a few kinks to work out particularly in build quality, price  and warranty which should not be so short, despite these problems it still is a pretty good drive your Xbox One.",2,2

You can only hear the drive spinning and the drive head moving to read/write if you put your ear up to it; otherwise, you won’t hear it during normal operation.", none, My transfer speeds on the USB 3.0 bus on my PC were to be expected for a USB 3.0 drive.

You simply plug it in, and go. maximum read speed is 128.2MB/second.  average read speed is 97.7MB/sThe original Xbox One (500GB) hard drive is a SAMSUNG Spinpoint M8 ST500LM012. which reads at 105MB/s.  with average about 90MB/s.  So this external will be slightly faster."," plastic drive enclosure could be a bit more durable, the corners feel pretty tough, but the center middle and bottom feel really thin.It does not feel like it would survive a 5 foot drop onto a hard surface without breaking apart. ""you shouldent drop it anyways""The usb 3.0 connector has some wiggle to it so it's probably a good idea to be delicate with it."," This drive is actually just a standard 2TB external.  It works with PS4, PC, and anything else that works with standard external hard drives.make sure it gets some airflow. it does get a bit warm from extended use. the cheapest 2TB external USB3.0 drives start at around $80. and offer identical performance. you are paying a bit extra for the Xbox logo on the drive. The internal drive is a Samsung HN-M201RAD Momentus SpinPoint. which is actually a pretty reliable drive according to 60+ reviews here on newegg. The usb cord is 18 inches from end to end.",1,1
9SIA2F84GM8907,22-178-778,8/28/2015 9:47:29 AM,Aaron B.,"Designed for Xbox, good drive!",4," Works great.  Tested on Xbox360, formats, saves etc just fine.  It looks like the price similar to other 2TB portable drives, but with the added Xbox styling and logo, as well as a ""promise"" of sorts from Seagate that it is designed especially for Xbox. Of course it can also be used as a ""normal"" external HDD for your laptop or PC, but you'll want to reformat the drive if you've been using it with your Xbox.Other pro's include USB3.0 speed -- transfers to and from the PC averaged 117MB/s (big file), which is about as good as you are gonna get from a 5400 rpm sataIII drive, which is what is inside this thing.  If you're an Xbox fan-boy-girl you might just like to have this drive because of its cool Xbox styling, and just use it as a normal drive.  That'll work just fine."," It seems there is a slight price premium for the Xbox styling and the promise that it has been designed for Xbox.   Its a little unclear what this means (other than putting it in a green case with an Xbox logo).   Perhaps there was some additional ""magic"" or testing that was done to ensure the drive would work consistently or well with Xbox devices.  We may never know, but if you remember the days of trying to hack Xbox's to change or increase storage, and the frustration that accompanied, you might appreciate the super authorized nature of Seagate's offering."," As with all these drives, 2TB means 2,000,000,000,000 bytes of storage.  According to my computer, this drive gives 2,000,396,742,656 bytes of available storage (NTFS formatted), so a bit extra space for good measure.  Thanks Seagate!(Sorry, couldn't resist. HDD makers get infinite grief about this, so I thought Seagate deserved a little hat tip for giving us a 2TB drive with MORE than 2 trillion bytes of capacity. 1.81TB naysayers can google ""Why windows reports tebibytes as terabytes?"" )While the branding may add a bit to the price, I suspect that sale prices will be very similar to the best 2TB prices out there, so no complaint here. By the way, if you do let it format on your Xbox, change your mind, and then want to use it with your PC, note that Xbox makes a bunch of partitions you'll want to delete before reformat.",2,2
9SIA2F84GM8907,22-178-778,8/27/2015 4:16:58 PM,Daniel C.,Zippy little drive,5," This is a pretty fast and resilient external drive. It's marketed as an external drive for Xbox 360 and Xbox One, but it works out of the box on PC as well once formatted to your OS of choice. I found it to have excellent read and write speeds for a 5400 RPM drive over USB 3.0, and it would be more than enough to install games to, play media and movies from, and store files for a computer. So far no issues with plug and play compatibility on Windows, OS X, or Linux (It appears to be a pretty standard USB controller.For the sake of science I decided to crack open the enclosure to find out what drive was used internally and found it to be a Samsung Spinpoint HN-M201RAD/AV1. The drive has excellent native speeds over SATA III and has fantastic reviews from users who have used it in laptops and as an expansion drive for consoles."," The only issue I have with this drive is that the whole bundle (The Seagate 2TB drive as packaged here) has a 1 year warranty, whereas the base drive that's inside (Samsung Spinpoint HN-M201RAD/AV1) has a 2 year warranty. I'm not sure why the warranty period is reduced on the whole enclosure, but it was worth noting."," Just about any external USB drive will work for Xbox 360 and Xbox One, but having one designated specifically for those two consoles at the same price as buying another external drive is great. I would definitely recommend this if you needed to expand your storage or just use this drive as an external portable drive for a laptop or desktop.",None,None

Maybe faster than needed for XBox use, but extra speed is always nice."," One year warranty is below par. Should be three years for a quality drive. Minus one egg for this.A minor point - lightweight and not a specially rugged case for true portable use. But, to be fair, it's intended to be plugged into an XBox and left there most of the time."," This is a nice, sleek pocket-size external HDD. To get an idea of its maximum performance i decided to compare it to a well known competitor, namely the WD My Passport Ultra 2TB portable HDD.Each drive was connected to a USB 3.0 port on my PC (ASRock Z97 Extreme4 motherboard / Core i5-4590 / 2x4GB G-Skill DDR3-2133 / Crucial M500 240GB SSD).SEAGATE GAME DRIVE 2TB COMPARISON TESTCopy 1 x 3.0GB  1080p HD video:Seagate Game Drive 2TBRead = 124MB/sec.Write = 52.5MB/sec.WD My Passport Ultra 2TBRead = 112MB/sec.Write = 110MB/sec.Copy 1 x 4.0GB  Pictures folder:Seagate Game Drive 2TBRead = average 102MB/sec.Write = average 22.4MB/sec.WD My Passport Ultra 2TBRead = average 86.5MB/sec.Write = average 48.3MB/sec.As you can see the Write speeds are not super fast, but once you copy large game files onto the drive you'll get good, solid Read speeds for game play, video playback or anything else you use it for.Seagate Game Drive has a 1-year warranty.WD My Passport Ultra has a 3-year warranty.Why doesn't Seagate have more confidence in the reliablity and durability of their latest product, i wonder?Otherwise, this is a nice external hard drive.",None,None

I would give this 5 Eggs if it came with a standard 3 year warranty. (1 year = Americas; 2 years = EU and Africa; 3 years = Asia and AU - as per top of packaging) *As far as the construction of the case is concerned. I would be comfortable sitting on this drive, tossing it in a backpack with heavy objects going to a friend’s house or any other hazards within normal use. BUT I would not ride my bicycle over it. You probably wouldn't want to do that anyways with any drive.  Specs and Tests:I did not run any tests on PC as that is not where I will be using this device and any performances seen will be meaningless.

Games did seem to run slightly snappier on the game drive but marginal at best. This should be expected running off a drive that's not hosting the OS with processes running in the background. Again this is marginal at best. Most people will not even notice and you should not expect any significant gameplay improvements on any attached external drive.Drive speeds really do not matter that much for external drives on Xbox. Its more about capacity. Check out some upgrade guides online for info.When using the drive for Games it needs to be formatted for Xbox. This is just how Xbox handles any and all external drives. Which is fine as I only intend to use this drive for game storage. If using for Media it does not need to be formatted and can plug into your computer.Overall I am very satisfied with this drive (except for the warranty). The Game Drive suited my price point, storage needs and I dig the Xbox aesthetics. It fits very nicely with my setup. Stoked on the extra 2TB storage.",2,2

It keeps the hard drive from being placed in a position in which it could easily be knocked over."," My suggestion when you first receive the hard drive:1) Right click, go to properties, then tools, then do an error check  to make sure its operating normally.2) Copy the files, folders, and documents from the hard drive to your computer and save in a folder in case you ever need to access the included software or warranty documents.3) Re-format the hard drive (file system based on your operating system, default allocation unit size, uncheck quick format -- this is so it will do a thorough format, which will take some time)4) When all is done, right click, go to properties, then tools, then do an error check to make sure everything is ok.5) I always suggest unchecking ""Allow files on this drive to have contents indexed in addition to file properties"", then click apply. The next screen will ask you which folders/subfolders -- highlight all subfolders and click ok. This will keep your system from indexing the files. Indexing speeds up search times. But for external hard drives, this ""speeding up"" (which is initiated every time you plug up the drive) is equivalent to the amount of extra time it takes to search for files that are not indexed. So, basically you dont need this feature and it will essentially reduce resource drag on your system.In fact, you should turn off indexing for your entire system in order to reduce resource drag.

It is flimsy, quirky, and above all very poorly made. It has an odd shape that involves multiple parts with different curves and angles and made out of an extremely and relatively malleable metal which as can be expected in a *portable* drive can then be easily bent out of shape by the slightest tension (in both the connector part inside the drive and on the cable itself).  The net result is that connecting your drive now requires wiggling the connector and the cable until the connection is made properly and then keeping it in that exact position while you try to complete your data transfer.  Try to get that done in an airplane...The net of it, is that if you are going to use this drive on your desktop where there is no risk of sudden movement that could apply the slightest pressure on the connector and affect its fit in the socket, then this may be an OK solution if you are really short on desk space (there are many better desktop storage options).

When I was first looking to purchase this item, my intention was to use the hardware security encryption. I needed to upgrade my 1TB small external HDD, which I encrypted with PGP. But I no longer wanted to use PGP,  you need the software PGP to open the drive, & this severely limited me to using my 1TB HDD on my PC’s / Mac’s only, or PC’s / Mac’s with PGP.  I used WD Passport drives in the past, they were good, but I could only use the WD encryption on Window PC’s. I have a couple of Mac’s, the encryption ran as a stand alone exe App, so my Mac’s had no idea what to do & was unable to open the encryption login needed to open the drive. This concerned me when looking at the Western Digital Passport Ultra, I asked, but no one knew, if the Western Digital Passport Ultra encryption worked on Win PC’s as well as Mac’s. Well I bought & received the drive, & I tested the encryption app, & the encryption App worked on all my Win PC’s & Mac’s. The drive is very easy to setup, I like the built in software, the HDD check, & especially the security encryption program, it was easy to set that up, & like I said earlier, it worked on my PC’s & Mac’s. I bought 3, & I am very happy with all of them. My average price for each was about $99.00, I used coupons & bought them on special.", n/a, n/a,3,3

Doesn't really get hot just a little warm after extensive use."," VCD (vitual CD- see other thoughts), other bloatware, the included vinyl bag gimmicky at best- very hard to fit the drive in to but very easy for the drive to slip out of it if not held the right way (it does not have a draw string to close it for portability), the cable is a little too short, customer service is outsourced and hard to understand."," I would give it 4 stars if it wasn't for the Crapware. The VCD is a deal breaker for me.

I also uninstalled all WD applications in my programs list. Big mistake, now every time I boot up or plug the drive in, I have to use the VCD to unlock it. otherwise it won't even show up. I've been searching all over the internet for a way to get rid of this crapware, but it seems to be impossible to do. I finally found  HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool that claims to be able to do it, but it needs to do a full format and it is taking a really long time- it moved may be 10% in the last 3 hours. In my opinion, this is no better than the root-kits that came on some Sony discs a few years ago. If a company includes bloatware in a way that also makes it almost impossible to remove, then that company is being disingenuous and do not deserve my business.

9SIA3TB1HF4865,22-236-202,10/25/2012 4:09:44 PM,Patrick S.,WD My Passport,3," Need to back up your important stuff? That's a good idea. Western Digital My Passport 1 Tb drive is a small portable drive that requires no power cord. The 1 Tb drive came with 935 Gb free when it arrived and was immediately recognized by windows. Included is a comprehensive suite of software for backing up your data, securing it with encryption, user manuals and even monitoring software to let you know the health of the drive. The back up options include a category option or individual folder options for backing up. It does monitor SMART data which is a plus considering its a USB drive. So you should be prompted if the drive starts to fail. Its USB 3.0 speed is FAST. I transferred from a SSD a 10 Gb video at 145MB/s  it took 94 seconds to complete. That is one of the fastest platter drives I've seen. Obviously its is 7200 rpm. The software installed in minutes and updated all the programs and the firmware which required a few reboots. The case appears to be quality plastic construction. After completing the back up I was able to access the data on the drive with another computer as needed. It was in a usable format, which is a must with back up drives. So you can carry this around and access your data when needed anywhere. It also gives you the option to restore the data to another location, like another computer which is a nice touch. It also passed the continuous back up test, where I created additional files on my hard drive and immediately they were backed up."," My first impression of the software was that it was complicated, and my impressions were correct. The software took a good 10 minutes to get updated and the firmware update was a little buggy. It would not work due to ""drive in use"" error, even though the drive was not in use. After a few reboots it eventually worked. The software, although a well thought out package, was just not user friendly. So there is a learning curve. Some areas were detailed and specific and other were sloppy with design. For example no option was included to not load the software at start up. This is a common mistake with manufactures and a pet peeve of mine. Software should install quickly, remove just as fast, and have the option to not load at start up. This software breaks two of these rules. After completing the back up using the standard settings it appears some things are missing in the back up copy. But this was most likely caused by my not understanding the back up process as it was complicated. The second attempt was successful. On top of that there was no way to schedule a back up. It appeared to only have one setting and it was continuous back up, so it monitored the data for changes and backed up when needed.    "," It's a fast, reasonably priced 1 Tb USB 3.0 drive for back ups or just more space. However I'm not sure I trust the software, but you can drag and drop folders to this drive which is a fool proof way of backing up. You can also use Windows back up utility to create a full system or partial folder back up. The drive itself is a five star for speed and design. Its a nice fast easy drive to use. The software is a one star.  It's way to technical for the average user and has some limitations that other companies don't have in their software.",None,None

It plugs into a USB 3.0 slot, and just sits there and does its job.  Once you set up the software, and tell it what you want backed up, it goes to work.  The first backup takes some time (mine was more than 1 TB so it took overnight to get it done).  After that first backup, it just searches for changes and quickly attends to those.   It runs silently, and very cool.  The only way I know it's on is by the icon in the system tray, and by the little flashing light on the hard drive unit.  I look at the backup now and then and I see that it's always accurate.  I like that it copies files exactly like they are on my main drive - rather than in some unreadable compressed format.  It's just like the headline says, it's a darn good little backup device."," There are various WD software versions that are available for this drive.  The software that comes with it only allows you to do a backup, and not much selectivity.  I instead used an older software version on the WD website and the software works fine with this unit.

The housing is light plastic with tiny rubber feet but it seems solid enough.I kept the drive in the plastic clamshell casing and the box it came in and padded it between clothing when I traveled overseas and back and sure enough the drive came through just fine, though some of my luggage did not.USB 3 for the win.

Automatic encryption is a welcome feature, because ""smaller"" also means ""more easily lost."" Manually unlocking the drive is a little tedious, but you can set it to unlock automatically when connected to your computer.Runs really cool! This is noteworthy because all my other external drives get fairly hot, which doesn't generally bode well for longevity in electronics. Heat is also a sign of wasted energy, so one might expect this drive to drain your laptop battery a little more slowly (I didn't have equipment to test the theory).Three-year warranty – yes! It's disheartening that so many drives these days come with only a year warranty. Drive failures can be troublesome, if not traumatic, so it's encouraging that the manufacturer expects this drive to last at least a few years.Data transfers are reasonably fast.

Personally, I like the ""wrap-around"" detachable USB cord."," 1) It is listed as USB2 backwards compatible, but beware:USB1/USB2 ports are often limited to 500mA (or less if it is shared) per bus. A lot of times this is not enough to reliably spin up a mechanical hard-drive which is why most external hard-drives come with a ""Y-split"" USB cable so they can draw power from two ports. The USB3 drive reviewed here does not come with this Y-cable since USB3 spec's 1A per port. Also the drive-side connector is non-standard (or at least not common that I know) so your old Y-splits won't work. I had to try a few different ports on my laptop before I could get it to spin up reliably.2) The drive is only rated for 5 to 50 degree C operational temperatures. It would have been nice if this range was extended to match the ""rugged"" use expected of these drives.3) the cover for the data-port that provides the water seal gives the ""feeling"" of not being very well seated..

It's easy enough to install it manually.[Automatically] backs up only one drive at a time; you must manually repeat the process for each one.  Not a big deal if you have just one data drive.This software will NOT restore a dead drive onto a new one.  There is no provision or ability to create rescue media or perform image backups with the included software.Once installed, the software would not allow my systems (one Intel, one AMD) to sleep, even if the drive were disconnected.  The GPU would idle, but mouse, keyboard, and fans remained powered up, and the system remained responsive.  This may or may not be an issue."," I tested this on two systems, one Intel and one AMD.  There were no differences.The included software is mostly good.  If you make frequent changes to files, but might want to recover one or more previous versions, buy this drive; you're done.  It's small, light, and fast.  It is NOT a complete backup solution though, as it has no provision to recover a dead system, just its data.  It does that very well though, and won't make you wait.  I think its anomalies merit loss of an egg, because it isn't perfect, and you cannot rely on it to be your sole means of backup.  Coupled with an image backup program though, it should allow you to restore an entire system.",None,None

9SIA0AJ1BU4147,22-236-199,10/29/2012 9:16:47 AM,Tristan R.,Great Product,5," Good fast USB 3.0 drive. Seems on par with other USB 3.0 external drives I have. Transferring a 750mb ISO file took about 10 seconds. CrystalDiskMark scores were a sequential read of 110.7 MB/s Read & 109.5 MB/s write. Took roughly 2 mins to backup a 25GB virtual image with included backup software. Again very similar to other USB 3.0 externals I have. Form Factor is actually smaller than I expected. Casing is solid sturdy plastic housing with nice read finish. I love how the LED activity light is dimmed so it doesn’t cause an annoying flickering common to so many usb devices. Backup software is very straightforward. Gives you the ability to choose individual files or an entire disk to backup. There are settings to choose when you’d like the backup to occur, or you can set it to occur when the computer has been idle for a period of time. Encryption system allows the drive to be unlocked automatically when the Windows User Account matches the one during initial encryption setup."," Included cord is very short, not very ideal for a desktop setup, more suited for a laptop/tablet. Backup Utility software doesn’t show specifically what’s backed up on the drive until you start the retrieval process. A summary of file types is shown & total amount of storage used on drive."," Transfer times were done on AMD platform. I personally don’t care for any of the included software. Backup utility is nice but I would prefer other freeware encryption programs over what’s included with this drive. Comes with Mac apps, user manual, & driver files incase you have to manually install drivers on another computer.

I didn't think I would keep this software installed, but I was impressed with its functionality and ability to keep from 5 to 25 prior versions of backed up files and easily restore them.* Convenient - Doesn't require any extra power source, and worked fine on my computers with the single-plug cable (as opposed to a ""Y"" cable needed by some external drives).  In fact, there is no additional DC socket either (two older USB 3.0 portable drives I own have optional DC power sockets).* Simple security - Password locking the drive is easy with the included software, and you can also grant your Windows user account automatic access for your own convenience.* Fast (in some circumstances) - In comparison with another external USB 3.0 drive I have, backing up the same data (a ~20GB database) showed a difference in as much as 25MB/s (with My Passport leading at around 100MB/s by the end of the transfer).  However, there was little difference when transferring smaller files (i.e. music)."," * I agree that the 18-inch cable is awfully short for use with a desktop.* I would like to see another feature added to the WD Security application: I have a flash drive from another manufacturer which came with software that let me lock a ""secure partition"" rather than the whole device.  "," :  * I don't see this as a significant drawback, but the drive would not work with my Belkin router's USB storage server (the router probably doesn't provide enough power through USB for this drive; I only connected it to see if it would work).  Since there is no optional DC socket in the drive, there would be no way to use the My Passport for this purpose.  (However, I usually use a powered WD My Book drive for this purpose with satisfaction, and I think this flaw is more of a fault with the router so I won't list it as a con.)* Western Digital is a long-time industry leader in storage, and when I did encounter a rare drive failure this year (different product, under warranty), their support gave 110% service by immediately replacing the drive with overnight shipping, as well as providing a return shipping label for the defective drive.This is my favorite external drive now, for speed and ease of use with backups, as well as for its portability.

With that being said, when I plugged the Passport into the USB 3.0 port it immediately wanted to install the SES driver, but it didn't. I was able to access the Passport anyway without it. But, after I manually installed the SES driver and rebooted, Windows 7 wanted to format the Passport. I did not think the Passport needed to be reformatted. So instead I visited the USB 3 maker's website, downloaded the latest driver and installed it. After another reboot, the Passport was accessed with no problem. However, the response was more like it was plugged into a USB 2 port. A 40GB copy process took 12 minutes. The copy started at 100MB/sec. then dropped to 60MB/sec. after just a couple minutes. I don't blame the Passport for this performance. I believe it is old technology trying tocommunicate with new technology. Also, a mechanical hard drive cannot perform write operations at the speed of an USB 3 ort. So I cannot believe I will ever get the 5GB/sec promissed by USB 3. But, I am planning on upgrading my computer hardware and OS to Wndows 10. Will see how it performs after that. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.

It worked for maybe a week and then then quit working.The power light comes on and the drive spins but the USB interface appears to be dead.It does not register on the USB bus or kernel nor appear as a device on any of the computers or smart TV it previously was working with.I bought the 1.5TB version of this about a year ago.  It also quit working but after at least 6 months and in a different way so that I thought the drive itself had gone bad.  I assumed I was just unlucky with that one and purchased this one on sale several months later.  After the USB interface on this one completely died I decided to dig the hard disk out of the old one.  I attached it to a computer SATA interface and power and found that it was working fine and there are no SMART errors.  So my conclusion is that the USB interface failed on that one as well but in a way where it still showed up as a drive to the computer but would hang or time out during read attempts.", I would not recommend this product to others unless it was improved.I chose a refund rather than replacement.I think Seagate needs to make the USB interface more robust so it can be reliable outside their QA lab.,1,1

Now it is back to normal operations.Also, if the drive is not in use, the solid LED that indicates it being online will go off.

Plug and play in Win XP/Vista/7 without problems.HDD: Seagate ST1000LM024 HN-M101MBB (Samsung SpinPoint M8).3 years warranty.," I have been using this drive for 6 months and the experience has been:The silicon material starts to come off because of the bad, dot glue.It is hard to properly close the mini USB port by the silicon cover and I don’t recommend water proof experiments.The main body of the enclosure is made of cheap plastic. So, the drive is protected only around the perimeter.The wrong combination of a mini USB port and a short USB cable creates an increased wrench, resulting in a weak, unstable connection. Even a very small movement of the drive or your PC causes connection loss between the USB port and the USB cable. This is a huge disadvantage because the HD710 is a mobile drive, not a stationary drive."," I can see the disadvantage of having the combination of a mini USB port and a short USB cable from the comparison of the HD710 with the SiliconPower Rugged Armor A80 portable drive (that has regular USB port and long USB cable). I have both of these drives.I took one additional egg off because of the deteriorating quality of NewEgg’s service.First, the product was poorly packaged. The HD710 drive lay at the bottom of the cardboard box with packaging paper on top of the drive.  The paper was not wrapped around the drive the way it should be. Could it be one of the reasons that many electronic devices delivered DAO (read internal HDD reviews)?This is why I stopped buying any HDD (except shock-resistant) from NewEgg.com.Second, NewEgg.com started to charge a shipping fee for the return of defective products contrary to the largest US retailers.

While there is a LED, it is not very visible. The rubber armor needed more design as it could have held the cable more cleanly, and the cover over the USB connection is a pain to close correctly. Problems with the USB connector cover could result in the drive not being protected.", As a hole the drive feels cheap with the USB connector and rubber armor not completely secured on the drive. The USB cable needed to be more supple; because when it is stored in the armor it doesn't want to conform to the drive giving it a cluttered look with the cable bending away from the drive. Maybe a way of capturing the cable ends would help. The USB connector is where I had the most problems. Stiffens of the cable and flex in the connector resulted in the OS seeing the drive disconnecting and reconnecting as I just moved the drive fractions of an inch.

Mine recorded a sequential read speed of 114.1 MB/s and write speed of 106.7 -- 4K random read speed was 0.467 MB/s and write speed was 1.510 MB/s (CrystalDiskMark). It copied 4 GBs of video files in 59.2 seconds.These are very good benchmarks for a 5400 RPM $59.99 (on sale) external drive (note: this is NOT the HGST Touro 7200 RPM drive that Newegg also advertises on their website for $79.95). For comparison, I also have a Western Digital ""My Passport"" that benchmarks about 28% slower -- and a Silicon Power A80 that benchmarks slightly slower than the HGST (Hitachi) and both were significantly more expensive.Some have commented that the included cable is short too, and inflexible. The cable is 18.5"" long which I do not find ""too short."" The cable is slightly thicker than others I have seen but not excessively so (and this will probably result in greater durability). I find it flexible enough.The cable also plugs securely into the drive and exhibits no excessive vertical or lateral movement at the connection point. The soft blue power/activity light is clearly visible but not so bright as to be irritating.With everything taken into account, I would say this is a very decent drive from the performance perspective. I am not deducting an egg for the cheap case because the performance is superior to others in its price range. I would recommend it to friends (in fact, I ordered two -- one for a friend).",2,2

9SIA3TB1HF4759,22-236-191,11/11/2012 3:56:45 PM,Matthew L.,"Good portable drive, lackluster bundled backup software.",4," I like the look of the case and the snug fit of the Micro B connector makes an accidental disconnect less likely. It survived a ~4ft tumble onto a tile floor (while the drive was off) caused by a moment of carelessness with very minor damage to the case (a minor dent on one of the edges). Hopefully that won't happen again, but it's good to know that the enclosure isn't so delicate it can't handle a little drop. Might want to consider getting the protective case that's sold separately if you've got butterfingers or will be using the drive in a rough environment.Password protection utilizing hardware encryption. Install WD Security on one computer, set a password, and then you don't have to install WD Security on computers the drive is subsequently used with. When connected it mounts a virtual CD containing the unlocking application, which after receiving the correct password from the user mounts the drive itself. This is probably suitable for most users and if you feel you need a more robust solution I'm sure you already have something else in mind.Cute little rubber nubs to absorb some vibration from the drive and stop it from sliding around. Hopefully they won't wear down too quickly."," Power/activity LED is a bit bright in a dim or dark room. Doesn't help that it also has an attention grabbing light blue hue, either. When it's plugged in I feel like I'm always aware of it in my peripheral vision.Included USB cable is a bit short at 18”. It's sufficient for laptop use, but restrictive when connecting to a desktop. I would have appreciated if it were a 24” cable and I don't feel that it would have impacted portability. I also checked to see if a 24” cable could fit in the packaging without them having to make it larger and it could. I recommend buying a longer USB 3.0 A Male to USB 3.0 Micro B (not the same as the older Micro-USB A/B connector you're probably familiar with) cable with the drive if you want more wiggle room.WD SmartWare is functional but flawed. There are two options for how your data is backed up: category mode and file mode. Category mode scans all of the data on the selected drive and lumps what it finds into categories. Unfortunately, it tends to miscategorize ambiguous (e.g. .mp4 audio file vs .mp4 video file) and obscure file types (e.g. not knowing to put .mpc audio files into the music category). This can lead to some files not getting backed up if you only select one category, but selecting multiple categories just to make sure it doesn't miss anything in the ones you do want means you'll end up backing up a lot of data that you don't want or don't need. Files it doesn't know what to do with are put into the “Other” category, which included useless data like my Spotify cache. Even after selecting all categories there was a discrepancy with the total number of files/folders, and while a lot of that may be unnecessary system data that it omitted (thumbs.db, desktop.ini, etc.) you might go looking for something only to find out it's not there. If you choose to continue using SmartWare I suggest switching to the “File Backup” mode which allows you to specify what folders and files to save.Regardless of which mode you use, SmartWare continuously monitors selected categories/files/folders for new data via a background process, so it does it even when the application isn't open. I prefer manual and scheduled backups over a continuous background process, so the lack of an option to only backup manually or on a schedule is a bit of a bummer. I'd also like an option to have SmartWare “echo” all changes made in the source directory to the backup directory to maintain a 1:1 mirror of the source directory. Without that option I had duplicates accumulating from moving, deleting, and renaming files even after setting the “File History” option to only keep 1 copy of files. I rarely feel the need to revert a file to a previous iteration and would appreciate being given the choice to throw caution to the wind and maintain an exact mirror of my source."," Here's a comparison of the transfer speeds I get on USB 2.0 vs 3.0 using CrystalDiskMark (5 runs, 500MB test size).USB 2.0, Sequential: ~37MB/s Read & WriteUSB 2.0, Random 512K: ~23MB/s Read,  ~35MB/s WriteUSB 3.0, Sequential: ~77MB/s Read & WriteUSB 3.0, Random 512K: ~31MB/s Read, ~41MB/s WriteOf course, speeds will drift higher or lower depending on where the head is on the platter and what kind of data you're reading/writing (i.e. lots of small files vs a single large file). It's just a 5400RPM HDD in there so it's not going to take full advantage of USB 3.0, but it does get a respectable boost over 2.0.If I considered the included backup software to be more important I would have rated this three stars because I feel it certainly leaves something to be desired, but there are freeware applications that offer functionality on par with and exceeding that of WD SmartWare (as well as various commercial options, of course). From a hardware standpoint, it's a hard drive from an established company housed in an attractive and compact case. It does what you expect it to do and as long as it doesn't implode without warning there's not much else to say. If the included backup software was better and the drive came with a longer cable I would have given it five stars instead of four.One last thing of note: don't put all of your eggs into one basket, folks. Copying data to a single external drive is better than nothing at all, but you should always try to maintain at least one off-site backup as well (another drive kept at a friend or relatives house, a cloud storage solution, etc.). If you lose access to the data on this drive for any reason you'll be glad you did.",3,3

I like the Elements hard drive, but it seems slow to me so I seldom use it for backing up file.  The Passport flies with the USB 3.0 interface and the software is a breeze to use.

N82E16822145919,22-145-919,1/23/2016 11:59:06 PM,Micheal H.,A great external at a great price!,5, Really fast sequential write and read speeds fluctuating between 145MBps - 154MBps for each in crystal disk mark.Easy plug and playSuper simple to remove internal drive for other uses Low power consumption, Random 4k read and write fluctuates between 0.5MBps and 0.9MBps, Like always shipping was quick and the drive was well packaged. This is a great affordable external with a 7200rpm hgst travelstar 7k1000 inside. For those interested it has a 32MB cache and is very quiet. I have put this drive through some stress testing since my intended use for this was to replace an internal drive on one of my old laptops or become an internal for my ps4. Perfomance wise it ranges from slightly better to crushes every other external I have in the same price point. It's random read and write speeds seem to fluctuate between 55MBps and 65MBps for both making that area only slightly quicker then what I get from my wd passport ultra drives and my other favorite the seagate backup plus slim. In the random 4k benchmark it is consitently slower then both of those but only by 10% at most. The 4kQD32 benchmarks seem to be a little better and in the worst of cases putting it on par with the wd and seagate consistently staying above 1MBps. The biggest gain in performance for this drive comes from sequential read and write speeds. New out of the box I was getting upwards of 160MBps for both and well into half full with 500gb of files stored on it I was still getting 145MBps+ for sequential read and write. With the drive nearly full with just shy of 800gb on it I was getting around 125MBps read and write.  Because of the sequential speeds this is best served as an external. It is quick until the very end. It also seems to give a slight increase in load times used in a ps4 and with the price about the same as the popular options like the seagate that people use for a ps4 internal this is definitely a better choice. Don't expect night and day differences since you are only shaving a few seconds here and there and a quicker boot for the ps4 if you use this for that purpose but it is essentially a free added bonus if you originally planned to use the seagate. In all honesty I was less impressed with how it performed in the laptop compared to the drive I had in it which was pulled from the same seagate external I have been talking about. With the HGST from this touro the boot time is noticeably quicker. Videos seem to start much faster and certain apps pop right up that used to take a second. Oddly though some apps that used to pop now take a second and it isn't always consistent with that. Cortana seems more laggy with the drive from the touro which I can only assume it is related to the random 4k speeds of this drive not being as good as the others. There have been a few other things like being able to see the textures load in with one of the games installed which I honestly don't remember happening before though in this case I could be mistaken. For an internal in a laptop I just don't see much of a benifit to justify removing a 5400rpm drive unless some light video editing or large file transfers are important to you. It's a good drive in every use but as an external it is a great affordable drive. It's also one of the best choices for an internal ps4 drive even compared to hybrid drives showing the same if not better in some cases load times. That is until ssd becomes more affordable at higher densities. The loading times of games are even more noticeable as an external for the xbox one which is probably due to the xbox's internal still being used for the os functions and not impacting the read speed like other functions do on the ps4 with it's single drive only option. If you are looking for a cheap internal for a laptop you will be better served with a hybrid drive since you will get much quicker boot times and most of the time the slower transfer speeds won't be noticed in normal use. If that isn't an option or there is a great deal on this drive you won't be disapointed.,4,4

I wasn't expecting a 30' cable or anything but I think it's only 1.5'! 6' would have been perfect, heck even 3' & I wouldn't have mentioned it. The drive does power down after being idle for maybe 10 or 15min but the spin up time is ok, maybe 5-10 seconds & it's back up and running. I haven't tried changing the sleep-mode timer, but I have my power settings configured so that nothing goes to sleep mode... This is where docs would have been nice. Again, I was so happy with the total price I can't bring my rating down for these minor nit-picks."," Overall, so far, I LOVE the drive, it is what it is. I also have to note here that I am waiting for my USB 3.0 ports in the mail. (Also ordered from Newegg.) But speed was not an important factor for me. It seems fast enough for me, 25MBs write & 35MBs read. If you change its Removal Policy to Performance, instead of ""Quick-Removal"" you get a nice, fast, ""Fake"" write speed. The drive plugs right in & works great. I don't have to burn my junk to DVD any more!Another thing that needs to be brought up is these manufacturers getting away with false advertising. This is a 465GB drive. Toshiba & MANY (if not all) other drive manufactures use the formula 1GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes, instead of 1GB = 1,073,741,824 bytes as they should. For 20 years I have been putting up with explaining this to others & just accepting the false advertising. Maybe some day they will stop using the wrong conversion rate & I won't have to deal with people complaining that ""Tehy stolezen meh gigermagigerz!"" Hah!",9,10

I'm sure the speed will be great when I get USB 3, but for now USB 2 speed is OK. Disk spins down quickly when not in use -- besides saving power, this can add to the useful life of the disk. However it's disconcerting at first when you think your disk has died."," When I did my initial ~200GB bulk data transfer to the disk (Win 7), the transfer hung part-way through, with the disk spun down. I don't know why this happened.

They actually use Scorpio Blue/Black in them, they are ultra low power, and can be powered by a single USB cable, not a dual/Y cable, like most others.Those of you who are buying this drive for any other purpose than use for a laptop are fools — there is no reason to pay the premium for a drive of this type so you can complain about the speed, the lack of cache on the drive or the shortness of the cable. It’s a LAPTOP DRIVE.It’s a high RPM, standard cache, 2.5” drive, low power, but still high performance, in a USB case with a great controller and it stays cool.Why, in the world would you buy a 2.5” drive that needs no power brick with such small capacity, for a desktop/tower computer is pure lunacy. This is a PORTABLE drive. It doesn’t NEED to come with a cable longer than 12”. If you want that, buy a MyBook USB 3 drive, get it in 1 to 3TB capacity for near the same money, & it will be faster & will accept a 6 foot USB cable, & self shut-down on"," There are none. These are among the finest portable drives there are.  I will be interested to see them come out with some additional hybrid technology, such as a 256MB DDR bridge or NAND bridge, so that they can take advantage of the USB 3 speed.  Watch for that from Seagate now that they bought Samsung’s drive division. They are already out in full size drives.  It’s a natural to make portable, low power drives like these really fly.  The only bad part about using DDR RAM with or without the NAND is that whatever is in the RAM is not protected until it gets to the SSD module and then written to the HD.  But the 256MB / 8GB SSD / 500 to 4TB hard drive is the perfect bridge between pure SSD and lots of speed from a standard drive.It’s especially appropriate for portable drives - and the Western Digital is the best of them."," Watch for WD Scorpio Blue/Black and Hitachi mechanisms to start showing up - hopefully with 16MB cache, and the above hybrid technology I mentioned. They will be worth the extra $50 when they hit — as long as you have eSATA or USB 3 to take advantage of the speed that hard drives could never reach just a few years ago.",8,9

There are 3 clips on the longer and 2 on the shorter sides. Once you pop those up you can just remove the drive which is held to the USB3 adapter board with some aluminum (heat-conductive?) tape.It was really easy to open the box - took me probably less than a minute.,4,4

After unboxing it I dropped it from above head height onto my lino covered wooden kitchen floor and it survived intact without any damage or marks left on the case and it worked when I connected to my laptop.It draws its power via the included USB-USB (i.e. not USB-Micro USB) cable, therefore there's no need for an extra power lead. My Windows 7 laptop recognised it immediately. It comes formatted to FAT32 but I’ve I reformatted it to NTFS (a quick 10 second Windows process). Before formatting, there’s an Activate Warranty file on the drive that clicks through to the Silicon Power website where you can also download a copy of a backup software suite.Copying 285GB of data to it took 90 minutes with a very impressive average transfer rate of 61MB/s. I use a USB 3.0 ExpressCard adapter so you should get even faster speeds with built-in USB 3.0. It's backwards compatible with USB 2.0.It looks good, with a black scratch resistant reinforced case with a silicone band that acts as a shock absorber and also incorporates a cover for the USB socket. There’s also a neat groove where you can attach the USB cable to the drive. Silent in operation, it stays cool and is also water resistant too.In summary, this is a high quality 1TB portable hard drive. With impressive transfer speeds and the peace of mind that the shock proof protection and water resistance offers, it's well worth the money and I definitely recommend it. It has a 3 year warranty. I received this for free from the manufacturer in return for this honest review.",2,2

It's thinner than my other 2TB portable USB drive by a substantial margin.  This ""Seagate"" enclosure contains a 2.5"" 9mm Samsung Spinpoint M9T ST2000LM003 drive which explains a lot.  Earlier large capacity 2.5"" drives were of the 12.5mm or 15mm variety.  This portable drive is sleek, light weight, and quiet.  Oh, and I might add it's pretty darn fast for a platter drive over USB 3.0.If you do your research, or trust mine, then you'll find that the Spinpoint M drives are favorably reviewed.  My own benchmarks match the reviews.  According to ATTO, I'm getting a little over 140 MB/s in sequential read and write speeds with this little guy.  In a real-world scenario transferring 14GB worth of files to the drive, I am seeing speeds of 120-130 MB/s.  It's not SSD fast, but it's great for a spinner.  I must reiterate this is over USB 3.0.  USB 2.0 and earlier will severely bottleneck this drive."," The only con I can think of is the enclosure is fully sealed with no way to swap out the drive if need be.  Most portable USB drives are like that these days, so no surprises there."," So what's left so say about this portable hard drive?  The LED is worth mentioning.  Seagate has made the activity light a stealthy thin sliver that can barely be seen among the diamond facade of the enclosure.  Best of all, unlike many in the industry the LED isn't annoyingly bright.It's truly wonderful to have a large amount of storage in such a small package.  The really nice thing about it though, is you don't have to wait forever and a half to transfer content to it.",4,4

I carry it around in its little carrying case, which I very much appreciate, and then pop out the USB cord when I want to watch one. In my experience, this cord is plenty long; mostly it's connecting to a USB hub on my desk or a slot on the side of a friend's laptop. In the worst case scenario, I have to go under a desk to plug it into the back of some ancient Dell or Gateway. For this inconvenience, I blame the owner of said relic and not the drive. With USB 2.0, it's fast enough to watch my videos off the drive itself, without making copies to the computer (unless I want to). 160GB was large when I bought this and still is, for many users. However, I'm excited by the prospect of larger drives in the same Aegis format. This drive is stylish, reliable, and convenient as hell. I recommend it for its intended use - occasional access (not to always leave on or run programs off of)."," None. Having trouble with your MIR (mail-in rebate) is not a device Con, but rather a harsh reality of the cold, capitalistic world we live in."," A number of reviewers complained about the size of the drive. First of all, this thing is very reasonably sized; if it got much smaller, I'd worry about losing it. Second, it has the dimensions listed: 0.7"" x 3.3"" x 4.7"".

I was debating whether to bring it along until I opened it up and held it - it weighs less than a pair of socks and isn't much larger than a deck of cards. It was a no brainer. During the trip it dutifully backed up from my laptop all the priceless photos of my 1-year old daughter being terrified of Mickey Mouse and other costumed characters, as well as several hi-def movies recorded on my camera of her 3rd trip through the It's a Small World ride. Once we came back home, I was able to transfer everything back to my high end desktop PC in what felt like no time at all.

Some new installations of Operating Systems may need drivers downloaded, so as long as you have internet, it will automatically do it for you. Transfer speeds are incredibly high compared to USB 2.0, compare 60MB/s to 625MB/s, that is 10x more! Some people may disagree, but I like how it looks, its square-ish with a slight slope on the front and matte colored with a tiny blue LED near the port. The cable length is decent, anybody needing a longer one for a 2.5"" Ext. HDD might need to look for a 3.5"" instead. Let me tell you a little something about Seagate HDDs, they are incredibly reliable. So since this product is Seagate, expect it to last, so the 1 year warranty shouldn't be a problem. I had a 20GB 3.5"" Internal HDD from 1996, and it still works, travel and all."," Compared to similar USB 3.0 External 2.5"" HDD, this is quite expensive. As of November 2012, it's on sale for $69.99 from the original $99.99. There is a similar Samsung Portable 2.5"" HDD with USB 3.0 going for $49.99 from the original $79.99. That is a $20.00 difference! To boot, they are both Seagate HDD inside. The casing looks like it's made from cheap plastic, I said ""looks"", I didn't say it is. The shape may pose a poking hazard to bags or gadgets when freely moving around since it does have pointy corners. I know Seagates are reliable and all, but come on, 1 year warranty?"," This Drive being USB 3.0 will require that your motherboard has the internal drivers for USB 3.0, if not, it will downgrade its performance to USB 2.0 speeds. So if you're buying it for the USB 3.0, please update your chipset drivers to accommodate it. My final thoughts on this product is that if you're looking for a USB 3.0 2.5"" HDD, get the Samsung because it will do the same thing and it's $20.00 cheaper, plus Samsung carries a 3 year warranty. The people that would buy this is for the financially gifted, that want a Seagate branded External 2.5"" HDD. I haven't opened the casing to see what type of Internal HDD it has, maybe it carries the high end Seagate HDD, who knows?",1,3

At less than 14c per GB small drives of this type are inexpensive and combine plug and play convenience (USB 2 or 3) with pretty high speed., *Short USB 3.0 cable  (both drives use the same type of cable)Initially I considered the short cable an asset (thinking of travel) but when working with a laptop actually in my lap each time I moved I would enviably pull the drive by its cable – I fear failure is only a couple of hundred such pulls away., I recently tested and reviewed a WD 750gb USB 3.0 Passport portable drive compared the two side by side with the following results.* Price per GB (inc shipping):  WD = 12.6c    S = 13.9c * Performance (Ave transfer rate MB/sec)  WD = 84.7   S = 86.2* Size:   S > WD* Weight: S > WD>>>Conclusions<<<<These drives are very close but I favor the WD over the Seagate.   While both have the drive mounted in ridged plastic boxes I found it easier to press the outer casing of the Seagate into the inner drive than with the WD.  Why is this important?  When packed in a tight bag I think the thicker WD with the rounded edges will survive better than the Seagate with the pointy corners.   Otherwise there isn’t much between them.>>>Troubleshooting Tip<<<If the drivers aren't automatically detected on your windows 7 system then look for updated USB 3.0 drivers.  I found this to be necessary on a refurbished laptop I picked up for a client.  I plugged the drive into the laptop’s USB 3.0 port and it failed to load device drivers - I found new USB 3.0 drivers on the laptop manufactures website which corrected the problem.,1,1

(Will fit in a jean or shirt pocket.)- Runs off USB power so no additional cables are needed.- Respectable speeds for a 5400rpm drive:I generally saw ~80-100MB/s over USB 3.0 for sequential reads.Random reads, using a copy/paste of a folder with ~10,000 files of various sizes, were around 20-40MB/s.  (I could list your generic benchmark results here, but there's already a ton of those in other reviews.  This is more of a 'real world' usage benchmark.)Write speeds, while slightly lower, were equally respectable.While 5400rpm might sound like a bad thing (compared to a 7200rpm drive), it means this drive is virtually silent and stays cool.  Less heat generally leads to a longer life span for hardware.- The drive will function perfectly fine over USB 2.0 however you’ll be limited to around 60MB/s.- No drivers needed.  Just plug it in and go."," - The plastic casing offers very little protection for the drive from any significant drop or crushing weight.- The 1 year warranty came as a surprise as there are a few very similar performing products with 2 or 3 year warranties at or below this price point.- More of an annoyance then a con, but the cord is very short.  At only a foot and a half it does limit where you can place the drive.  While an overly long cord can be equally annoying, at the very least one should be able to plug this into a PC on the floor and rest the drive on top of their desk.  If Seagate were to bump the warranty to 2 years and offer a three foot cable I honestly think they'd have one of the most solid 500GB external drives offered."," I read through all the reviews here hoping I could add something that hasn’t been said however my thoughts are on par with everyone else. While I wouldn’t recommend using this drive for heavy duty use (ie video editing or running applications off of it) it works great as easy transportable storage or a nice backup drive for your PC. Personally I have mine plugged into the router on my desk and setup for networked storage so it can be accessed from any laptop or pc in my house 24/7 to be used for saving files or dumping photos, etc.  Certainly a more power and cost friendly alternative then keeping a pc turned on to serve the same purpose. With that said, there’s nothing that stands out as special about this drive.  It just does exactly what it was designed to do.  Whether or not to choose this Seagate 500GB drive over [insert brand name here]’s drive is entirely up to you and how confident you are in their products.",3,3
N82E16822178113,22-178-113,10/18/2012 1:52:24 PM,Robert P.,Average Among USB 3.0 Drives,4," To start, this is my first foray into USB 3.0 storage.  Like most people, I’m accustomed to the ubiquitous USB 2.0 speed that most external drives use.  This enclosure houses a 7mm Seagate 5400rpm 2.5” drive, therefore it is very quiet and takes up very little space.  To test its performance, I transferred several large video files in the 15GB range to the hard drive using both USB 3.0 and 2.0 ports.  Transfer speed over USB 3.0 reached 110 MB/s, while USB 2.0 could only transfer at 35 MB/s.  Both HDTach and CrystalDiskMark confirm my transfer speeds and clearly show the drive is severely bottlenecked when using USB 2.0."," The plastic enclosure gives it a cheap feel.  Aluminum would have been a better choice as it is more durable, and it is also better at dissipating heat.  It would add to the overall cost, however, and I understand why Seagate would go with plastic in this price range.  You will find no screws to on this external hard drive so getting inside will be a challenge.  Personally, I like to recycle external enclosures with higher capacity drives if I can but that won’t be an easy process with this model.  Yes it voids your warranty, but this drive only comes with 1-year coverage anyway. The bundled USB 3.0 cable is definitely targeting notebook users.  It’s only 18 inches long which makes it awkward to plug into a rear USB 3.0 port on a desktop tower.  The cable is a Micro B Male connector on the hard drive side, if one is interested in using a replacement cable of greater length."," Overall, this expansion drive is comparable to other external drives in its price range.  Nothing special really stands out about this drive.  There’s no backup software included and no carrying case is included.  The hard drive comes pre-formatted and ready to go right out of the box.",5,5

N82E16822178113,22-178-113,10/12/2012 11:17:48 AM,Daniel C.,Fantastic portable drive,5," The Seagate Expansion line of portable hard drives is surprisingly speedy for the size and power requirements. Many older USB 2.0 portable drives required split, or Y shaped, USB cables to support the increased power requirements, however even when connected over USB 2.0 this drive operates without issues. You should feel comfortable knowing that you can plug this drive into any USB 2.0 port and still access your files without the need for external power.Regarding speed, when connected over USB 3.0 this drive fared very well against a similar internal 2.5 in Seagate laptop at 7200 RPM connected over eSATA/SATA II with only about a 5% speed difference when compared to internal drive. Using USB 3.0, I was able to reach a maximum read transfer speed of 105.3 MB/s and an average of 82.7 MB/s. The write speeds were of similar speeds, only varying by approximately 2-3 MB/s per test result. Several results have knocked this drive for lacking in burst speeds, however I was able to far exceed maximum sustained writes by a large amount, reaching up to 181.9 MB/s during read burst tests and 144.2 MB/s during write bursts. This drive performs extremely well for being a portable drive and may in fact exceed the performance of many 5400 RPM desktop drives."," This drive is quite solid all around and shows no operational drawbacks. The drive enclosure and accessories could use a few tweaks though. The enclosure itself looks quite nice with an all black finish, however the enclosure is slightly flimsy. When squeezing on the center of the drive, it's very easy to make the plastic flex inward and touch the drive. It gives the feeling that the enclosure is a little too light and cheap to keep the drive safe. The USB cable is also extremely short, only reaching about a foot or so. While it's nice to have a shorter cable with use for a laptop, it's extremely short for use with desktop USB ports. A slightly longer cable would be a nice addition for this drive."," Overall, this drive is fast, it's lightweight, it's low powered and Seagate offers a number of online tools for supporting this drive. It's extremely user friendly and forgiving, offering a very flexible case which should help protect against small drops when not in operation. This should be a great addition to anyone looking to add additional space to a laptop or small desktop.All benchmarks below were obtained between PassMark's Disk performance test and HD Tune Pro. Please note that the USB 2.0 speeds were only listed for comparison reasons. The USB 2.0 speed limitation is because of the limitation of the USB 2.0 speed.Read benchmarks:Min: 47.4 MB/sMax: 105.3 MB/sAverage: 82.7 Mb/sAccess time: 17.2 msBurst Rate: 181.9 MB/sWrite benchmarks:Min: 29.7 MB/sMax: 104.7 MB/sAverage: 81.6 MB/sAccess time: 13.9 msBurst rate: 144.2 MB/sUSB 2.0 Read/Write:Min: 31.1 MB/sMax: 33.4 MB/sAverage: 33.3 MB/sAccess time 17.3 msburst rate: 33.4 MB/s",1,1

The drive is powered off the USB port alone so there's no need for external power. USB 3.0 offers huge performance gains over USB 2.0 (see Other Thoughts). A USB 3.0 drive like this is perfect for laptop users who are looking for large amounts of fast, external storage.The only software included on the drive is for Seagate's registration. There's no unnecessary bloatware or vendor-specific backup software to deal with. Just plug it in and do what you want with it. Definitely better than drives that come pre-loaded with a bunch of junk software."," The USB cable is disappointingly short. At only a foot and a half it limits which ports you have easy access to on a desktop. If you have a desktop computer, front USB 3.0 ports are definitely preferable with a cable this short. The cable length should be much less of a factor for owners of laptop computers (which is generally the intended audience for portable drives anyway). Thankfully, longer USB 3.0 cables can be found fairly cheap online (Newegg offers several in the $5 range).Only comes with a 1-year warranty. WD, Toshiba, and ADATA offer 3-year warranties on their similarly priced 500GB USB 3.0 drives. Samsung offers 2 years on their drive. Even Seagate offers 2 years on their higher-end GoFlex drive (priced the same on Newegg as of the writing of this review). I wouldn't be concerned about the reliability of Seagate's drives and warranty certainly shouldn't be the only reason to buy a drive but it's something to consider when comparing similarly-priced products.", Overall the drive offers great performance combined with clean aesthetics. USB 3.0 offers massive performance gains over USB 2.0. This drive pulls 32MB/s sequential reads and 34MB/s sequential writes over USB 2.0. Plug it into a USB 3.0 port and those numbers jump to 110MB/s reads and 115MB/s writes.Seagate's got a solid drive on their hands with the Expansion series. If you need external storage and the fast data transfers USB 3.0 offers then this drive may be just what you're looking for.,1,1

I'm sure it will be fine. However, I would have gladly paid an extra $5-$10 for a portable drive that used an aluminum shell.-The included software is thoughtful, but leaves a lot to be desired in functionality and ease of use.

Not sure why, other than the 500Gb difference between drives, perhaps Seagate streamlined their controller?Comparing this to the previous generation of Seagate USB3.0 Expansion drives (of which I own the 1Tb flavor), this drive is smaller in all dimensions and is small enough to fit in the back pocket of my Jeans (not like I would ever keep it there - I just find it amusing. 500Gb in my pocket). This drive also has a status LED, something the previous Seagate Expansion drives did not have.The only way this drive could be better is if it had a more solid-feeling case. Again, I have no concerns in the long run about the integrity of the drive, but I do appreciate it when manufacturers go the extra mile to prove they take the quality of their products very seriously.All around, Seagate reaffirms my belief in them being the kings of the portable HDD market.",1,1

Testing it with file transfers from a software RAMDisk, moving my lossless audio files (wma lossless, around 30 MB apiece), I got 100 MB/s read, 80-115 MB/s write. That's pretty good for a 2.5 inch hard drive! USB 3.0 is worth the price in that regard, especially since it's backwards compatible. Sleeping the hard drive via power savings options will not require unplugging and replugging!"," Remember to plan for USB 2.0. If you get used to a five minute transfer, and suddenly it's fifteen (like I measured), then you're going to be disappointed. That should be expected, but it's worth mentioning. You will get used to the speed. Also, lots of small files will bring the speed down quite a bit, especially when you're not transferring from the fastest possible storage (1866MHz RAMDisk in my case). Using a """"normal"""" hard drive, a 500 GB Samsung, and USB 3.0, I was achieving just slightly better than the USB 2.0 test with small files. Big files started taking advantage of sequential read/write and were very fast (111-131 MB/s) but that's a niche case. The included """"software"""" does nothing but register the device---no automated backup utility here! Finally, the case is fine, but not what I'd call rugged; there's a fair amount of flex, especially in the large surfaces on top and bottom, the cable is very short (30 cm or so), and with no visible screws, I assume that there is little hope of home-service with the device should it fail outside of warranty."," Often, with these devices, after my needs have outgrown their capacity, I find myself with a large, cumbersome device that no longer satisfies my needs and becomes essentially useless. This one, though, is small, light, and just sips power from one USB port---it's much better than the equivalent device from 5 years ago (have an old 500GB Seagate drive based upon dual 3.5"""" hard drives, yuck). So, coming from that, it's great. It's also exactly what an on-site backup should be: fast. That said, remember that you need an off-site backup too. Lastly, and this is a personal thing, my computer can actually put this device to sleep AND wake it up. That's the only noise I ever hear from it---the initial spin-up. Everything else is quieter than the fans in a Corsair 600T.",1,1

If you’re going to use this on a usb 2.0 port it will fully saturate the port regardless of what you’re copying essentially. All my figures will reflect the hard drive on a usb 3.0 port. Using HD Tune 4.6 the hard drive scored this for the following.Read Speeds: Minimum, 48 Megabytes/s. Maximum 112.6 Megabytes/s. Average 85.5 Megabytes/s. Burst rate 163.3 Megabytes/s. Access time 17.2ms. Write Speeds: Minimum, 44.6 Megabytes/s. Maximum 111.2 Megabytes/s. Average 84.3 Megabytes/s. Burst rate 119.6 Megabytes/s.

Unfortunately I do not have usb 3.0 ports on any of my computers with ssd’s in them."," Case is entirely made of plastic; it has a somewhat cheap feel to it. My previous Seagate external hard drive (freeagent go series) case felt more solid than this case. While I do not expect this one to fall apart any time soon it just has the feel of being not as sturdy as the previous one (reason for the 1 loss of egg rating). The only other con that comes to mind is that the usb 3.0 cable is very stiff; it has an inflexibility to it. That and the connector going to the hard drive is not micro usb but the new usb 3.0 connector so it’s different which means one more cable standard to adhere to. And if you happen to misplace it you’re probably not going to have a spare lying around yet like you would with mini usb or micro usb. There is no backup software included, but from my experience most of that software is next to useless so it plays no role in my rating at all.", While I took off one egg for the physical feel of the case and not as solid construction as the previous generation it would not stop me from recommending this hard drive or line of drives to someone looking for a small external hard drive if the price was right. It has solid performance speed wise and when looking for an external hard drive that is the most important feature in my mind.,1,1

When copying over videos I got over 100 megabytes/second transfer speeds. The casing is very minimalistic, very discrete. There is a light under the casing that is only visible when powered on. The drive make no noise at all. The casing vibrates a little, but it shouldn't cause any noise or disturbance unless sitting on loose/wobbly surfaces. The casing has rubber feet as to not scratch surfaces, and to reduce vibration as well. So it's safe for use on glass. USB 3.0 is always a plus; it's how this drive is so fast. Also, it requires just one simple & easy to use cable."," The cable is a bit short. It should be plenty for what it's intent is, but as I said, it's a bit short. (About 1.5 feet) There does not seem to be a way to open the casing without breaking it, or voiding the warranty, so you can't swap out drives in the enclosure and use it for another drive. Though the power/data cable is built well, it's an interface I've never seen before. Nothing to be wary of, but it does get a little warm. Not hot, just warm."," This is a great little solution for anyone who wants a quick, large-capacity storage device. It's silent. It's sleek. It's fast. I'm VERY pleased to have it. I wish it was possible to change drives inside the enclosure, but that's not a big deal for my needs. The cable for the device is one I've never seen, so if it's lost you may have to go directly to the manufacturer to get a new one. You can just go to the store and buy a typical USB-data cable like most of the portable drives I've seen use. The LED is very small, just a few milimeters in diameter. And it's not overly, or obnoxiously, bright. The color is blue.

I set it up to keep backups, but I also run a small youtube channel and it's handy to write to this external harddrive so I can shuttle footage between PCs. However, this device plain stops working if it's left alone for more than a few days, a week at most. Kinda hard to have autobackups (especially when they provide you software to do so) when the thing won't work properly.Additionally, once the device stops functioning properly it is always registered as 'in use' even when it isn't. No back up is running, no files are open, yet the device will not let you eject.If on the off chance I'm uploading a video to youtube from the device and it stops working, it fails to upload at around 95% or so with my luck (which makes a frustrating situation already more frustrating). And no files can be accessed while the device is in this state, even though you can still technically OPEN the drive, you cannot view files, or if you already had one of the folders open, all of the data appears as corrupt.The only fix I've found is to shut down the PC entirely and once off, remove the device. After that, booting the PC and plugging it back in, all files return to normal and the issue is gone. Because of the sheer annoyance alone I would rate this two out of five, tops."," It's great when it works, but this is by far the most annoying, temperamental external harddrive I've ever owned.",1,1

S.M.A.R.T. data.Model: WDC WD10JMVW-11S5XS0Firmware: 01.01A01LBA: 1953458176Cache size: 8192 KBRPM: 5400SATA Gen2 3.0 Gb/s: Supported2. Very portable.The drive is quite small (4.4"" x 3.3"") and light weight. The drive is powered by USB (no separate power supply/cable to carry around).If you attach the drive through a USB hub, assure the hub is independently powered. The drive draws under one watt of power, but multiple devices connected to the same hub can create power issues.3. Two year warranty (with 30 day free phone support).I'd prefer 3-5 years. Register your drive on the WD warranty web site. Just enter the drive serial number, the site does the rest. For every drive you register, it lists: when the warranty expires, direct links to software and manuals for each drive, etc.I also own a 750GB WD drive (bought over a year ago) which is still working fine. It is the same physical size, but weighs more, and has a significantly lower maximum data rate of 45MB/sec (vs. 70MB/sec for the 1TB).4. Physical appearance.My old 750GB is all black with a high gloss finish. Every fingerprint is visible on my old drive. The new blue/black 1TB drive by contrast is textured and hides most fingerprints, a noticeable improvement.I find the blue/black color scheme useful to identify the different drives at a glance.5. USB 3.0 (2.0 compatible).Drive performance is good (exceeds USB 2.0). I measured USB 2.0 performance at 25MB/sec Read, 29MB/sec Write.All hard drives are faster when empty than full. This is simply because the circumference of the Outside diameter (OD) of the disk is larger than the Inside diameter (ID).With Verify, I measured 70MB/sec on the OD (empty) dropping to 40MB/sec on the ID (full). USB 3.0 can expect a speed increase of 2.5X (empty disk) to 1.5X (disk about full).Drive temperature was reasonable (not fantastic). I measured 45C while writing 500GB to the drive (ambient was 25C).6. Drive is formatted for Windows (NTFS) but can be reformatted to FAT32, or to Mac.Reformatting the drive (e.g. for Mac) wipes out the software which is packaged on the drive. You can either copy the software off before format, or download the software from the WD web page after format.7. The drive includes the following software. You can choose what you want to install. - WD Drive Utilities - WD  Security - WD  SmartWare (not available on Mac)You should install the WD SES Device Driver (a tiny 15KB file) the same version came with my 750GB drive. Both drives passed all the WD diagnostics.The various WD software packages allow you to exploit many optional features of the drive. For example, you can set the Drive Sleep Timer (duration of inactivity before the drive spins down), Password protect the drive, etc."," 1. The drive inside the enclosure is SATA, however from what I've read, WD packages the SATA/USB bridge directly on the drive controller board (note: I did not open the enclosure to verify this).This means the SATA/USB bridge is not a separate card that can be removed from the drive. The up side is physical space savings (and likely WD production cost). The down side is you can not remove the drive and plug it directly into a SATA connector in a PC, Laptop, or third party enclosure.This also means you have no easy way to recover your data if the USB hardware (only) were to fail. I had the USB hardware on another (non WD) drive fail. It wasn't a big problem since I could move the drive to another enclosure and install the drive directly into my PC to access my files.I was close, but did not deduct an Egg for this.2. The length of the USB cable is relatively short (16""). This is due in part because the drive obtains all power through USB. The up side is there is no need for a separate power cord (or power supply) which improves portability.3. WD does not include a case with the drive. The manual (softcopy pdf file on the drive) refers you to WD web site to purchase accessories separately. Prices start around $5.00. I found it useful to purchase a case with an internal pocket to store the USB cable."," 1. Backup software.There are numerous Backup software solutions for PCs. I prefer to just ""drag and drop"" files from my PC to my various external drives (I own many drives from different vendors). The down side is you must manage the backups yourself (and remember to do them periodically). This is my own personal preference (and why the focus of my review has been the hardware).Always remember any PC hardware can fail (e.g. hard drive, SSD, Flash drive, memory stick, DVD, CD, etc.). If you don't want to loose your your precious  files, maintain (at least) two copies on different media. Its unlikely both copies will fail simultaneously (excluding a fire or flood). Focus your backup on the files you created yourself (e.g. text files, spread sheets, tax returns, photos, etc.). Most software and operating systems files can be restored from the original installation disks.2. All hard drives have delicate moving parts inside.This WD drive is very portable while powered off, but never move any hard drive while its in use. Moving a drive while it is powered on can cause the drive to fail (e.g. head crash). Copy (don't move) files to any new drive for the first few weeks (to assure you didn't get a lemon drive). Run the WD Lifeguard Diagnostics Utility to initially check out the drive, and again later, if you suspect the drive may be failing.3. At the risk of stating the obvious, if you password protect your drive, do NOT forget your password.The only way to unlock the drive (without the password) is to reformat the entire drive. All your files will be lost. The up side is you have confidence nobody will have access to your files without the password (not even you).4. A common drive capacity misunderstanding.The capacity of this drive is 1953458176 (LBAs) * 512 bytes = 1,000,170,586,112 bytes (do the math yourself). Windows reports the capacity as 931GB (not 1TB). This is because Windows reports drive capacity in binary, but drive vendors use decimal.In Windows, 1KB = 1,024 binary (not the decimal 1,000 used by drive vendors). To convert the decimal capacity above to binary (what Windows reports) just divide the 13 digit decimal number above by 1024 three times (to convert to GBs). You'll get: 931.4814453125. Do the math yourself, but use a scientific calculator (or the one on your PC) not an 8 digit pocket calculator.",7,9

I opened the case, and low and behold, there was a samsung spinpoint m9t with 2000GB of storage on it, in a standard 9.5mm chassis, and with a standard SATA plug. I am happily copying 1.2 terrabytes of movies to the drive as I type this. The case, while easily opened, is impossible to open without at least a small amount of scoring and damage- and I ended up bending the blue aluminum piece enough to destroy the utility of the case when opening it. It's reasonably fast for a drive of this capacity at this price point- Im averaging about 60-70MB/s in the drive to drive transfer from a 1tb WDC drive. I would like to repeat myself on one point... THIS DRIVE, WHILE 2TB IN SIZE, WILL NOT CORRECTLY SNYCH WITH A PLAYSTATION 4. There are a couple of  jerry-rigging tricks you can use to make it boot successfully most of the time, but an HGST K1500 will get you 75% of the drivespace, and require non of the tricks to use, it will just work. If upgrading your brand new current gen gaming console is your goal, then the HGST drive is a MUCH better choice. Just saying..."," I have a couple of concerns over longevity. Obviously, since this is day one, we know nothing of that, yet... but I have my concerns, and those concerns are based on the business plan behind this drive. Why no bare drive available? Well, one possible reason to NOT market this device that way would be a high failure rate- because by opening the enclosure, I've voided my warranty, so if it dies tomorrow morning, I have no recourse. If it dies prematurely, I will post a followup review reflecting that fact, but it is worth noting that the failure rates on ALL hard disk drives go up orders of magnitude when you breach 1tb... no idea why, but ask anyone that works in a datacenter with a lot of nearline storage, and they will tell you the same."," Im now running 4tb of platters, and a pair of 120gb SSDs... all internally installed into a single laptop.

Short life span of only 1 year"," This drive was purchased for friend who used it for backing up files for work.  Instead of using it just for backup, it ended up being the repository of over 8 years of business financials, forms, and generalized operational work documents.  Although the drive was seldom used, it failed at just over 1 year. All you could barely hear was about 10 rapid beeps, then NOTHING. Since it is a Seagate drive housed in a Samsung case, I used SeaTools (Seagate diagnostic suite) to check the drive. On 3 of 5 tests the report was a total failure of the drive. Windows would not see it, BIOS would not see it, and the owner was totally in panic.I conducted data recovery method to extract 141 GB of files off the drive and save the information. The heads of the drive were totally crashed, and it was lucky that any information was extracted at all.Called Samsung, and their excellent support team went through a full RMA process that has a new replacement expedited at no charge, that will arrive in 3-5 business days. NOTE: These drives should not be your ONLY COPY of your information. All drives do fail and that is why you use these as a backup/portable solution, but not the only place you store your files. If it is your only copy, and it does fail, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! YOU WILL LOSE YOUR DATA.... Period. Use a cloud based backup like SkyDrive or Google Drive... to keep your data safe. I buy external cases which are USB 3.0 ($5-$6.00) and slap in a regular SATA 2.5"" laptop hard drive. Saves you money, and IMHO, seem to last a lot of years compared to these sealed drives.

Then remove the drive, slide in external case... and VOILA!  No matter what changes, you always have a copy!",None,None

True, the specifications are listed right there in the product’s description, but until I actually received it and opened it up, I didn’t realize just how compact it really was.  Absolutely perfect!  It fits almost anywhere, practically unobtrusive in any way.  The USB cable length is sufficient, although I wouldn’t have complained if it had been a little longer, but it does the job so it’s not really a complaint.  I plugged it right into my USB3.0 port and it reads and writes at 40MB/s,  +/- 5MB/s.  I transferred a few 10GB files multiple times as well as a few much smaller files to attain an average transfer speed.It’s quiet, cool, and looks nice.  Very portable, light, and relatively inexpensive.  I loaned it to my son so he could backup his boot drive’s personal files as he was in the process of upgrading his internal drives and re-installing his OS.  The Samsung performed flawlessly.  Of the many options for backing up his files, we found simply plugging this drive into the USB port on his system and backing up was the easiest and quickest, relative to backing up on one of his old internals, copying back, then replacing the old internal, or using a clunky external drive bay."," I can’t think of anything negative regarding this drive, as I haven’t experienced anything but positive results using it, other than the relatively short cable as mentioned earlier.",,8,8

The USB3 connectors are very sturdy so they don't disconnect easily.The size is both very small and thin, and therefore is a much better solution than comparative portable hard drive solutions for portability. In fact, the size is essentially that of a wallet, and therefore fits snuggly in your pockets.After extensive benchmarking of the drive, I've come to the conclusion that the drive does a very good job at random read/writes and, regardless of filesize, throughput is roughly about the same. Throughput is around 30-40MB/sec for read/writes with small and large files alike, and access time is 17 msec.Considering the size, low power consumption, and the lack of heat generated from the drive, this is a pretty good speed for storage of media.At the current price of $70, I would highly recommend purchasing one."," There's nothing bad to say about the drive. It's small, energy-efficient, and has high storage capacity. However, the included USB3.0 cable is rather short, so expect to place the drive either on top of the PC or somewhere directly adjacent to the system."," Don't get this if you are looking for a fast drive with 100+MB/s transfer rates; look for a different, larger portable USB3 drive.

While great for power savings and whatnot, the constant spin-up delay and pauses in drag-n-drop operations are beyond annoying.So if you get one that does that, exchange it as a defective product as it's not practically usable.

Turns out this was a bad idea.Much like the infuriating U3 fiasco that SanD*sk is STILL engaging in, WD had decided to include a bunch of extra trash in the firmware of the drive.  Specifically, they emulate a virtual CD drive and some other hardware device.  You can configure the VCD drive to not appear to the host operating system (after updating the firmware of the drive and running a special tool) but you cannot do anything about the extra hardware which results in a New Hardware Found wizard appearing EVERY time you plug in the drive.  These two factors alone drop 3 eggs.Also, it seems like WD might have tried to do something about the connection problems.  The small ""hooks"" on the bottom of the micro USB connector now lock in place in the drive making the USB cable is nearly impossible to remove"," More cons:The shiny black finish looks good at first, but as soon as you touch it you'll wish it was matte black instead.  Fingerprints and dust stand out like spotlights and the surface scratches really easily.The USB cable is pretty short, but this was the case with older WD drives as well so I pretty much expected this.  What's more annoying is that the cable is micro-USB so you can't use an older mini-USB cable you probably have laying around.Other thoughts:It seems like hardware manufacturers feel a constant need to unnecessarily make their devices more ""user friendly"".  It might be a nice idea, but unfortunately they almost always get it wrong.I will be returning this drive for a refund and will look for something else which does NOT impose stupid hardware requirements on me.Western Digital: All we want is a USB mass storage device.

Loses connectivity easily.Slow/low-performance, but to be expected with a small, high-capacity, USB-powered drive."," Nice capacity, but the cable/connector seems designed to make it unusable. The cable is very short (19"" tip-to-tip), requiring a flat spot immediately adjacent to your laptop. Forget about using this thing on an airplane, an easy chair, etc. Attaching it to a tower desktop with USB ports up top, the cable is too short to reach the desk. I need to try it with a USB extender cable, but I wonder if maybe the line drivers in the drive can't power a longer cable. That would explain why it disconnects if you look at it cross-eyed. Using it on my Mac, it was there, then it wasn't, then it was, over and over. I had to keep my Macbook, the drive, and the cable absolutely motionless to make it work.  I'm used to eSATA connectors where the connector was specifically designed to be secure and not easily dislodged. Not so the micro-USB connector used in this drive. The micro-USB is a new standard connector, but is seems like a giant step backward in reliability. Should have used the old mini-USB.",1,5

It is a nightmare to get rid of for those of us who don't care for it. The partition that hosts the bundled software is write protected via the drive's firmware - talk about overkill, WD. This partition cannot be removed, the best we can do is try and hide it. So I flashed the drive's firmware to the latest revision and used an app ( both from the wdc site ) to 'hide' the partition. This is half the problem - the other problem is that windows boxes detect a 'WD SES Device' and launches the new hardware wizard everytime the drive is plugged in. Of course you can hit 'Cancel' everytime in return for a standard 'Your driver installation was not successful, your new hardware may not work properly' balloon in the system tray.When I pay good money for hardware, I'm also paying for the freedom to NOT use the bundled crapware. USB Mass Storage driver is good enough for me to operate the USB external drive"," Talked to support and confirmed my understanding above.5 egg for the hardware.1 egg for unremovability of bundled software/release of storage for the same.NOTE: 1 egg is not a review for the software. It is for unnecessarily locking it in place.Even if I 'fix' my computer by hunting down and installing the 'SES' device driver, the client I'm handing this drive to will get  -a) a driver installation dialog to cancel out ofb) a message on unsuccessful driver installationFor something that is completely avoidable.. shameful. The reputation of my business data transaction can now be tarnished by the storage media I use to transport the same because WD has ruled out all the other choices.This drive is going back to the store - I'll get another 500GB which I know well and like. Until WD releases firmware revision that unlocks the entire device and expose every addressable bit to the OS and thereby allow removal of the VDC crapware, they can keep this drive.",57,60

I have been using it everyday since I got it for hours at a time. It is very simple to use (plug, format and play). Xbox had no issues finding the drive and I have never had any issues with the Xbox not recognizing the drive. The design is simple, which I actually like. There is only one cable which is good for me. This means that the drive gets its power from whatever it is connected to and there is no need to plug it in to an electrical outlet. I play ALL my games from this hard drive as the Xbox reads USB 3.0 hard drives faster than the internal that it comes with. Transferring games to the hard drive is quick and seamless. The only negative I have is that the cable that it comes with is super short so I had to leave the hard drive at the back of my console here it runs a bit warm.  Great product.

[Simplified: Expect to reconnect the drive in Windows XP 32-bit for large file transfers (+40GBytes).Hard Disk Drive:  The physical hard disk drive of this specific model contains a different physical interface than your typical SATA/IDE HDD.  It is physically incompatible with current mainstream HDD interfaces making this drive useless for swapping out other internal/external HDDs that require a SATA/IDE interface. Opinion:  As for reasons why this HDD is made like this one can only guess but one standpoint is that fact that it removes the need for extra adapters to convert to a USB interface and helps shrink the overall size of the external enclosure.," My only major misgiving about this HDD is the SATA/IDE incompatibility, it makes itself useless beyond its own enclosure for us low-tech DIY hobbyists.  Very few avenues are left with this device to allow to be useable in other electronics, but one possibility is to research the PCBs on similar WD HDDs that use a SATA inferace and whether they are interchangeable, basically changing the interface on the HDD.

While overall it is a good, reliable drive over the past 8 months (and I use it heavily and daily to download subscription music), it goes to ""sleep"" after 5 minutes or so and I can't find a way to stop it.  The result is that, after not file browsing for a few minutes, it takes 10-15 seconds to wake back up.  This is unacceptable for DJ'ing, as I may need to bring a new song in quickly.However for general purpose storage, and non-realtime applications, it works fine.

So, to start backup went fine reaching 90-100Mb/second on big files. Movies, videos, ISOs etc.Once backup went to smaller files and windows cache is filled, drive shown its downside. As per Windows 8.1 write speed fluctuating around 10-30Mb/s, while 100% busy. Copy starts fast until sending drive saturated write back cache of the PC. While receiving 4TbSeagate cannot consume it fast enough. And files sent are not that big, these are 16mb raw images from my cameras.I presume it is where new SMR technology kicks in. SMR, Shingled magnetic recording. You can easily google it. In order to write data, it has to read first, and write this data along with a new data. This takes big performance hit, involving extra read operations. While on bigger files it involves less head positioning, on small once extra heads positioning for reads multiplying and these time consuming component takes it's toll.That's why reviews are so vary, drive fast, while comes to almost stall on smaller files. If speed is not that important compared to price per gigabyte, than this drive is for you. Otherwise you can go with praised Seagate 2Tb slim drives, which based on Samsung M9T slim 2Tb. This drives easily gives 90-120Mb/S in absolutely same conditions.So drive is not that bad in some cases, I hope my post will save time and money for the returns in case of demanding users which has a 2Tb drives performance in mind",11,13

The drive is formatted with a GPT partition so that you have access to all of the space on the drive.  Should you choose to reformat it as a MBR partition then you will only be able to access 2TB.  The drive works very well and I am completely satisfied with this purchase.," The USB 3.0 cable is a bit on the short side.    <update 7-20-2016> There seems to be a compatibility issue between the Gigabyte GA-Z97-HD3P motherboard and this drive when a Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse are plugged in to one USB 3.0 port and the 4TB drive in the other.  If you unplug the Logitech unified  receiver then the drive works fine or if you plug the 4TB drive into a different USB 3.0 port the drive works fine.  The two ports are connected to the 20 pin USB 3./2.0 connector on the motherboard.   I have not been able to pinpoint what is causing the incompatibility issue, but I wanted to mention it since some are reporting errors and other problems using this drive."," You can store a tremendous video and/or music library on this drive and still have space left over for a bunch of backups.

I used to tear down older mac minis and make them a lot faster with bigger  hdds for friends and family.  SO I have purchased hundreds of hdds and put them inside lots of macs.  Since newer macs do not let you get at hdds that easy I am always on the lookout for good external portable hdds.  This drive is great for what I want.

I can boot on any of my 3 mac minis using this.  I can then rescue any info on the internal mac mini's hdd and clone it to the  blank partition.Finally since I have so much room I can shrink the 3tb boot size and expand the 1tb rescue blank partition  so if the mac in need has 2tb of info I am still good.This item is almost perfect for my needs .

N82E16822178744,22-178-744,6/13/2015 10:39:33 AM,Mark P.,Great Portable Drive,5, This is a great little unit with tons of space.  I did some testing with the 3.0 USB ports on my computer and copied about 75 GB of data that needed backed up.  It typically transferred at about 85 MB/sec.  These numbers can be affected by so many things that I can't really say if this was really good or just okay.  For me it was fine. Size and weight are perfect for taking with you in the computer case or backpack.  Very light weight and simple design.  It has a blue LED to show when the harddrive is being accessed that you wouldn't even know was there until it turns on which to me says that some thought went into the case design. This unit comes with some software that is used to register the device with Seagate for warranty purposes.  I guess this is a nice feature.," My only con for this unit is that it doesn't have a case included.  Every other portable harddrive I've ever purchased had a small padded case to keep the harddrive and cable together and ready to use.  I actually misplaced the cable for a couple days and had to use one from another portable harddrive I had.  The other complaint is with the cable length of around a foot in length.  I'm sure some people would complain that the cable was too long if it was longer and there are people like me complaining that it's too short so this really just comes down to user preference.  Maybe they've done a study and found that one foot is the preferred length.  For me though, I prefer to have the portable harddrive out of the way and one foot means that it's in the way when it's attached to the laptop.Last complaint is that I attempted to use this as a backup/media drive attached to my router and the router would not recognize the harddrive as a storage device.  This could be the router or the harddrive...I have no way of knowing without a lot of investigation.  It's not that big of a deal since this device probably isn't designed to be on 24/7 so this really isn't that big of a problem."," Overall I really like this unit.  I would recommend it based on capacity, weight, and a really nice design.",3,4

It’s 1 TB size (931 GB formatted under Windows NTFS) is roomy for such a small package.  It’s also very speedy when connected to a USB 3.0 port.  The textured surface is a nice touch and it’s very lightweight, making it an easy addition to any laptop bag or “go” bag.Here’s a few numbers.  All speed tests performed in Windows 8.1 and transfers were from a solid state drive.  Plugged into a USB 2.0 port, a single large file (1.1 GB) took 36 seconds, averaging 30.5 MB/s.  A large folder of photos (5.8 GB) took 2 minutes 40 seconds, averaging 36.4 MB/s.

Pretty awesome when it’s time to do a backup.Overall this is a great little drive, but I must remove one star for the lack of value.  The drive is $69.99 at the time of this writing.

About one foot in length. I think this was a compromise they made because longer USB extension cords don't work. I've tried. I guess there was only so much they could do on USB power alone.Others have mentioned disconnects. This does happen if you touch the USB cable end while transferring data. I leave it alone when moving data and I can live with this because the drive is so fast. Just FYI, I have had no trouble getting most USB 2 only connections on this drive to work just fine.

9SIA7U13RH9242,22-236-189,11/5/2012 9:29:45 AM,Justin E.,Mine has been working fine thus far,3," The drive is small and lightweight but feels pretty solid. The casing feels sturdy and well-built.  The plastics also have a very nice look and feel to them.  Having a single cable for power and data is very nice (especially for a large capacity drive like this one).   I have another HDD of the same capacity/style from another company and this one feels much nicer.  I like the fact that these can be easily stowed in a bag or pocket without issues.  Currently, this drive is being used as a backup device for a NAS at my home.Speeds are quite decent and right on par for what is expected from this type of drive.  Speeds are listed down in the ""Other Thoughts"" section. The LED light on the front is a nice touch for showing activity/power/connection.  Came with some drive replication software and some other things on the drive out of the box.  I formatted over all of it as it isn’t much use to me.  Although, this is a nice touch for a user that just needs to migrate a drive without hassle. In the box is also a small quick start guide.  Although, I’m not sure how many people are unaware of how to connect a cable to the drive and connect the drive to the computer."," Remember that LED light in the Pros?  Well here are the issues with it.  When the drive is inactive, the light just sits there and blinks at a regular interval constantly.  This wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't for the fact that the light illuminates an entire room by itself.  A tiny piece of electrical tape seems to have remedied this issue pretty quickly.Speed is slightly slower than my other drive of the same capacity (also a single cable USB3.0 design).  The response time is very slow (spin up takes a long time from off; longer than any other mechanical drive I have in use) so it takes a long time to wake the thing up and start moving things.While it seems to suffer of absolutely no problems through USB2.0, it seems to be sort of choosy about what USB3.0 chipsets it likes.  I have a few devices here that all have USB3.0 capabilities.  Some of them transfer files back and forth beautifully.  I really put this drive through a lot of file moves and deletes on each device to really test it out.  I will preface this by saying that one of the USB3.0 chipsets on a PC I have here has a lot of problems with device compatibility.  This drive did not work with it.  You start a file transfer and the connection will drop somewhere around a minute in.  Other USB3.0 drives have done this on this PC but some seem to suffer absolutely no problems.  Using USB2.0 on this computer yields typical results.  I can only assume that some USB3.0 devices and chipsets in the early stages of this technology aren't that compatible (the motherboard on the PC is about a year old so it is pretty close to the first of motherboards introduced with USB3.0 built in).When the USB3.0 side of this device works, it performs well but not as fast as some of the other drives with the same specs (1TB capacity, small form factor, and single cable design) which is mostly why I had to knock an egg off.  If you are having connectivity issues on USB3.0 with this device I would probably venture to guess that you are facing the same issue as I have observed with certain USB3.0 chipsets interfacing with one another."," Speeds over all were pretty decent.  Moving 20GB of ~4.5MB (each) mp3 files to the drive using USB2.0 averaged around 25MB/s over about 10 transfer sessions.Moving 950 GB of 4-32GB .mkv files yielded a slightly lower 23MB/s over 10 times on USB2.0.  This drive slows down pretty significantly while writing toward the very edge of its capacity (but that is (pretty common).loading 500GB of random files (documents, music, movies etc. ranging from 1K to 20GB) averaged around 23GB/s for USB2.0USB3.0 (as expected) yields much faster speeds.transferring the same amount of music as mentioned above ran at 45MB/s for the duration of the transfer tests.transferring the same amount of movies as mentioned above came in at 44.5MB/s for the average.transferring the same batch of random files from above averaged 42MB/s.I will say that the drive became very warm (almost concerning) during testing on USB3.0 with a very large batch of files.  Obviously, the typical use for this drive will most likely not involve transferring almost 1TB of data every time it is used but this is something to think about if that is your intention with the drive.The drive did suffer from disconnecting/reconnecting during testing on the aforementioned computer with USB3.0.  However, another computer I have on hand did not suffer from the disconnects during transfers.I did have to take another egg off for this as I can see how it would be very frustrating for a user to deal with this long term (especially if this user is using this drive on multiple computers).",11,11

Then it would randomly disconnect during transfers. It seemed to work just fine with the usb 2.0 port, but that defeats the purpose. I called WD technical support. They sent me a new cable (which was much thicker than the cable which was packaged with the My Passport drive). That did not solve the problem. The next step was the RMA process. Now I have to pay to send this defective, sub-standard item back to Newegg.After the replacement arrives, it's the same unacceptable  situation. The usb 3.0 refuses to work. Now for those of you who are thinking it could be my usb port, I have successfully used an external 3.0 usb hard drive from another manufacturer on this same computer. No disconnects and good transfer speeds. Now if I return this to Newegg, I will not only have to pay for return shipping, I will be subject to a 15% restocking fee."," I am going to keep it and use it as a usb 2.0 device.

Then again it could be just the one i have i did try a different USB3 cable but it made little to no difference. If all you are  saving to it is pictures and files you should be good but for larger files you want something faster, no one wants to wait for 20 minutes to back up a 1 gig file if its that fast.This might work great for those not in a hurry but if you have a few extra dollars to spend id do it and get one that benchs alot faster.

9SIA7U13RH9242,22-236-189,10/26/2012 9:43:32 AM,Edward E.,"Nice drive, avoid the software",4," * Compact design, cool looking crosshatch design on top.* Uses the standard USB 3.0 cable* Reputable brand* Quiet* 80MB/s read and write speeds on USB 3.0", * The software.  It's actually dangerous to use.," If the rating were for the drive itself, I'd give it 5 Eggs.  But since the marketing is about how the software does all sorts of things, 4 Eggs is generous.Not reading the warnings about the software in the other reviews, I hooked up the drive to a USB 3.0 port and it tested at 80MB/s read and write times.  That's decent speed for a drive intended for backups.Then I installed the software that is included on the drive and used all the defaults, which installs 3 utilities.  It requested a reboot, so OK.  My system usually boots up in about 45 seconds.  This time it took 4 minutes.  Strike 1.So I look at the drive through Windows Explorer and it now shows as empty, so the software hides your existing content.  It also locked the drive so I couldn't copy files directly to it.  You're now captive to their software.Then I checked out an external Seagate USB drive I also have attached - and everything disappered from it, too!  Lots of backups, gone.  Strike 2.To give the software a fair chance, I uninstalled it all, downloaded their latest 1.6.4 version of the SmartWare software and hoped for the best by installing just that one piece.  Rebooted again - once for the uninstall, once for the install.The interrface suggests using the default ""categorized"" backup, which I did.  It then scans your OS drive (no option for more drives, or to change what files go in which category) and shows the following groups: Documents, Mail, Movies, Music, Other, Pictures.  CPU use went high during this scan, which lasted about 10 minutes.Since I have 1.3TB of data to backup, I unchecked a couple until I got to about 900GB of stuff and chose Backup.12 hours later I check on it and my quad-core CPU is pegged at 100%, my system is barely responsive, and the backup software has copied a whopping 36GB of data.  I rebooted and tried again and it did the exact same thing at 35GB.  It was so bad that the system would just hang on an attempted shutdown.  I had to physically power off the machine.  Strike 3.After I finally got my machine rebooted, I uninstalled their software as fast as I could, rebooted, and everything is back to normal.  My Seagate drive also shows its contents again - whew!In summary: The hardware itself appears to be nice.  The software is probably the worst backup software I've ever used (tried to use to be more accurate.)  Even though it has some promise, I'll never try it again based on the above experience.  I only took off 1 Egg because there are many other backup software options available, some of them are free.  They would work well with this drive without the software.  The cost of this drive compared to their Western Digital Elements SE 1TB isn't a lot, which might be the same drive without the software.  Don't know if there's a speed difference.Bottom Line: If you get it, just reformat the drive and use your favorite software, or simply copy files there by hand.  But whatever you do, DO NOT install",10,13

When backing up a large file, the transfer rate would start at around 50mbps and very quickly drop to 200kbps (yes, Kilobytes). Never wanting to judge a product too quickly, I soldiered on with the backup only for this poor excuse of a ""hard drive"" to freeze completely and cause every single app I have opened to ""not responding"" status. Needless to say some of my data was lost in this farce... So much for the old adage ""always backup your work""...After running the WD lifeguard diagnostics, the programme confirmed a HD problem. All I expect now is that WD doesn't make me jump through hoops for the RMA.

When formatted they ALL are roughly 931GB. Whether formatted in HFS+, NTFS, EXT3 or EXT4. So WD didnt take 70 GB of his disk, he just didnt know what he was talking about.Most if not ALL HDD's and SDD's state on the label or packaging that the available space may be less than * (TB,GB,MB) when formatted.

At first you choose what to back up and then it does its thing. And then you try to access it and go WHAT?! You can actually do it through the retrieve section of the software OR it does save a folder (just like you would on a drive without smartware) when you first access the drive from My Computer. Also I have confirmed it does work with XP. Im not sure what happened with that other reviewer.," Was a little confusing at first but once you give it a chance and play around with it, you can gauge its worth."," So my suggestion is to use smartware to do auto backups of pictures, important files and music (things you change all the time); it really isnt as awful as some of these people say, they just didn't take the time to learn how to use it. I would  simply drag other items to the drive just like any other file. I hate seeing others reporting that their drive failed and it does worry me but WD hasn't done me wrong yet.

I own ~20 of them and have used various model iterations since the product line's inception. Usually these drives are very good/reliable.," I have now purchased two of these drives. Both are going back to the retailer (not Newegg, I bought them locally). The first one failed during the first transfer of files (unexpectedly lost connection to the Win7 64bit computer it was connected to). The failure resulted in loss of subdirectories and files after ~250 GB of file transfer (mostly small files < 100k.). Bought another drive to try, this one also failed after first transfer (~400GB), several root directories are corrupted and inaccessible. Two drives in a row failing like this is totally unacceptable. I called support and they could not offer any suggestions apart from returning the drive. This brand is usually good, but I would avoid this generation!"," I wish I hadn't had 15 minutes of my time completely wasted by level 1 tech support.

My 250BG Passport is over 5yrs old now & still good. Until I get brave, crack open the case and void my warranty, I must say Buyer Beware. I just went through an absolute horror story with one of these a couple of months ago. Plugged it into my USB 3 port and it died after less than 60 days. Sent it to WD for repair and they SCRAPPED IT (tagged for refurbished). 15 years of portfolio work gone. Went through much drama and got sent 3 different refurbished replacements, 2 of which were desktop (not what I wanted) and one was DOA. Attempted professional data recovery and that was futile.Here's the problem...the new USB 3 drives WD uses has a controller physically mounted over the entire drive. There are no visible connectors as a normal drive would have. This PCB board is notorious for going bad.If I could crack this open and see that it was a standard notebook hard drive, I would rest much easier. Until then...backups of backups of backup",5,7
9SIA7U13RH9242,22-236-189,5/18/2012 7:30:37 AM,Shane S.,Good BUT with a Horrible Caveat,3," Performs as any other plug-in/removable media straight out of the box.  No hassle in this regard.  Easy to use.  LED is super bright white (pro/con?).Without the terrible software, I would give this a 5-star rating.  But the experience of trying WD's backup software leaves me with a horrible memory of TONS of wasted time fixing the mess their software created.  Again, using it straight out of the box without installing the supplied backup software rates as a 5-egg experience no questions asked.  However, as I succumbed to the marketing of the drive's software (read below), and tried the software, I have a much less favorable opinion of WD now.  I almost bought the Seagate but they require a proprietary cable.  Perhaps the Toshiba would have been a better option than both Seagate and WD as it was cheaper by $10-$20 at the time of purchase."," I bought because of WD's reliability in my experience.  The packaging reads ""WD's backup software automatically creates a second copy whenever you save or add a file.  If you ever lose an important file, find and retrieve it in seconds.""  This seemed like an additional bonus, however, their software caused my system to hang upon booting the PC each time and caused random spikes in CPU use--maxing out the CPU--couldn't do anything on the system thereafter.  This is a great idea with the WORST execution I've ever experienced.  Read the boards, search online, you will find this is a KNOWN ISSUE and a terrible pain to remove.  Use the drive AS-IS out of the box but DO NOT install the WD backup software.  This is very disappointing as I liked the idea of an incremental backup without performing a full backup.  I needed to use CCleaner to remove all WD software as it installed a variety of ugly processes."," The drive works fine as long as you do not install the software that comes loaded on the drive.  I can't imagine why WD doesn't address the software issue as this is one of the reasons I bought the drive -- therein lies their catch.  Again, do your research online first if you are ""tempted"" to install the software that came with the drive.  Consider yourself warned.  I normally wouldn't be so adamant about such things, but the software in this case is HORRIBLE.  It is unusable if it hangs your system, and the reports of this kind are found online.  I also like the idea of the drive supporting USB 3.0, and the price was quite good at BBuy.  Had I not performed a few system backups to the drive I would have returned it, but from a security perspective, I will simply keep the drive.  The LED is bright white and is oddly on the same end as the plug in; somewhat backward design in my opinion.",19,20

So you are essentially in deep trouble if you lose something very important like I did."," I really wish this would work. But if I could get a replacement, it would make me very happy with Western Digital.

When I saw the Element, it appears to be identical to the passport, measurements listed are the same.  After some research, there is a difference in the firmware between the two drive where the passport loads an SCS driver, of what the purpose is, I am not certain.  Perhaps it pertains to being able to encrypt the data on the passport, but that is optional.On this drive there were two folder along with two files.  An Adobe file mentioned the use of the included trial of WD smartware Pro (which is in one of the folders), an auto run file which points to the other folder that contains one file, a WD icon.  So in stock form, when you view your devices from my computer, this drive would have the WD icon by it.  Pretty catchy....Even though the sizes show identical between this and the passport, this drive is actually smaller.  Maybe a 1/16"" shorter in both length and width, and close to an 1/8"" thinner. Perhaps that is the difference in the passport being a 2 TB drive and these being a 1 TB drive, but I wouldn't think so.I use these drives to store OS images on from my various PC's.  Had I know then, when I bought the passport, what I know now, I would most likely just bought whichever one was cheaper at the time.The passport came with the SCS driver and wd smartware (the freebie version which to me is useless, windows backup is more intuitive). and some other software for data encryption, which I wouldn't use anyways.I was just going to get the 500 GB element when it came up on sale, but the 1 TB was only ten bucks more, wasn't on sale.

So it had a little less than 1TB of usable space.It comes with a USB 3 cable that also works at USB 2.

It comes with a USB 3.0 cable."," The drive comes with an insidious hidden WD SmartWare partition that will not go away no matter how many times you reformat the drive - Googling this turns up pages after pages of angry customers asking how to disable this ""feature"". This partition takes up 600MB of space on the drive. Additionally this drive will prompt to install a WD SES USB device - the SmartWare virtual CD - on whatever Windows computer it's connected to. Because of this behavior, it is impossible to connect this to a set-top box or to boot from the drive. For someone who moves frequently from computer to computer, this is unacceptable."," I am aware that WD offers an ""Elements"" version of their drive that doesn't have the SmartWare crapware on it.

I was very impressed with the drive initially, and recommended it to all my friends. But the random, reformatting, and the refusal to format into any other file structure - Fat, Fat32, NTFS, something other than RAW (which is literally useless, by the way) - has made me no longer trust Western Digital for external drives. I've tried everything short of an electromagnet to zero-out the drive, not even DBan can zero out the drive."," This is something that I only noticed every now and again, and only because I had my anti-virus set to scan any removable media upon detection. The drive would occasionally disconnect and reconnect a split second later (after which, my anti-virus would scan it). This only cause me trouble during a file transfer once, and it was while I was copying 100gb of files (the disconnect locked up Teracopy, which crippled Windows Explorer, which prevented me from properly shutting down Windows 7).Western Digital needs to go back to the drawing board with this drive. I should have done my research better - the random formatting into RAW and disconnecting/reconnecting seems to be a relatively common issue with this drive.Western Digital's warranty policy isn't exactly the friendliest either; with hard drive prices the way they are, they should be doing everything to keep their customers happy (offering to reimburse for RMA shipping, no questions asked policy, etc.)",5,6

This was my first 1TB model and I had high expectations.  I have multiple computers for work and home - 3 laptops and 1 desktop, 4 different operating systems.  It turned out that this device was only recognized by the desktop and 2 of my laptops.  In addition, on 1 of the 2 laptops that did recognize the device, the drive would magically disappear in the middle of a file transfer - this did not occur every time, but did happen a few times when I transfer larger files.  I ended up returning this 1TB model and went back to smaller sizes.  One other thing I don't like about My Passport products in general is that there's no case that comes with the product.

With all due respect to other raters, but please comment appropriately.  First the cable is not proprietary, it's USB 3.0 which is completely different then USB 2.0.  Although the end that plugs into the computer is designed to be backwards compatible there are actual 5 extra pins for USB 3.0, check out the specs before making ignorant claims.  This is why the cable is different where it plugs into the drive.  Secondly ""thetechguy1"" gave 2 eggs only because he couldn't get software to do what he wanted.  This reflect nothing on what the drive is or how it works.  Cloning can be a pain, if that's your goal there are better free software out there aside from acronis true image (which I use as well, and like, but it does have some limitations), like dd and Clonezilla.  They work great even on windows systems and there no limitation between cloning to/from SATA or USB."," When I have two of these on a desktop both plugged into 3.0 ports I get 90-120 MB/s data transfer, which is great, much better then USB 2.0 which I typically get 20-30 MB/s.

Software to automate backup process.," Software from Western Digital advertised as being able to clone a hard drive to a USB connected drive such as this My Passport unit is wrought with issues.  Booting from USB has many issues so even a good image may not boot and Western Digital Tier 2 tech support tells me that the image may not be perfect when cloning to USB anyway.  In a nuthshell, in order to use the Western Digital Acronis cloning software for a My Passport drive you need to connect it to the laptop with a device like a Sabrent USB-DSC5 USB to SATA adapter in order to get a configuration that ""should"" work (but still isn't guaranteed).  In the end therefore the Western Digital My Passport has no value add over any other maker's drive of that capacity which is a shame."," The Western Digital support website entries for Acronis software actually show it being used to close an internal hard drive to a USB connected drive even though booting from a USB drive is wrought with issues and they don't actually ""support"" or ""guarantee"" that process will work.  The manual shows the same examples as the website.  Very misleading, I had read the Acronis manual before I purchased this USB drive and was very disappointed when things went south in a hurry.",3,6

I used an encryption program for additional security, but that's not enough to warrant a decrease in rating.

Here is a shortlist of some great features:-Small: before buying this I read the review and most people were commenting positively about the size but I didn't think much of it. When it finally arrived, I was blow away, and am still awe-struck at how they are managing to build a such a darn small device with such a large capacity. This can easily go inside your pocket.-Size&Cost: Normally I'm a stickler for price but I believe for the physical size, form factor, and drive space you are getting every bang for your buck-Apps: The drive comes with a 3 great programs, a security, backup, and maintenance software. All do their jobs great, maintenance especially offers some excellent features like scanning for bad sectors or predicting failures-Cable Fitting: This is the one thing I was really scared about while I was waiting for this to arrive. I already own a seagate 1TB 2.5"" HD, and the port input is the same as this WD's but the seagate port is very loose. The cable plugs it but just a flick could pop it loose. But this WD's port is fantastic, plugging the cable into the back of the drive, you can hear the soft click and it's tightly fitted in. Very sturdy build."," -Folders: This is just a personal gripe but when I opened the drive there were about 4 or 5 folders with some setup content or something. I personally hate seeing something like that, if it were just a instruction manual with a setup exe it'll be somewhat okay with but opening it and seeing some clutter really annoys me. Not a big deal, I just installed the software and moved files and folders away-Cable size: maybe they did this on purpose for a special reason but I really don't like the cable length. It's a too short but not really that big of a problem"," Overall I love the drive, very fantastic piece of engineering. Cost, size, features, look are all great!!",6,6
9SIA0SX1P25133,22-236-187,11/3/2012 9:30:54 AM,Christopher R.,"One of the very few 2.5"" portable USB 3.0 drives in a 2TB capacity",4," The WD My Passport 2TB USB 3.0 is mostly fantastic. Cramming 2,000 GB of storage into a portable package isn’t easy, but if you’re Western Digital, you have the luxury of just making a special custom drive. In the case of the 2TB model, the WD HDD inside is a custom 2.5” 5200 RPM affair measuring over 14mm thick. To keep the size and bulk down, the USB controller is mounted on the drive’s PCB and there is no SATA power connector.Performance is quite competitive for a USB 3 portable drive system, with maximum sequential transfers reaching 115MB/s on the outer tracks. It’s about as quiet as most traditional 5400 RPM units, and happily doesn’t get very warm during operation. SMART utilities see the drive listed as WDC WD20NMVW (8MB cache, 5200 RPM, SATA II/3gbps, 01.01A01 firmware).I find WD’s included software is generally better overall than similar products’ suites, but maybe not by much. I like the fact that WD provides drive encryption software (please, don’t lose your password!), and the backup software is simple enough to use. Using WD’s SmartWare to create a backup of 71.7GBs worth of non-system files from my OS drive took a just a few seconds less than 20 minutes, working out to a 61MB/s average. That figure included 3GB of emails, 32GB of music, 27GB of video, and about 10GB of other files and pictures. That's quite good considering the speed of the drive and the mixed filesize content. I suppose someone, somewhere, is going to disapprove of the fact that the only color you can get the 2TB My Passport in is black. I’m not that someone though, and I find it to be acceptable in terms of aesthetics and build quality."," Over the past year, more and more external drives are being purchased merely to rip out the HDD inside. That’s not possible in this case due to its custom nature (the non-standard connectors on the drive etc.), so don’t buy it with that purpose in mind. Most people won’t ever find this to be any sort of a problem, and it’s difficult to take apart anyway.If you’re really looking for something to complain about, take umbrage with the 2 year warranty - 3 years would have been more appropriate in my opinion given the premium pricing, but considering the industry-wide HDD warranty reductions, perhaps two years of coverage should be considered generous. In any event, it’s a mostly standard number for the big drive makers’ external HDDs, Western Digital included."," All in all, I’m beginning to prefer the 2TB My Passport to my other USB 3.0 externals, both portable and desktop flavors. The USB 3.0 desktop solutions I use are a good bit faster than the WD portable, but they use considerably more juice (meaning they can’t be powered just via USB3 alone) and are decidedly something less than silent. The WD is spacious enough, fast enough, and quiet enough for me to use instead of 3.5”-based externals, but still portable enough to toss in the ol’ laptop bag -- despite the 4 platter design, the whole thing weighs a mere 8 ounces.Its quickly become my new favorite external storage device, and there really isn't anything bad to say about it - I highly recommended it when you need 2TB in a portable USB 3.0 format. Then again, as few 2TB 2.5"" portables as there are, it basically wins by default.",10,12
9SIA0SX1P25133,22-236-187,11/3/2012 9:22:24 AM,Robert P.,"Little Drive, Big Capacity",4," In my own testing, this drive approaches 120 MB/s sequential read over USB 3.0 according to HDTach.  Not bad for a 5200 rpm notebook size hard drive.  Using USB 2.0, it maxed out at around 39 MB/s, so you definitely should use USB 3.0 if you have it available.  I love how small this drive is.  Compared to my old external drive, it’s quite petite.  The drive also comes with a 2-year warranty; while I've notice other brands only go with 1-year.It comes with both backup and security software for both Windows and OSX.  A nice touch I've never seen before with a portable hard drive was an automatic check for new firmware.  After installing the software and plugging in the drive, a prompt appeared that notified me that a firmware update was available.  Updating the firmware was a simple matter."," The bundled My Passport software is not the greatest.  On my setup the software would run a scan of my backed up folders every time I started my computer.  I have several TB of data in the hard drive I have the software monitoring and the scan would noticeable slow down my system for about 15 minutes as it scanned.  Additionally, you cannot select specific folders to monitor, only an entire drive.  You can however limit what files are backed up by selecting categories (i.e. Pictures, Documents, Videos, etc.).The USB cable is short.  This is fine for notebooks or desktops with front panel USB 3.0, but for desktop users with only rear USB 3.0 ports you will most likely want a longer cable.  The cable is a standard USB 3.0 Micro B male connector on one end and the standard USB A-Type on the other if you want to purchase a longer cable."," Windows reports 1.81 TB free space and it comes out of the box formatted NTFS with 1MB alignment.  If you are brave enough to open the enclosure, you will find that the hard drive does not have a standard SATA or power connector.  The USB 3.0 port is attached to the hard drive PCB.  Also, the drive is a nonstandard height for a 2.5” drive.  What this means is that you can’t take the drive out and use it in a notebook or console.",3,3

The drive shipped safely in retail packaging along with tech support and warranty information, inside a newegg box filled with packaging peanuts. It came with a usb 3.0 cable which is 19"" long and backwards compatible with usb 2.0. The drive is made out of a hard plastic and feels durable. it has a white LED light that indicates when the drive has power or is in use.  it flashes when it is in use, and it stays on when the drive has power. the LED is a bit bright, and will shine on a wall in a dark room. i did not need to install any drivers or software to use the drive, my windows7 found it immediately. I opened the drive and found that i have 1.81TB of storage space available on the drive. the drive did not come completely empty, it has 185mb of files on it. of these files are PDF user manuals in different languages, a ""my passport"" application for macintosh computers. and a few different applications, (WD drive utilities, WD security and WD smartware) these program installers are both 32 and 64 bit.I installed the WD Drive Utilities program and got the updated version. the program opens and detects the WD My Passport 2tb drive, and then gives  choices on what you would like to do,  the program has several things it can help you with, it can check the S.M.A.R.T. status of the drive, you can do a quick drive self test, and a complete scan of the drive for bad sectors. you also have the option to choose how many minutes of inactivity before the drive stops spinning and goes into sleep mode. the options are 10, 15, 30, 45, 90, and never. by default this value is set at 30 minutes. it gives you a option to delete all the data on the drive, and it makes it easy to  register your drive with Western Digital, all they ask is for a first, and last name.. and  a email address. after submitting my information it stated i should receive a email confirmation. and i did immediately. I installed the WD Smartware and got the updated version. I ran this program and it opens a window and quickly finds out the contents of your hard disk drives.. it tells you how much space you have in different categories, such as pictures, music, movies, documents, system files, and other. this program makes it very simple to backup and catigorise your files onto the My Passport Drive.The Security program allows you to create a password to prevent people from being able to access your data in the event that they get ahold of your drive.", The is only 3 things about this drive that i think could be improved upon.The drive performs a bit slower than other USB3.0 external drives i have used. The price seems a bit steep for only 2TB of data storage.And the Led light is brighter than it needs to be.," I decided to benchmark the drive with HD Tune Pro to see how quickly it can perform.USB3.0 Maximum read speed 88.1MB/sUSB3.0 Minimum read speed 29.3MB/sUSB2.0 Maximum read speed 31.1MB/sUSB2.0 Minimum read speed 29.5MB/sI did a file copy test to see how the drive would perform in a real word situation, I started copying 374GB of data from one of my internal drives onto this drive. after about 30 minutes the copy speed averaged out at about 43MB/sWhich is about 148GB per hour, or 2.5GB per minute.My data backup took more than 3 hours and the drives temperature did not exceed 41c..  Overall i would say this is a good drive.",10,10

9SIA0SX1P25133,22-236-187,10/29/2012 3:41:41 PM,Leonard A.,Good things come in small packages!,5," This drive stands out from the rest because it holds more data in less space than most all others.It is a great drive for portable or desktop use. It isn’t quite as fast as some of the larger, 3.5"" more power hungry drives, but in practice, you may not even notice the difference. So go ahead, use it to backup several desktops without fumbling with power plugs, then put it in your pocket or bag.It works as well as any portable drive on USB 2.0. But on USB 3.0 it flies at about two to three times faster, depending on what you are doing. This is only about 80% of the speed of a faster 3.5"" USB 3.0 portable drive, making it hard to tell which you are using, and enticing you to buy this one for its convenience.It is the coolest portable drive I have ever used, getting only barely warm after many hours of use. It is quiet and elegant, without any seriously bad features I can identify. On USB 3.0 the difference in performance between this and its heavier, wall-wart using larger cousins is less than you might assume. If size, convenience, and power consumption are important to you, this drive is well worth the extra cost above larger portable drives."," The included backup software, like many other ""free"" bundled programs is not anything wonderful. You could use it to replace the odd lost file, but if your main system does not boot, you can’t recover from your backup without having a working operating system to run the backup program. So you will probably want third party backup software that has a bootable recovery environment.The USB connector on the rear of this drive has little strain relief. Looking inside the unit reveals that the drive’s circuit board visually bends every time you connect and disconnect the cable. You can easily bend the board as well by flexing the cable in normal use.This may or may not affect long term dependability, but it made me think that the unit was defective out of the box because it felt all wrong. It did, however, not fail after many uses in my testing. If you stepped on the plug or cable, or applied too much torque to it, you could destroy the drive. So this is possibly a weak point, unless you are careful.The case for this unit is thicker than ordinary 2.5"" portable drives, but this was necessary to give the 2 TB capacity. It still feels small for its capacity."," I would not hesitate to pay more for a USB 3.0 based portable hard drive because hopefully most computers, including laptops and smaller devices, will eventually have USB 3.0 ports. USB 3.0 can double or triple the performance of an external drive.Even on old USB 2.0 this is still a huge capacity but very portable drive, on which you could backup most laptops and also store a quite sizable library of media. On USB 3.0 it would be basically like having another drive inside your laptop with no speed penalty.But this is not really a laptop drive. It is a WD20NMVW which is a thicker size found in Blade servers, and other commercial machines. However, it is a 5400 RPM unit so it performs about the same as a laptop drive, but has double the capacity of the largest of these. It is a specialty drive made for this unit to do just what it does: be large capacity and consume little power.As convenient and fast as this port-powered unit is on USB 3.0, unless you actually need the greater capacity and performance of bulkier portable drives, you might still want this unit. Even for desktop use, its ease in transport may be just what you need. For laptop use, you can’t beat it!",3,3

It is 1.81 TB fully formatted if you clear off the WD software.  I like how it doesn't come preinstalled with Bloatware anymore, Like my 750GB passports I'm still a little concerned about the mobility of the drive due to the seemingly loose connection at the back of the drive. It moves more than I would like....My 750gb drives won't even work anymore unless i put downward pressure on the top of the connector. In essense I have to hang it off the side of my PC while holding it down by the connector for it to be recognized and to operate. I hope that this drive doesn't have the same thing happen.

All of a sudden this last week or so, it decided to throw off the training wheels. For whatever reason it only works reliably when I use the Data cable. For whatever reason,  if I use the power cable, it will freeze up the computer."," I bought this because it was cheap. I probably should have spent a bit more money, but hey, at least you don't have to make the same mistake. -Note I use this on a daily basis and do a lot of computer work of all kinds, so if you want a hard drive to sit on your desktop and move occasionally, while jumping ahead of the game and getting the new thing... this is probably for you. If not  spend your money elsewhere.Other weird thing about this drive, and its probably because of the USB3, but most computers treat it like a SATA drive. The unfortunate part about that is that you can't eject it, so I dont know if the cache has definitely written everything to it before yanking it out. Cheers",None,None

It comes with a nice soft cloth sleeve. It is silent. The price is good.," This device requires TWO open USB ports, one for power and one for data transfer.

You need to understand that ALL harddrives, internal/external/etc, are this way.  A drive that claims 500GB means it has 500 billion bytes.  They all take the term giga-byte to mean 1 billion bytes.  Windows (and maybe other OSs too) just happens to calculate a giga-byte in a different way.  Windows says 1 giga-byte is 1024*1024*1024.  That is, 1 KB in Windows doesn't equal 1,000 bytes, it equals 1,024 bytes.  So 1 MB isn't 1 million bytes it is 1024*1024, etc and so on.  500 billion bytes = 465.66 GB in the Windows world, so I'm sure your drive is in fact 500 billion bytes.

This external hard drive uses a ""proprietary"" USB 3.0 cable that powers and transfers data on this drive. You cannot plug just a standard USB 3.0 cable and expect it to work. One side needs to be plugged in for the data connection and the other for the power. The good news is that these A connectors usually form a snug fit. You can find replacements of these, but almost none transfer truly at 3.0 speeds. The current market is just not demanding enough.The Casing of the hard drive is very nice and solid. It actually does live up to the advertising potential. You can even watch videos to see how well it's made.The form factor is about your average laptop hard drive size. Add an inch on every side. The drive fits nicely in laptop bags, but expands slightly outward. Would not recommend carrying it in your pocket or purse.Transfer speeds are on par with USB 3.0. Not the fastest external, but noticeable enough. The overall speeds will mostly depend on what you're transferring and backing up."," There is nothing more aggravating than seeing Neweggers post reviews for products they do not even own. It is even worse seeing them spread misinformation to make up for their lack of tech knowledge and insecurities. First off, your standard USB 3.0 cables are no where ""thicker"" than your USB 2.0. They are actually about the same size. This cable is thicker because it has to transfer both data and power, and also uses an 'A' connector too. They make them thick to prevent any bends or crimps in the original cable. Purchase any USB 3.0 peripheral and you'll find the cable is about the same on par of your 2.0 (the end-connectors are slightly larger). You can order a replacement cable, but it will not be an exact copy. It will be a Y-cable instead. Y-cables are much more convenient and tend to be longer, but have yet to reach exact 3.0 speeds. So be informed at what you are buying ahead of time.The speeds are greater than 2.0, but not the faster 2.0. G definitely took some shortcuts with the hard drive speeds.500 GB is sufficient enough for general backups, and absolutely perfect for Timemachine. Don't use this drive to constantly play movies off of because you'll burn it up in no time."," It is a good drive at the end of the day and sufficient for most uses.

Ken, THAT IS a standard USB 3.0 connector. USB 3 cables ARE way thicker than USB 2.0 cables.

The erase/wiping feature seems to work just fine. Saved the day when Acronis True Image failed (""Clone Disk Operation Failed"") in the middle of cloning a disk with bad sectors. Sure, other tools might've worked, but few are as fast and simple as this device."," Cannot clone to smaller capacity drive, regardless of how much space is actually used. Doesn't always work as it should (see below)."," Daniel M.'s review states that ""the device has a rezise copy in which you can easily go from a larger drive to a smaller one as long as the data on the source disk will fit on the target"" but that is incorrect. From the manual: ""RESIZE mode is used to duplicate from a smaller Source drive to larger capacity Target drives. The Resize mode first runs a BRIEF copy and then expands the resulting partition on the Target drives so that the resulting partition uses all unallocated space. Resize copy supports the following file systems: FAT, FAT 32, NTFS. If the Source is not formatted as a supported file system then the duplicator will automatically switch to FULL mode.""Testing:1. Cloning a Western Digital 160GB WD1600AAJS to another 160GB WD1600AAJS: target too small error in both Brief and Full modes. Ended up connecting the drives to a computer and using dd (which worked just fine).2. Cloning a Samsung 160 HD161GJ to a Seagate 160GB ST3160812AS in Brief mode: OK.3. Cloning a 160GB drive (with only a few GBs of data) to an 80GB drive in Brief mode: target too small error. (The advertising material and manual says cloning to larger drives is supported, but makes no mention of cloning to smaller drives, so I had to test to find out.)4. Cloning a 160GB drive to a 250GB drive in Brief mode: OK.If Kanguru fixes whatever caused the failure in #1 above, and added support for #3 via firmware update, this would be a must-have device for mobile technicians.

This hard-drive was drop tested on 26 contact points (8 corners, 12 cut surfaces and 6 major surfaces). This is great I will get a lot of use out of it.

9SIA0AJ2RP9490,22-301-001,4/21/2014 3:50:38 AM,GIFT R.,"A very well designed hard drive, able to stand the elements. Tested well in benchmark.",5," + A military grade external hard drive designed to withstand the toughest elements: Water, shock, heat, cold, and drops. My drive withstood two drops and water over the USB port and still performed well.+ Benchmarked at very fast speeds compared to my eSata USB 3.0 drives. (116 MB/s Read, 115 MB/s Write)+ A very smart design, with the ability to carry a very small cord that should never be lost.+ A three year warranty to back up the claim of the military grade product.", None," ▶ AccessoriesThe two accessories included are two included USB 3.0 mode cables (USB male to USB male); one short 4.25 inch cable and one long 30 inch cable. The USB interface is a newer standard for external hard drives, as it is able to achieve speeds as high as 625 MBps (In theory and compared to 300 MBps with eSata, the old standard), but in reality will benchmark close in real world tests. I really like that the interface isn’t proprietary and is easily replaceable.▶ HardwareDue to the nature of this device, it a little larger and heavier than most of the external hard drives that I own(5.5 x 3.7 x 0.7 inches; 9.6 ounces vs WD Elements: 4.4 x 3.2 x 0.6 inches; 8.6 ounces vs Brinell 1TB: 4.5 x 3.4 x 0.5 inches; 6.7 ounces). This device comes in one color, a matt blue aluminum, which is supposedly also “Military Grade”. This means that this product should withstand drops, temperature changes, water, and shock without damaging the device. If the device ever does get damaged, it does come with a 3 year warranty. On the front body is the Silicon Power name and logo, and on the back is the capacity followed by certifications. On the left side is the USB port and a flap over it to avoid being damaged from water. On the right side is a compartment for the short USB cable, which is a great place when you need a cord on the go, but would be very annoying due to its 4.25 inch length. Overall, the device is designed well, and created for tough situations.▶ SoftwareThe name of the drive that arrived is named “SP PHD U3” with 931GB of usable storage in the FAT32 default format. The external hard drive includes a very easy method to register your product:1.	Click the program “Activate Warranty.exe”2.	Enter your name and email3.	Congrats, you registered your product.No mailing registration cards or frustration. Silicon Power created a fast and simple method for registering products.▶ TestingI started testing the “Military Grade” remark by dropping my device from my desk height of 30.75 inches, and then running water over the USB port. The drive maintained stability before and after the tests. I then benchmarked the product through CrystalDiskMark.Sequential Read: 116.859 MB/sSequential Write: 115.839This device is the fastest of my three USB 3.0 1TB external hard drives (WD Elements: 80MB/s Read and Write, Brinell: 116 MB/s Read, 94.15 MB/s Write). This was probably due to the USB 3.0 to USB 3.0 connection, instead of eSata to USB 3.0. I am more than satisfied by these results.▶ Final ThoughtsDespite being a little heavier and bigger than my other USB 3.0 External hard drives, it is durable and performed much faster than my other drives. I don’t mind the extra weight and size if it performs well. Because of this, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an external hard drive, and is why I give this product a 5 egg rating.",2,2

If you were looking for an external drive as a gift, this is a great option.Drive comes formatted, labeled, and has a warranty registration app built in for ease of use.Transfer speeds are pretty standard on USB 3.0, but are remarkably stable on large single files (averaging over 90 MB/s sustained transfer rate)."," Neither of these cons are exclusive to this brand or model, so I'm not removing any stars for them:1. A 1-year limited warranty is pathetic for any hard drive, and is even less inspiring in an external drive. You can't help but wonder if the enclosure is further limiting their life span, and if so, why no one has bothered to come up with a better way? Would air holes allow them to breathe better? Would keeping them right side up help more? Providing this information couldn't hurt.2. The size and price of this drive and drives like this have been stagnant for far too long. This very brand sells a similar external drive that is THREE TIMES LARGER for about $5-10 more. They sell a similar model with double the capacity for the exact same price. I understand the idea of minimum price requirements (i.e. the case costs the same amount, regardless of space), but if that's the case, why are you still selling drives this size? This isn't so much a complaint of the manufacturer, but all manufacturers. It's time for rotating drives to move beyond 500GB as the minimum, and certainly beyond 250 and 320."," Seagate's gotten a bad wrap recently about the lifespan of their drives, specifically as a result of Backblaze's very interesting studies. It's worth noting that these results came from very specific drives that used different platters and drives than what are used in 2.5"" drives.It's also worth noting that the newest Seagate 4+TB drives have no such issues, so whatever problems they've previously had seem to have been worked through. Evidence would suggest that pretty much all drives produced today have a similar level of quality and lifespan. The only difference these days seem to be largely delegated to capacity, price and Aesthetics.",None,None

One picture on page 1 with two steps.  Step one - plug the USB cable into the drive.  Step two - plug the cable into your computer.  Done.- Why did Seagate feel the need to include the warranty info in a PDF and a registration app. pre-installed on the hard drive?  I guess it’s better to receive that kind of stuff rather than bloatware.  Still feel free to delete that stuff though.- The drive comes pre-formatted as an NTFS drive, just an FYI.- I tried looking around for an LED indicator before plugging the hard drive in and for the life of me, I couldn’t find one.  BUT, once plugged in, there is a bright blue “slash” of an LED indicator light that illuminates in one of the corners.- Comes in a small cardboard box.

This thing is very slow in comparison to today's technology. Spinning up to wait for transfer to start is the wort part of how slow it is. This is through the 3.0 USB on a very fast computer. The transfer rate is ok once it gets going. I have to think the slow spin is not related to the USB port since it does the same on both 2.0 and 3.0 ......... The transfer rate is nothing to write home about but ok once the drive is moving. I will stick to Western Digital in the future. I don't feel very good about putting anything important on this drive. It just feels untrustworthy  when dragging & dropping on the fly., I have several external hard drives and 2 of them are old technology but they are faster than this thing running on 2.0 USB. This mostly in reaction time and not transfer rate but its not a whole lot faster there. I mostly own Western Digital & have never had any problems with them. The 3.0 WD I purchased recently puts this one to shame. I purchased the Toshiba to transfer my files on the older ones and since all the little weird spin up & down issues I moved the files back. I don't trust this one. I plan to go to the sight and see if there are any updates for it. I am hopeful there is!

I really like the cables because they support both standards of small device USB cables but the included cable is very rigid and sturdy and it gives these drives a much more ""safe"" feeling knowing there's a little more teeth holding on to the drive, especially since I use it most with my collection of 8 and 10"" tablets via powered OTG.

Great storage drive, and compact enough to use as a quick transfer/boot drive if you really need to."," The 5 stars are earned.  I've never had a Toshiba drive die or degrade on me.

He even said he was using it on an iMac.  Seriously?  Why on earth would you want a ""long"" cable for such a small drive?  A cable that was much longer than the one included would freak me out.  It would be too easy to accidentally stand up and yank it or trip over it.

This is similar to my old externals, just a bit thicker and green."," On a technical level, this drive is very good.However, it is an ugly shade of green that would have been appropriate 14 years ago for the Original Xbox, today the tacky green is just out of place. The current XBOne is primarily available in black, and the XBOne-S will be white, this doesn't match either machine and is kind of an eyesore next to my machine.It would be nice if it was a bit easier to hide, but the USB 3.0 cable is pretty short, which makes hiding it if your using the side USB port a bit of a pain."," The ugly color and short cable are minor issues considering how much storage and quick this external hard drive is.  Would be nice if Seagate differentiated this drive more from their standard PC external drives, outside of the Xbox logo on the top. Maybe removable plates for the top and bottom so we can change the color of the drive to best match the owners XBox would be a nice addition.As it stands, it's a solid drive that performs well, but a standard Desktop USB 3.0 4TB drive would do the same thing, and they tend to cost less and have a less polarizing color.",0,4

NFTS formatted capacity is 3.63 TB.•	I connected this hard drive to my Windows 10 Pro PC. The drive is completely bare. There is no software installed on this drive. The drive is NFTS formatted out of the box.•	I transferred about  2.13 TB of data from my NAS to the drive (over gigabit LAN and through USB 3.0 port on my PC).  I also transferred  some data from SSD drive on my PC. In both cases the transfer speed hovered about 108 Mb/s.  Not bad for mechanical drive.•	Standard 18 inch USB 3.0 cable is included.•	Very visible “Designed for XBOX” branding. •	Branding matches my Xbox One. •	The easiest and least expensive way to add capacity to Xbox. •	No power cable needed, the drive receives all the power it needs through its USB 3.0 connection.•	Once connected to an Xbox, the drive gets recognized and formatted very quickly by the console.•	Xbox one games will install and load slightly faster from this external USB 3.0 drive."," •	The product box indicates 1 Year warranty for the US. When I went to Seagate website and tried to register this drive for warranty purposes I received the following message that the drive is out of warranty. I contacted Seagate via email and I was told that this was not “saleable unit” and to contact “your point of sale”. Apparently, since my drive is a review unit, it does not have warranty. Always make sure to register your drive with Seagate and keep your receipt. •	Price premium and lack of 200 GB cloud storage that comes standard with similar Seagate Backup Plus Slim drives.•	No information is available on what specific advantage this XBOX-branded drive holds over Seagate Backup Plus drives. Seems like this product was intended for sale as Microsoft product rather than Seagate’s."," •	I have an Xbox One with 500 GB of internal memory. Xbox One can simultaneously use two external drives such as this 4 TB Game Drive for Xbox. Prior to attaching this 4 GB Game Drive to my XBOX, I already had 2 TB Game Drive version working with my XBOX. Both drives work seamlessly and both drives are simultaneously recognized by my XBOX One. I now have a total of 6 TB of external storage.  Each drive appears by itself on XBOX.  Since a single game can take up close 50 GB of storage, it’s easy to fill up Xbox’s One drive fairly quickly.  External hard drives, such as this Game Drive for Xbox is the quickest, the easiest and the least expensive way to add large amount of storage to your Xbox. Once I connected the external drive to my Xbox, the Xbox formatted the drive and asked me if I want to install new games and other content by default to this external drive. I said yes and that was it for the setup.  Now I have almost 4 TB of additional Xbox storage. •	Unfortunately, it now appears that Microsoft shelved plans to rollout OTA DVR functionality in Xbox One. However, getting large external hard drive for your Xbox One still makes a lot of sense. 4 TB Game Drive for Xbox will not disappoint you and it will satisfy your console’s storage needs for a long time.",None,None

The games seem to load a noticeable amount faster than with the Stock Internal HDD but we are not talking about night and day. maybe 20% faster at best. This is because the HDD used inside this enclosure is not very fast. After discovering this I tried to find out the actual specs from Seagate's site, but all thats listed there is generic ""info"". Nothing as far as spindle speed, cache, etc.Taking the drive apart I found the following Model inside: ST4000LM016-1N2170. A bit of Googling found it to be a 5400RPM HDD with 128MB Cache (oddly only 16MB Cache was detected by Defragler?)Running Crystal mark gave the following results with an empty drive:SEQ - Read 140.9MB/s --- Write 139.2MB/s512K - Read 44.72MB/s --- Write 90.70MB/s4K  - Read 0.365MB/s --- Write 5.952MB/s4K QD32 - Read 0.445MB/s --- Write 6.643MB/sAfter adding 1.28TB of Data the results changed a bit:SEQ - Read 118.3MB/s --- Write 116.2MB/s512K - Read 38.16MB/s --- Write 96.64MB/s4K  - Read 0.308MB/s --- Write 5.986MB/s4K QD32 - Read 0.376MB/s --- Write 6.753MB/sFor what its worth the Data transfer of 1.28TB took over 6 hours.I can say this drive does exactly What is advertised, but it does so at a higher price and I cant really say that there is a valid reason for that other than branded XBOX logo on top. Other Seagate 4TB external HDDs Start around $110, Im guessing most of them will have the same HDD inside the enclosure. So take that for what you will. If you want a speedy drive look elsewhere.

Indicator light isn't overly bright.  Drive operation is almost completely silent."," It's the slowest USB 3.0 external drive I own (I have 4 of them).  Transfers through USB 3 average 35-40 MB/s, which is only just a bit faster than USB 2 through this drive (33 MB/s)."," This seems like a niche' product to me, as the 500GB version isn't too much more (and is actually cheaper than this drive as of this review) and will likely (hopefully) have a bit more throughput.  It feels well made, but I haven't dropped it a few times to really test that out.  The bundled software is actually quite useful for backing up photos, documents, etc and the tools for wiping the drive also are handy and both work quite well.  The drive did get a bit warm about 30 minutes in during a 250GB copy to fill the drive but it never got to the point of what I would call hot.  This drive also seems to have a bit more of a vibration than other external drives I own (I have another about this size).  The 250GB transfer I did was a mixture of zips, photos, mp3's, and word & excel docs.  Took 2 hours to complete (35 MB/s).   I then ran 4-5GB of each type of file (zip, photo, mp3, etc) but throughput never exceeded 42 MB/s write speed via usb 3.  I am thinking this is a single platter 5400rpm drive in this enclosure based on the speeds I am getting.  If you don't need a bunch of external storage, or need faster usb 3.0 speeds (70+ MB/s) and this little drive happens to be the lowest cost option available then it would be a solid choice.

I had a problem setting this drive up on one laptop as I was missing a vital SES device driver, this was easily located (in one of the included folders on the drive) and installed manually (no eggs removed).

Software includes utilities, security and backup and looks for updates automatically when opened. Utilities contains self-diagnostics, sleep timer and drive erase. Security allows you to set up a virtual drive and set password and the Smartware backup software can automatically choose the files for backup including a full system copy, photos, music, movies, email and documents.

However, I do not have air-conditioning, and this was during very hot days during which I stress-tested the drive with very large transfers of directories that included nested sub-directories of four levels or more. It's _only_ for this reason that I accord a 4 out of 5 rating."," IMVHO, the heat problem was just during the ""breaking-in"" period of the new drive. After those first few days, this no longer occurs. One may choose to re-partition the drive. I have such confidence in this product, that I chose to keep a single partition. Having purchased this and other manufacturers' products in the past, I am convinced of the high quality and reliablity of Seagate products.As such, I endorse this product as an item which one can buy with full confidence.",9,11

Perfectly fits my needs.," Because it uses a 2.5"" drive, you aren't going to get the kind of speeds you will see on the 3.5"" desktop drives.", An excellent option if you need to store your files somewhere away from your main computer.I get about 45 MB/sec copy speed when copying files to the drive which is faster than USB 2.0 speeds.,None,None
