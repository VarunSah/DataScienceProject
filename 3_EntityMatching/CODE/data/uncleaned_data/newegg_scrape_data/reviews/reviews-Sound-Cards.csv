It fits nicely on my desk (connected to my monitor's USB), and easy to carry in my laptop bag.  It works well enough with meeting software (Skype, GotoMeeting,...).The high resolution audio is nice as I do have several high definition audio files.  It plays them just fine.  Still, there is a small amount of hum that this ""sound card"" generates that degrades that particular feature.It is easy to use -- just plug it in, let the drivers sync, and away you go (Windows 8.1).I didn't play with the SPDIF much, but it did appear to at least work.I do have to say that I really appreciate the little LED indicators.  They are very visible, and it's very cool that the output LED will flash red for the right channel and blue for the left.  This leads to a rather nice varying purple for most sources.  Still, it is pretty cool."," * Some background noise* Microphone support and Mute is inconsistent* Placement of microphone jackThe background noise is a slight ding.  That said, I have found it depends on the device it is plugged into as it can vary.  It may be more a matter of the USB power source noise.  If that's the case, this could benefit from some power regulation and cleanup.My biggest complaint, though, is in regards to the microphone support.  I have an analog headset with microphone, and I have often had the microphone just start to fade out until nobody can hear me on the other end.  It's not the headset, as it works fine with everything else.  Quickly unplugging and plugging it back into the USB port fixes this.  It is annoying, though, as there is no way to know if folks can really hear you or not on the other end.A minor issue I also have is the placement of the microphone jack on the bottom rather than with the output jack."," I really like this little unit.

From 500Hz down to 450Hz there is a quick drop -6dB in volume that persists all the way down to minimum audible frequencies. Same thing happens from 4000Hz to 4050Hz and stays -6dB going up from there. Tweaking the EQ can mitigate this but still leaves some annoying peaks and valleys around those frequencies. Since we're dealing with the same audio chipset for the entire STRIX line of audio cards; I have little doubt this is persistent across the entire series IF my unit isn't defective.Software installation is as much a hassle as always with ASUS. It's drivers are not signed for Win7/64-bit, have failed to install correctly ~33% of all attempts thus far, begin showing signs of deterioration and audio issues within a day, and many of the functions do not change anything at all. ASUS tend to make decent hardware with some design caveats and oversights on occasion. But their achilles heel is always in software development. Eventually after a few years it matures, but most get it done better in the outset and fix it far faster. Even now UNi Xonar custom drivers are still superior for their older Xonar line than their existing software. Making my Xonar DG superior to this. Yes, this is a direct metaphorical slap-in-the-face for ASUS.The inclusion of the 6-pin PCIe power input is actually a placebo. Don't get me wrong; it MUST be connected for the card to function. However I have tried the High Impedance modes for both this STRIX card and the Xonar DG. Since the DG is powered only off the legacy PCI (max 25 watts) you would think the 75 watts provided by the PCIe slot itself is enough; NOPE! Seriously?! Why? I suppose maybe it's not using the PCIe power, but that's counter-intuitive since it's easy and inexpensive to filter, and then it's fully dependent on the PSU's EMI noise and ripple if left unfiltered. What's worse is the high impedance mode of both cards are near identical in volume on my Sennheiser headphones. This had better be a defective unit; or ASUS needs to do a full recall and re-engineer the STRIX line. This is unacceptable for even on-board audio."," I'm honestly glad ASUS has shaken up and quickly dominated the PC monitor market. My ASUS 26"" 1920x1200 monitor from 2008 lasted 18 months before display corruption, spent two weeks sitting at their repair center after repairs were complete, and lived another 3 years after until the same display corruption returned. While my current QNIX 27"" 1440p has had no such issues since replacing it. Spectacular. Well done ASUS, well done... Considering every single ASUS product I've ever owned with exception to the Xonar has been faulty or died outright on me, I really need to stop buying them. But as much disappointment as I have for ASUS, I am still willing and able to be fairly critical with segregated objectivity and subjectivity in the above review in spite of that negative bias. I recommend holding off buying the STRIX audio cards until more reviews come out. I may have a defective card.",3,7

In fact, multiple surround speakers may reduce sample rate, THD (Total Harmonic Distortion), Stereo Crosstalk, SnR, etc., and therefore, surround sound system may reduce audio quality experience than stereo mode. -From my personal experience, I personally picked FPS profile to get louder bass, and better audio mix for guns, footsteps, character dialogue, music, etc. But nonetheless, there are lots of great profiles to choose to best soothe your human ears. For sound driver, I am currently using 1.1.12 and I believe ASUS software developer still needs a lot of work to get the driver working correctly and also needs to improve firmware update since sometimes control box wasn't detected with high-speed NVMe drive when booting to Windows.

I once owned a Creative Titanium HD that I ""upgraded"" to the Creative ZxR because (at the time) I was disappointed with the lack of official Windows 8.1 support.After downgrading my mATX PC to an iTX one, I decided to go the route of Schiit DAC / AMP. I found this solution was simply not for me. I did not like how it sounded, did not like the lack of options and did not like how everything looked outside of my case.I was about to give up and start using on-board when discovered that the Europeans have been enjoying this little gem for months! Apparently ASUS fixed the issues with the previous STX and brought it inline with that of the ST (PCI version) while making a few more improvements."," This thing comes advertised with EAX (1,2 & 5). The EAX support is... emulated and by no means hardware accelerated. Furthermore ""GX"" mode (EAX) does not work - or at least I can not tell the difference. I have tried BIOSHOCK, Diablo 2 and Carmageddon. Nothing seems to work. This is not so much a con, but a con none the less if you were looking to play older titles with a full audio immersion.I should also point out that this version is for the sound card only. It does not come with the 7.1 add-on daughter card."," If you are in the market for a truly remarkable, consumer grade, sound card then look no further than the STX II. The sound quality is far better than Creative's ZxR and Titanium HD and even manages to edge out the older Essence ST.",6,7

With decent headphones the X7 provides true stereo separation between channels, and is truly pleasurable for music playback. As a gaming interface, the audio enhancements work well, and the device can be toggled from direct to affected modes easily. Some games benefit from Creative's virtual surround mode more than others, but all in all the audio fidelity and channel separation are so good that, with headphones at least, the device-as-DAC is great."," As with most Creative products, the drivers tend to be somewhat sensitive to random cosmic events. Some days the X7 will operate flawlessly, while on others the device will refuse to switch between speaker and headphone mode because the X7 control panel will refuse to, for whatever reason."," I do not have the X7 hooked up to speakers, so I cannot comment on that aspect of the unit.",5,7

I have been using a Sound Blaster ZXR for over a year and was thinking of upgrading to an Asus Sonic card but I wanted to hold off for the X7 that was about to be released from Creative Labs. WOW I am so glad I did. This box rocks and puts my ZXR to shame. The sharpness from the high definition sound will blow you away. Super easy hook ups and the new control panel software has all the other things the ZXR sound panel was always missing. Looks super cool on my desk and freed up one of my PCI slots. The Bluetooth is amazing and sounds so good. Just like candy to the ear. Using AT M50 headset at the 600 ohms amp setting on the control panel and it possibly the best sound I have ever heard from a computer. You will think you are in a live concert. I have to give this box a 5 star plus. A huge pat on the back to Creative Labs and their tech's and the Sound Blaster group. You guy's and girl's have a huge winner in the sound card category. Nothing even compares to this box. I have tried them all A huge thank you to Newegg. I have always said they are the best in the business. Buy all my things through them. If you are on the edge this is a no brainer. Get it not before they are sold out. When the word gets out and all the reviews are read they will be hard to get. I compared it to my DENON AVR-X5200W that I paid about 2,000.00 with 5.1 M&K Speaker system and I swear I could not tell a difference. Now the X7 is hooked up to the X5200W and man what a sound.

This was especially evident to me who is someone who has always had a sound card. Well after this experience I knew I was getting another sound card, now which one. I wasn't going to go down or stay the same with what I previously had so the Blaster Z was pretty much the choice for me.

The U5 has boost, equalizer, that has better quality than the Sound Blaster Z pcie. The different modes(audio config) do work well. Not sure if I'll use live, cave, enhancements much, the studio sounds best for my needs. Playing BF or GTA 5, the sounds are clear and bass where you want it.The best feature is being able to switch from headset to speakers with pushing the button in game, where doing this with before would usually cancel any sound in game.Also gives my Logitech 2.1 speakers a great boost and sound clarity. Had no difficulty with downloading, installing the driver."," The only problem was it says ""Advanced Plug Ins"" in a window on the software screen. No where in the manual or videos is it ever mentioned. I contacted Asus Help, they said it is when you plug in an external device it will show up there."," The Sound Blaster Z SBX PCIE is about the same price, for my set up it was just that, blasting sound even with tweaking the equalizer.

Normally it's general knowledge that Asus makes decent and reliable stuff. I did read several reviews and all were quite positive about the soundcard.So I was looking for a replacement and my birthday was coming up (mid-May) and I decided to ask the soundcard for a gift (couldn't think of anything else). But wow. What a disappointment this is/was. Worst ""gift"" you can get... ever.At first everything worked great, however I didn't have much time to test it, because of very busy days. Past week I started to use my computer a bit more and do some more work. In the meantime I was listening to a radio stream. Suddenly I started to notice random loops, followed by no sound at all anymore. It looks like the soundcard itself is hanging or whatever.The only solution is to reboot my computer. Which isn't very nice when you have several windows open with your work. Oh well. So after a reboot and a few minutes working again, the same or similar issue; sound loops. Sigh. This time I kept working and turned on our old-skool radio (remember this is 2016).So I decided to send Asus support an email about this issue and got a response back the next day. Well let's say, what they answered is a good reason for me to ditch the Asus brand completely and for always. Man, I never experienced this kind of *beep* support before. I thought Asus was a reliable company, however the opposite seems true. In the meantime I also read various other issues with these soundcards (also the more expensive versions). As it seems to me, there is a hardware fault in this product.Because of this (very) bad experience with this Asus product and Asus support I decided to ignore Asus products from now on completely. I will even sell my current line of Asus products, so I don't have to ""use"" their support (which is non-existence and lousy anyways). First I will sell off my X99-E WS motherboard. Along with other products I own from Asus (luckily not that many; thank you Lord).On a sidenote; I was planning to buy a laptop for my girlfriend and I *was* gearing to an Asus one, however after this experience... Well you guessed it; it won't be an Asus...Shame on you Asus for releasing such a faulted product and shame on you again for having such bad support!",3,21

That's gone- Software is excellent, and easy to use/learn."," -The Sound card itself is large, I had a 8/10 difficult time fitting it into my 8700 xps desktop. Then, again that desktop is small."," I had the most difficult time finding a sound card that work with my Razer Tiamat 7.1. A lot of audiophiles claim the 7.1 Tiamat is silly because of all the drivers inside the headset, therefore making true 7.1 sound terrible or something, I don't know. I personally love my Razer Tiamat 7.1 , Music sounds amazing, and I feel like i'm engulfed in whatever i'm doing  because of my headset. Anyways: This soundcard is compatible with the Tiamat 7.1, it's a little time consuming to insert the cords into all the right jacks so I will post a photograph of how I have my set up later to save you time if you have the same headset. After so much research on the Tiamat 7.1 and other sound cards, people always have an issue with it. Aside from the compatibility, sound is great! I cannot say I have any complaints other than the sound card being big.  I would definitely buy this again if it broke, or went faulty. I Recommend it 10 thumbs up.",6,9
9SIA24G4R66370,29-132-100,3/2/2016 9:18:19 PM,Ethan H.,Worked great until,3," Never used a sound card before. I've always used the motherboards sound or my keyboard sound(Logitech G510). I was impressed and still am impressed by the quality of sound coming out of this thing. I currently run it though some RPM3 monitors or my Tascam TH-300X headphones, sounds fantastic though both. The software is also pretty awesome and live up to Asus's simple to use software thats effective for me. Card looks cool but is a bit big. The PCB is coated in some kind of rubber compound which seems to give it durability. Has a fully adjustable EQ on it, I run it on the metal setting with the lows dialed down a bit, has a bit of flubby narrow low end."," Well, it worked great until one today when playing subnatica it decides to start making popping sounds and cracking sounds, but I still haven't ruled out the sound card for that one, cause it still plays music fantastically. I should also mention that it crashed Crysis 3 with audio cutting in and out until the game gave up on life. So, I did what any amp and guitar effects builder would do, the second I saw it had a replaceable OPA amp in a cradle, I changed it out to a OPA 2134. Didn't fix any of the game issues, but it did give the card much needed balls in the lower end. I should mention that the chip it came with was an outdated and no longer manufactured OPA 49720.The one thing that got me when I first got the card was the need for a 6 pin power source....I mean what on Earth does it need that for? It's a sound card, not a graphics card. I found it amusing as well, but I have a power supply that can handle just about anything so it didn't matter that much."," I've normally never had a problem with Asus products, this sound card was a bit of a disappointment for causing my gaming issues after about 2 weeks of use. And the use of outdated parts means that they only have a limited amount of these things with this chip. I wouldn't recommend buying this card, I know it's a decent price, but I should of just bought the more expensive one.",2,7
9SIA24G4R66370,29-132-100,2/29/2016 3:34:50 AM,Michael W.,Wrote a somewhat premature review on the 'other' Soar card.,1," Looks nice, feels well manufacturedI do like the wide variety of configurations available.All configurations are in a single well laid out page."," The single biggest issue I have with this card is the raw frequency response range. Leaving EQ alone and disabling Bass Boost (on by default) everything seems flat from 500Hz to 4kHz. However there is a huge -6dB drop just 50Hz above and below that mid-range that remains flat all the way out from there. This means lows and highs are absolutely dead, near silent by comparison to the mids. Turning Bass Boost on doe not solve this in full as it only amps things up to about 250Hz and tapers off from there. EQ cannot fix this since no matter how you rebalance it you WILL have some nasty ear-piercing peaks and near silent valleys around these 450Hz and 4050Hz frequencies, which are often used. It sounds horrible and unnatural. Even the Xonar DG does not do this and sounds BETTER because of it!Speaking of the Xonar DG... it uses Legacy PCI with no supplemental power. That's a maximum 25 watts. With its high-impedance amp enabled it is almost as loud as the STRIX which has access to BOTH 75 watts from the PCIe port and a 6-pin PCIe connector to the PSU. Six times the power available to the STRIX and it's only barely louder than the Xonar DG?! And before anyone claims it doesn't use the PCIe slot power - it does or there wouldn't be traces coming from the pins.Last but certainly not least is the software. It's failed to install correctly about 33% of all attempts in an effort to figure out what's wrong with this thing. The drivers are NOT signed and require authorization from an admin. Best to run the installer as an admin too, but that's not stopped it from installing incorrectly. On top of that, many of the functions in the GUI do nothing at all. Particularly functions involving the mic input. On-board Realtek 878 handles my mic better than this piece of junk! And we're not done with the software... oh no... Even if it installs correctly functionality will quickly start disappearing or doing nothing, and you will start to notice popping and humming in the audio. Eventually there will be a noticeable second of ""wake-up"" time as sound sorta fades back in or in the case of video is delayed outright before pausing the video to resync it with the delayed audio.All in all BOTH the software and hardware is broken by design and nothing about this soundcard is fit for purpose. If you are unlucky to have bought this card on the hope it being new meant it's better - it's not. The Xonar DG and likely every other Xonar card is better."," The reason I am re-reviewing this, and the reason for the title is because I got in touch with ASUS support. They claim the frequency response drop-off points are INTENTIONAL!!!I would give this a 0/5 if Newegg allowed!",5,11
9SIA24G4R66370,29-132-100,1/29/2016 5:58:28 PM,Jay L.,Great bang for your bucks,5," Industry-leading software interfaceIn my opinion the best sound quality for internal sound cards at this price rangeSlick appearanceWhile not mentioned, the PCB looks like ASUS Auto-Extreme manufacturing as the soldering is smooth and nearly flawless6-pin PCI-E power connector instead of molexESS Sabre DAC", More expensive than European price if you convert currencyOwl eye isn't really visible when installedLooks somewhat gimmicky," I'm a computer geek and love trying new gadgets, so when I saw the Strix Soar finally available on some jungle-themed shopping site I decided to take a leap into the unknown. I chose the cheapest variant of the three cards since I didn't want to risk wasting a large sum and not getting any results. If I lose, I wouldn't be losing too much.I am happy to report that this card has exceeded all my expectations, especially considering the fact that I'm coming from Essence STX II card with three Muses 01 Op Amps. For those of you unfamiliar with the jibberish I just mentioned, that's the top audiophile card from ASUS with Japanese Operation Amplifiers from New Japan Radio. Each little amplifier costs you a whopping $50 USD, on top of the $240+ sound card.So how does this $99 card fare against its upgraded $400+ cousin? It actually doesn't sound all that different and even manage to beat the Essence in some areas!The first thing that came to my mind was how beautiful and intuitive the software is. The interface presents you with all the available options in a single page. Everything is nicely laid out and customizing the card to your liking is a breeze. This contrasts very much with ASUS' older software featuring bland/stale looks and spartan feature sets. Creative also lose out as their software is full of fluff and useless options.I'm not going to discuss the gamer-oriented features as I don't play much FPS to make any use of them. While I haven't tested the positional performance in FPS titles, I can tell you that the stereo separation of the card is phenomenal from playing some MMOs and listening to music. You can clearly hear the direction/position the sound is coming from, whether it be environmental noise or another player's footsteps. For those of you wondering what speakers I'm using - I'm sporting a pair of JBL LSR 305 studio monitors.Now on to the most important thing: sound quality. I buy sound cards to listen to music primarily and will judge them based on this criteria most heavily. While I can't attest to the accuracy of the sound coming out of this card without a live source for comparison, I can say for sure that the sound quality won't disappoint.The sound card features a somewhat V shaped sound signature, with a bit more emphasis towards highs and lows. I think ASUS did a great job with this as the mids don't feel recessed at all. The sound signature is very lively and ""fun"" without getting tiresome. If you're upgrading from motherboard audio, you're going to hear details you've never heard before provided you have a decent set of speakers at your disposal.Compared to my Essence STX II, John Powell & Gavin Greenaway's ""Coming Back Around"" from How to Train Your Dragon sounded much more exciting and engaging, with slightly more artificial highs and fuller lows in comparison. While you do lose a small bit of detail and realism, the trade-off is in my opinion is well worth it given the price difference.Some of you might wonder if Soundblaster Z could do the same since it's in the same price range. I'm going to tell you no... This card curbstomps SBZ... SBZ hisses and sounds metallic at highs, it's booming and unnatural at lows, the ""crystallizer"" in my opinion should be named ""music/ear killer"". Just get this card instead and thank me later.Anyways, to sum things up - I am flabbergasted by the price/performance ratio of this sound card and feel a bit upset even as I write this message. While the Essence STX II sounded pretty freaking good and in some cases more natural compared to the Strix, at 1/4 the cost the Strix's got about 90% of the performance of the upgraded STX II while packing significantly more features. I'm not going to pull out the Muses Amps... I don't want to compare stock STX II to this card. I basically paid a 300% difference in price and received 10% back in performance... ASUS - if you guys are reading this - you're welcome to update the software on STX II... Give me something prettier to look at at least please?For those of you on a very tight budget - I would recommend you spend your money on better speakers first. That would affect your sound much more than any sound card would. After that, get this card. I don't think anything can touch it at its price range as of today.",4,7

I have a Sony MP3 NWZ-X1061. Its sound quality is the best, much better than Apple Ipod. But sometimes it is not loud enough, so I thought this Sound Blaster E1 would boost its sound at least half of what I have got from the Sony MP3, but I am wrong.

9SIA4RE4VX3594,29-102-047,8/31/2014 11:56:04 AM,Douglas S.,Buyer Beware,2," Take this for what it's worth and it may not be worth much.  I would caution anyone against obsessing too much about trying to improve sound or spending too much on trying to improve sound.  This is because I have wasted literally thousands of dollars over the past 15 years on ""sound"", from stereo receivers to speakers, to PC sound cards and headphones.  I have for a long time recognized that this has been the biggest waste of money in my entire life, as my expectations were rarely if ever met with these purchases, and many of them simply created a gigantic headache from bugs or compatibility issues.With that said, I may be hearing some improvement with the creative labs sound software when using my onboard sounds.  Again, the creative labs sound card itself, has issues as stated previously.  I tested by doing system restores back and forth.  So it's possible that my real tek onboard sound is benefiting from the Creative sound software, as it sounds a little fuller now and not so flat.  But the card itself is worthless.One egg for this."," I Installed this card yesterday.  Tested it extensively for 6 hours on a variety of sources from games to movies to music.  The bottom line is Tony was 100% right.  The only difference in sound for the sound card is from gimmickry in the software, which actually makes it sound worse.  The sound card also had a few problems that my onboard sound didn't have, such as slight crackling when playing movies.  The worse problem though, was the ""line in"" was significantly worse than my onboard one.  I ended up removing the soundcard before I went to bed. The Sound card I purchased was a Creative Labs X Fi.  This company has a long history of actually having both buggy hardware and software, which explains the slight crackling and the line in issues I experienced.  I thought that with windows 7 that I would have lower risk of having issues than with my previous experiences in years past.  Unfortunately, I had just as many issues if not more. As far as just outputting sound aside from the line in issues, I think what Tony said is 100% correct.  The Creative sound card hardware does exactly the same as onboard sound.  It simply converts digital to analogue and nothing more.  Then Creative's gimmicky software is what makes the difference in how it sounds.  But at the end of the day, the pure sound through my onboard sound, was just better, and even has less artifacts and ""noise"" than the Creative sound card.  In fact, my onboard sound has no artifacts whatsoever that I can hear.So I was disappointed.  But lesson learned."," I used Windows 7 64 bit.  I know, it doesn't list this as being supported, but I have experienced similar issues with Creative labs cards going back to windows XP and before, crackly sound and bad drivers.  So this just seems par for the coarse.",None,None

I already knew this was essentially a SB Audigy with more advanced features so that's ok. The listed SNR is @ 104db vs. the full retail & OEM version of this card listed @ SNR 100db listed here at newegg not sure about that maybe this is an older model, but i'll take it.Firstly it looked new in the white box bubble wrapped and was full of documentation plus the CD.I installed this in a 970A-G46 MSI motherboard in the second PCIe slot which runs @ 8x. It installed just fine. First I installed the drivers directly from Creative, which gave me only the bare audio panel the same as an Audigy SE, so I ended up installing from the CD (new drivers anyway) and it loaded the X-Fi type control panel with bass adjust-bass cutoff-freq., CMSS-3D, Crystalizer, EQ etc.... only one mode for this card vs. a real X-Fi (yes I had a real X-fi back in the day) but the entertainment mode works just fine.I'm a heavy gamer and I like CMSS-3D spatial gaming positioning vs Dolby that I have on my other card (Asus Xonar DG). Dolby on that card is somewhat gimmicky IMO be-it DH1-2-3 it sounds like tin-can reverb. This cards FP HD Audio case connector works great there was no loss in volume ( headphone amplification) vs. the rear connector that I could discern. Bare sound is about equal the Asus Xonar when no effects applied, and the overall volume and clarity is equal to the Xonar's ""Pro-Gaming Mode"" headphone amplifier selection (the one in the middle) so the volume on this card is just perfect. This Creative card works best with a 30-32 Ohm headset. Onboard audio is ""ok"" as it's ALC 892 Realtek but nowhere close to this card in so far as real listening and gaming/DVD with a good set of cans. What set this card apart was CMSS-3D and the Crystalizer. Oh, and powerDVD 9 was nice and it's free when you install from the DVD. Of course like any true geek I use VLC but PowerDVD 9 has a better picture, and if you get into the settings (control-c) and then audio, select ""laptop mode"" for more volume then you're good to go. I have not had any issues with the Creative X-Fi Xtreme PCIe thus far games are great movies are great! No complaints here. Was a like-new card for $25.00 shipped. Can't beat that deal.",3,3

Also don't bother going to the media website on the CD (Cmedia), they don't support drivers past Windows 8.

Once you download the drivers and install them, then you can do the real workOnce I got the drivers loaded and completed the installation, i was amazed at the crisp, clean sound for a card so cheap.  It handled my creative 5.1 surround sound speakers excellently, and the music was theater quality.  i watched a movie with this card in and it sounded almost as good as it would being in a theater.   And using this card for the games Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and The sims 4, i was impressed.

I'm running this card through a Peavey PV6 mixer into a set of M-Audio BX8a monitors and going to the RCA inputs has completely eliminated the static I used to hear on my Creative X-fi Professional (already a fine card) card when turning up the gains. With this card, I have a pair of 170 Watt monitors at around a +13dB gain before I can hear static. While this card will certainly not disappoint for the gaming or home theater enthusiast, this is really a studio level card capable of fully experiencing the sound of high bitrate audio with stunning clarity. I have not tried the recording quality as I don't have equipment high end enough to test this card, but it stands to reason that the quality is comparable to the audio: fantastic.I have installed the optional software, but have not really used it. It seems intuitive enough and rather capable for OEM software."," Cons. Funny joke on this product. The only con remotely applicable is my 4 pin molex power connector was a little tight, but this could be the pins from my PSU and not the card itself."," If one is looking specifically for a card with RCA and 6.3mm outputs, it can be assumed that the audio setup of this individual is already more sophisticated than the 3mm 2.1 speaker setup.",1,1

I upgraded from my awful onboard sound on the Asus Maximus Formula VIII. Had issues hearing voices and certain sounds in games, loud hissing with no sound playing, etc... Needless to say, I have none of those problems now. The software is way more complex than any other sound card I have seen, which is to be expected. I have been tinkering with it for hours now while playing my entire library and then some. This is the best headset sound I have ever heard. The bass is really good too with Extra gain for 600ohm headsets. It might be my headset complimenting this card, but when I am listening to music now, it is like I am in a whole separate room by myself, oblivious as to what is going on around me."," -Headphone and mic plugins are the bigger jacks that you need an adapter for most headsets if you were to plug audio and mic in separately. That's fine, but they only include 1 adapter for 1 plugin so you need to either buy another one to keep them as separate inputs or do what I did and use a splitter to combine them into one. Pretty irritating that they don't include everything that most costumers will need in the package at this price range.-The PCB was slightly warped/bow'd, which was annoying, but it works flawlessly and does not impede anything so no worries.-Asus includes awful onboard sound on their mobos and then sells you on their market leading/expensive sound cards... yeah.... I have a Maximus Formula z170 board... 400 bucks... sound is absolutely terrible.. just fyi"," I bought this elsewhere and saved over 30 bucks and had ""free two day shipping"" (wink, wink). I'm not going to lie, at this price range, I was expecting to be blown away by the sound production and this card managed to exceed my expectations despite the little annoyances. I still feel like the price is very steep, but it is the best consumer level card on the market. If you are like me and always buy the best of the best for your rig, don't think twice. DAC's are good, but I don't have a bunch of extras laying around on my desk and have perfect sound with no interference from internal electronic noises so...",6,6

The card has run without a hiccup on my windows 10 x64 machine.I usually avoid writing reviews, because I tend to vote with my wallet, but I wanted to put my 2 cents out there in case anyone is on the fence. Simply put, this is the best sound card you can buy as of December 2015. All other cards unfortunately fall short. The STX II will turn your computer into a certified source. I'm sure others come close, and there are reasonable arguments for other cards. However, when it comes to absolute sound quality and modern convenience this card is king. Do yourself a favor though, and make sure you have a pair of high impedence headphones as you wont be able to hear the nuance this card can produce without them. Regular headphones will still sound good, but match this card with a quality pair of high impedence phones from Sennheiser or Beyerdynamic, and its just remarkably good.

I have experimented this with many speakers and amps of different sizes and specs, here is my final verdict. this is what I've been up to all week. heres the pros-You can crank the volume all the way up during silence and you will not hear absolutely any hissing. WOW. you will never EVER be interrupted with any hiss while cranking it up. all you hear is the sound you give it-as of SPEAKER audio quality out of the box, it will make $50-$2000 speakers shine. if you have a $2k preamp/poweramp/av reciever with some 4 to 5 grand speakers or higher, you wont hear too much of a difference, but the difference is definitely there. but overall, it really depends on the speaker/preamp/poweramp configuration on whether it will be a huge difference or not. i promise you that it will not be a downgrade from anything onboard can give you. if you have a top tier STEREO setup, its a crisp and clear sound and using the software is a dream. if you are using VIRTUAL SURROUND SOUND, it is absolutely bar none the best for that right out of the box with some software tweaking. did not use daughterboard to make 7.1 happen, used virtual surround-headphones quality is stunning through my pioneer hdj 1500's, absolutely airy, warm, open 3D sounding and adjustable. HUGE HUGE HUGE DIFFERENCE in headphone quality. no matter what type of headphones you use, from $30 headphones to $1000 dollar cans, you wont be disappointed. I have in all my years never heard headphones sound this good. You are treating yourself to a luxury headphone experience if you buy this.-swappable op amps, (i don't recommend swapping out the headphones op amp, it is pristine just as it is and is breathtaking.) do some research and try out other op amps for speakers and see what you can do.the software is very versatile and easy to learn quickly. built in EQ, clipping/overload monitors, crossover tweaking for subs, etc. finding the best sound comes from a lot of experimenting with the asus softwarethe build quality is very premium, top grade", none," Note: the soundcard sounds the very best right out of the box with the op amp config it already has (x2 muses 8820's for each speaker, x1 muses 8920 for headphones.) for I have swapped through 9 different combos myself of the op amps that come with it. the 8920's sound bad through speakers, and are built for headphones. i'm going to go online and buy other op amps for the speakers to see what this really can do.

With the STX II you can use the H6 board to access the other 6 channels for full 7.1.  Both this soundcard and the H6 daughter board are difficult to come buy, probably because they're awesome.  I know I received an in stock e-mail from Newegg and within 24 hrs it was sold out again.  The Asus online store does not stock these either, and I had been looking for about three months before I was able to find it in stock.

This brings the headphone jack up to a more convenient location for most setups and sounds better to boot.For the one reviewer complaining about the weight, they must not have the rca jacks plugged in the back, because it is quite secure, the rubber feet keep it in place with gentle tugging, but of course its not heavy enough for one handed unplugging of the headphone jack, it would need to weight a pound for that to be possible.  Double sided take could solve this regardless, and if one is always tugging on the cord, it means they should invest in a headphone cord extension cable regardless.The volume knob is just a digital control like the volume keys on keyboards, it makes it less responsive but it also prevents the problem of the scratchy failing volume knob as they age and the pots become dirty.  Pressing the knob down works as mute, which is the only thing I use it for as I already have volume controls on my keyboard.All in all its a great deal for anyone needing better headphone output, and only has 5.1 speakers.  The next best unit the u7 still costs more, but has 7.1 output.The software is simple without much wiz bang, but that is almost a positive these days as its a nice change from bloated interfaces, it just does its job.Usb sound has come a long way, I'm late to the party but just know its a viable option now.",1,1

So keep that in mind. This unit will basically make any stereo headset 5.1. Which is awesome!! But also note that the better the Stereo headset the better 5.1 you will have.

To be fair, if you're not using headphones, all cables are behind the unit.No separate switch for headphone/mic - plugging and unplugging is the only way to switch from speaker/mic to headset/boomJack for headphones and mic are inset from the base, with a small gap between the edge of the base and the actual headphone jack. The 1/4 to 3.5mm adapter that came with my big Sennheiser cans will not fit. What good is a 600 ohm headphone amp if you can't plug in good headphones? Be aware that you may have to buy a cable-style adapter to plug in 1/4"" phones to this device."," I purchased this in hopes that I could use it for conference calls (I'm on them for many hours a day). The built-in mic array seems to do an OK job, once I got the volume set up. No complaint there - no feedback at all from the speakers plugged in to the back of the unit. So that's good.However, switching to headphones with a boom mic is possible only by physically plugging them in. I have a separate Plantronics switch that I had hoped to retire, but ended up having it constantly plugged in to the headphone jack - now, as before, it does the switching between speakers & headphones, rather than this unit by itself. It also has widely spaced jacks without any interfering frame, meaning my high-end headphones can plug in directly to it. The downside is that now I have *two* devices on my desk for audio, and I *still* have to plug the mic cable into Ito the Omni to switch to the headphone boom. It would be so much nicer to have a rocker switch on top of the Omni to change inputs, instead of fumbling with cables.

I tried a few work arounds to no avail. Rather than return the video card I began researching a new sound card. I kinda wanted to get away from using PCI anyway.I have read in recent years that on board audio has improved and that there really is no difference between integrated and discrete. I disagree.I own the ASRock Z87 PRO4, also purchased here on newegg, 2014:http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157381When my claro and video card started having the coil whine issue I started using the on board Realtek ALC892.There was a noticeable degradation in audio quality in every way.Whether games or music or even voice in teamspeak or vent.The audio quality was just not nearly as good as my claro.Everything sounded muddy, there was no separation in audio objects. It all just blended together. The clarity I was used to disappeared completely.I have specifically read articles on major review sites stating the ALC892 was virtual indistinguishable from discrete audio.You can easily search and find the same articles.So, I did a lot of research, weeks worth, scouring forums, manufacturer and review sites looking for the best sound card to suit my purposes.My use for a sound card is primarily quality audio in games but also music.When it came down to it I was between an ASUS Xonar Essence STX and the HT Omega Fenix.Looking closely at the details I discovered the ASUS actually uses the same cmedia chip that my claro used which I purchased in 2008.The Fenix uses a newer cmedia chip. Specs are essentially the same with a few slight differences. From what I can tell anyway.The only card out that has a newer chip is the ASUS ROG which isn't even for sale new anywhere I can find and is extremely expensive used.Bottom line is that the Fenix offers a newer chip and a much lower price than competitors.I know from previous experience as a customer that their quality is excellent.I am soo glad that I bought this card. It really sounds amazing.All of my music sounds as good or better than when I was using my Claro and way better than the on board audio.I can hear the slightest sounds in games which can really make a difference in competition.I am just really glad that HT Omega made this card, it is amazing.",9,9

What does this mean?  Cause I can tell you for pretty sure that this card does NOT work with ALchemy.  And you need ALchemy for Windows 7 and above if using a Creative card and you want EAX.  Games I tried were Guild Wars and Unreal Tournament and using Windows 10 with 4 channels.  In Guild Wars, normal surround sound would work but EAX option was greyed out.  Even with Windows XP compatibility mode and -dsound added at the end of the target of the shortcut.In Unreal Tournament, the surround sound would not work at all, just a simulated type surround mode with 2 channel stereo.  Even though I had 4 channels enabled in the driver.The above 2 scenarios are EXACTLY what happens when using my old creative sound card with the games disabled in ALchemy.  That's why I'm saying this card (Audigy RX) does NOT work with ALchemy.  Another clue is that ALchemy is not even a supported download for this card on creative's website.  They should not have put that quote, mentioned at the beginning of this review, in the product manual if it does not work with ALchemy."," If you're buying this for EAX in games, good luck.  I don't know what the guy 3 reviews down was talking about with ""mode switching"".  We've always had to turn on EAX in the games themselves.  And with Windows 7 and above, you HAVE to use ALchemy and enable the games there also.My other (old) card is Audigy 2 ZS Gamer which DOES work with ALchemy.  I was trying to switch to this because I was thinking they might someday phase out old style PCI slots on newer motherboards.The Sound Blaster Z is supposed to work with ALchemy and that is mentioned in the Sound Blaster Z manual.

What are you waiting for, an engraved invitation?",5," Two microphone inputs, as well as a separate line-in, in addition to the analog and optical audio outs.Much, much simpler driver from Creative compared to the X-Fi Xtremegamer I was using previously.Even on Windows 10, most of the EAX games I have tried so far have been able to enable it flawlessly.No need for a ""mode switch"" like the old X-Fi cards did.ACTUAL 7.1 and ACTUAL hardware processing like the X-Fi cards of old do, and UNLIKE the SoundBlaster Recon and SB Z line which use software mode for those games instead."," While there is no more mode switching necessary to use what this card is capable of unlike the X-Fi series the core chip is based on, it does lose some of the advanced controls that were present on the older series of cards."," Some people out there might wonder why they would ever get a sound card, when there are USB headsets and saying ""onboard audio is fine."" Well, nobody ever accused them of being correct.Even now, in 2016, onboard audio has, and always remains, terrible for actual gaming. Realtek makes the overwhelming majority of audio chips that get put on motherboards, and all of them - literally, all of them - are terrible. Even in basic Windows tasks, they have terrible audio quality, and more importantly, to use them with anything but games explicitly coded for OpenAL, they lack the punch and depth of sound that a real sound card can output. And this is the best case scenario. If you're playing anything that isn't explicitly coded for this; if you're using actual surround sound; if you're running an older Operating System, or if you're playing older games on a newer OS, you are going to quickly hate and despise how poorly they sound on your flashy new hardware.What people fail to understand, is that the audio capabilities in stuff like DirectX, OpenAL, and even the older EAX, behaved in the same way as DirectX and OpenGL do for graphics. Namely, if your audio chip cannot support certain elements or are limited in what they can do, the software API will limit what gets processed to something that the audio chip you are using CAN do. So just like you would be missing some rendering effects using a much older card on a game and OS capable of much newer graphics techniques, you too can and are likely missing much of the audio breadth from your old and new games, by using the $2 Realtek chip.Further, the thing you have to keep in mind if you want to rev up some older games on your new hardware, is the acronym EAX. So to get EAX now, you need a sound card. But to get the FULL capability of EAX, you are pretty much pigeonholed into using Creative; as tempting as the Asus Xonar series cards are, the limitation of that card is that even with GX companion hardware, they are limited to only being able to emulate EAX 2, and 5. To get all five levels of EAX, you need a Creative sound card. Lastly, at present, while one might think the more expensive SoundBlaster Z series (Z/x/R) would be ""better"" because more money, the awful truth is that that series of cards can only emulate EAX in *soft*ware. The X-Fi series, and the Audigy Fx/Rx you see here, use HARDware support. Think of it like going from the intel GMA of your work PC to running your game on an actual GPU for the first time. That's the kind of difference that a card like this can make. Yes, you need some proper speakers to better appreciate the difference. That said, if you want CORRECT audio for all your current games, all your older games, all your legacy games, YOU NEED THIS CARD. And if you finished reading all this, and still haven't clicked purchase, then perhaps you do not deserve to have your games sounding your best.",7,9

I was aware that Creative decided to offer Audigy2 support for win7 and thought nothing of it.

I upgraded from an Audigy 2 ZS Platinum with terrible drivers.  This card is very user friendly.  The drivers work with Windows 7 64 Bit no problem, and it produces nice sound.  It's very portable and convenient."," Although it's listed at 96 KHz which some would argue is better than the 192 KHz and it's probably more than I will need, it seems almost a downgrade from the 8-year old Audigy 2 ZS in that sense.  2.1 Audio is also a downgrade from the 5.1 Surround Sound on the 8-year old card but that was also explained in the description.  I'm using this with Sound Forge 8.0 and I can't get my KSM 27 condenser microphone to record both stereo channels now through the 1/4 inch jack.  It seems to only be recording mono.  I don't know what to think of this card yet."," I will keep it around just because it beats having to reboot the OS from Windows 7 to Windows XP 32 just to use the Audigy 2 ZS Platinum, but the specs seem kind of disappointing, and I really would like to be able to record both channels on my condenser microphone.  Hopefully there is a way, and I just haven't figured it out yet, but the Audigy 2 ZS Platinum seemed to do it fine.  I will probably still revert back to the Audigy 2 ZS for professional music recording :(, but use this for voice overs.",2,4

N82E16829102032,29-102-032,4/1/2012 9:32:28 PM,Anonymous,Low reviews don't know what they're talking about,5," Great external audio interface/DAC. Gives me much more response at the high and low frequencies. Line out works perfect with powered studio monitors (using with KRK Rokit RP6's + 10S subwoofer, fantastic speakers as well). Line in allows un-amplified inputs (perfect for hooking up a DJ mixer and turntables). Excellent SNR (114 is on par with much costlier DACs)."," Volume control could use some feedback- it's a smooth knob with no clicks when you turn it. Not a huge thing but pressing the button mutes the sound, but also flashes LED which is annoying. A little bit of USB noise- added an in-line RCA ground loop isolator and all was well. No dedicated ASIO driver and ASIO4ALL isn't great with this. Turn off EQ and crystalizer for more accurate sound (though some enjoy it). No 192KHz support."," None of the negative reviewers seem to know what this product is or did their research. It's a shame too- this is a really great card. While Creative's drivers aren't the greatest, they've always worked for me. For the so called DJ who said that this couldn't drive his speakers- yeah of course not- the line out is unamplified. You have to send it through an amp or use powered speakers. For those complaining of no front panel connectors, USB mic, or 5.1 surround, do your research. This is an external card, so obviously your case isn't going to plug into it. No USB mic port- are you kidding me? That goes into your PC USB port. No 5.1 surround or 3.5mm output? This is not a gamer's card- its for studio work and audiophile critical listening. Most pro audio uses RCA or full sized TRS. Take your games elsewhere and buy like a Recon3d or something.",21,21

With Audacity as the capture program the WAV file from a classical recording was outstanding.  In the very quiet sections I can hear the tape hiss from the original recording (via my pro headphones).1/4"" headphone jack is a plus for me as my pro headphones have that size plug.Volume control is a nice feature -- I can control my headphone or speaker level without having to adjust the computer level.  Twisting a knob is much easier for me than clicking and chaning the slider and hearing the resulting ping.  Also a quick push on the knob mutes the unit."," I had to return the first one because the volume control didn't work.Set up is weird.  I've got W7 64 Pro and after installing everything it still took several reboots before the unit started working.  Once running it's great.I use a Logitec USB headset for when I don't want to play through the speakers or pro headset (lighter and good for calls, etc.). Sometimes my computer won't use the USB headset, even with everything else disabled.  I think that's probably a Windows problem though.", Great value for anyone who wants to convert records to digital -- provided you've got a turntable.You will want a good click removal program and I've made digital files that you cannot tell were from an LP.

I tried taking advantage of  my realtek on-board audio but it wasnt as good as my old fatal1ty card. Enter this USB sound card and I am again enjoying playing games. In-game  sounds were now clearer, livelier and more engaging.  It was a  step up indeed  from  on-board audio.As for music playback, honestly,  I reserve my musical nirvana to my separate hi-fi system  and never use my computer  for  musical entertainment. I did try playing a CD and noticed that this sound card gave a more detailed and engaging  presentation of music compared to  older sound cards ive owned (sound blaster live!, audigy, x-fi fatal1ty, realtek on-board audio). However despite the improvement,  it wouldn't rival the output of my hi-fi system. So if you're an Audiophile do not expect much."," Minus one egg because the ""virtual"" surround mode sucks. Im sure Creative could have easily bundled 5.1/7.1  support on this card by providing the necessary outputs for 5.1/7.1 surround sound. They did support 5.1 sound in their older  X-Fi surround pro USB product and I cant understand why they removed this feature in this newer product.Contributing to this ""minus one egg"" is the extra hassle entailed in buying  two 1/8"" Stereo Jack to 1/4"" Stereo Plug Headphone Adapters   if you posses headphones and  a microphone that has 1/8"" plugs. Also Creative should provide both types of Y  RCA adapters instead of just one type ( the pic in Newegg shows female 1/8"" to 2 RCA males but my bundle came with an  1/8"" male to 2 RCA males Y adapter). I had to go out of my way to buy a 2-sided  1/8"" female  adapter so i could hook my headphone to the RCA output.This product will only work properly with a good processor and  USB 2.0.  Your old laptop may not have enough juice to run this product"," Creative should bundle two 1/8"" Stereo Jack to 1/4"" Stereo Plug Headphone Adapters and 2 versions of Y RCA adapters  with this USB card and save its customers the hassle of buying   adapters.  I also noticed an improvement in sound when i hooked up my headphones to the RCA output.

I use various music production software like Reason and given the weird setup this requires I would not recommend it if you have to hook up other devices and cant afford a 80ms delay. If you need a way to connect your home stereo reciever that has RCA(component) cables, get a female rca to male 1/8"" mini converter.If you need a premium input for music production or high quality sound get a soundcard you actually have to connect to your motherboard.If you see this for sale for <$25 then get this.",3,8

What could possibly go wrong?""",1, -Cool volume knob," So I've had a lot of sound cards in the past, but mostly ones just handed down to me or built in to the motherboards.  Since I was a kid, I always looked at Creative's sound cards dreaming of how much better they were.  Now that I have some money to dump on my computer, I see this fancy product and figure, ""Hey! It's USB! NOTHING could be easier than that!""  Boy, was I wrong.  -You can't install this USB Device with setup software from the Creative website because it doesn't detect a creative device that has been setup already-All the software that comes on the CD is old and has to be updated through the web, and Creative has some of the slowest servers on earth-Halfway through installing some of the software it just kind of hangs and never finishes installing.  After a reboot, the updater disappears.  -I would contact Creative but I searched through forums and I'm not alone.  Other people have been dealing with the unimpressive software since 2009."," Had I foreseen all of the Cons above, I would not think twice about buying this.I don't give up easily, so I'm going to uninstall all the software, even though I just did this all on a fresh Windows installation.  I'll try installing it again, with less of the bloatware that Creative has infested this thing with. I really don't need a wonky on-screen volume knob.  There's a giant one sitting on the desk, one on my keyboard, and one on my amplifier.  I'm sure I'll manage.  And if I want to sing Karaoke, I'll go to the corner bar.  Creative calls their Karaoke player a 'Critical' update for this product.*For anyone interested, I'm using Windows 7 64-bit.  I'm guessing that causes a lot of problems for this product, but I'm really not willing to part with this OS.",4,15

It is a far simpler task to click the vol-up button on the remote than to hit Fn+, double-check that I'm about to hit the F6 key and hold that for a few seconds to achieve the same result.  Oh, and vol-down, Fn+F5 is right next to the ""sleep"" Fn+ key.  Looooove the remote.Oh yeah, and everything sounds loads better, but that's to be expected.  Much like the first time you see a big action movie or video game in HD, you never quite know what you're missing out on until you drop the extra dollars to experience it."," In order to make the computer play music through the card I had to go into the computer's main sound control center and choose the sound card as the primary audio device.Sounds obvious enough, except it wasn't.  The setup instructions didn't mention this very important bit of information, causing me to stumble around on my PC and the Internet for a while before I was told the solution."," I won't lie, most modern laptops have sound chips that provide good sound, especially when paired with high-speed headphones or speakers.However, if you are either at least a music enthusiast (true audiophiles would buy this without thinking) or if you can tell that your computer is delivering inferior-quality sound through what you know are high-speed headphones/speakers, buy this card.",9,10

Not as many configuration options as a true internal X-Fi soundcard.  Sound quality seems to degrade after a while.," Why I bought this:I ran out of room on my mobo trying to run two 6970's in crossfire, so I picked this up as a replacement for my Fatality pro soundcard.  Sound quality was great, right out of the box.  Blu ray's and games sounded great as well.  Then about two weeks into my purchase, the unit started producing horrible static.  I brought it back to the store and got a replacement, which also did the same exact thing after 3 weeks of use.  I tried full uninstall/reinstalls and ran driversweeper to verify nothing was left behind.  Same results - heavy static.  I tried using an optical cable instead of the audio cables, and got the same thing.  I decided to eat the cost, and use my mobo's onboard sound. (which isn't bad, its just not an X-Fi)   Maybe it was just my luck of the draw so your experience may be different.  However, I can only report what I've experienced, which was sorely dissapointing.",7,9

No more muddy mids and over saturated lows.-Overall superior increase in audio quality. It just makes all the sounds on all levels mesh nicely.As for software, there's a lot you DON'T need to use, but its nice they included it. The EQ is nearly perfect, and the extras to help even out volume on all levels, really helps out. Lots of little tweaks and peaks you can make to your hearts content, however you'll most likely end up turning a lot of them off and using only a few like I did. Not a negative, but it does feels overwhelming initially."," -Not sure if its because this doesn't have as much memory like the desktop audio cards or what, but if you have more than say three or four of the enhancements enabled, the bass starts to dive and take over all the other channels hooked up a little bit, with all those on at least.*Nothing too major, for me at least, because I found the crystallizer enhancement to be a bit of a nuisance more than anything. It oversaturated the highs making me want to over compensate by oversaturating with low end. If you have a lot of... what we say -obtained- music with mismatched playback bitrates, it would probably do you more good than me. All my music is a minimum of 360 kpbs. Anything below that bothers me to some degree as it worsens. 360 isn't all that high of a standard either... that's basically just a ripped CD directly off the disk. Lossless sounds amazazing through this, however.-I'm rambling again...."," If you're looking for a decent replacement for on-board audio for a LAPTOP (or netbook, whatever), this is definitely one to stop by and take a gander at. It doesn't disappoint, as long as you make your EQ adjustments. Tinker away, and it'll be perfecto.If you're looking at this as a potential replacement for on board audio for a desktop, however, I could not recommend it. There are so many better options available for a tower! Get one that's not external for your desktop. You won't be sorry you spent an extra $30-$40 for a better PCI-E card.OLong made short!Get this for a laptop (dont even hesitate if this card has caught your fancy).Don't get this for desktop.

Left, Center, Right, Surround Right, Surround Left and LFE (Sub). It automatically switches my A/V Receiver into a pure Dolby Digital Signal. Audio files sound crisp and vibrant.

The DAW, REAPER, works just fine using the internal analogue system in my laptop. The DAW works fine using the interface in a Targus USB docking station.

It gives you 2 different mic inputs, the normal mic input which is just w/e sound the mic picks up. The what you hear mic input, is everything that you is coming out of the output. Which does open alot of cool options you can do with it.(I believe most creative products come with it, as i remember i had an old pci sound card with this option).Works great for headphones or external speaker systems. (ofcourse using this disables your internal laptop speakers, if that isnt obvious)Since its a usb sound card, it DOES require cpu, and it does rely on the usb controller for bandwidth.Meaning high cpu usage spikes or too much usb bandwidth usage, may shutter the audio.(mine doesnt have any problems on a 2.4ghz amd turian II dual core, even when running prime95 to max my cpu, audio never shutters)."," hmmmm, may have a little bit of low amplitude interference, but its likely just interference my mic is picking up. Would need to do alot of testing before i could say definitely whether or not this usb sound card was the cause.(and it is low amplitude, meaning unless its dead silent, you wont even notice it anyway, to even make it audible i had to increase the amplitude of the recorded sample by like 60+db lol)"," (i use this paired with creative 3D tactic alpha headset, idk if virtual surround will work with headsets not set up for virtual surround)It gives you a volume control panel, which contains the usual creative software, like eax effects, thx studio, 10band EQ, etc.The thx studio software is nice, allows for virtual surround. i keep mine at around 40%, which is best.The crystalizer is interesting, it does improve poor quality audio. But with high quality audio it makes it sound highly unrealistic, especially the highs. I keep mine at about 10%.I wouldnt recommend turning on the speaker option for headsets, it adds alot of bass, which will likely blow them out (if you want more bass get a better headset).since i see the question alot. No this doesnt make anything louder... sound cards dont make things louder.... if you want louder, get a better headset, sound system or amp.",1,1

At higher volumes the line noise is nonexistent, so it works perfectly when used with speakers where the output from the device is near max volume.

I'm pretty sure I had to warp my PCI slot a little.  It's partially my fault for getting a PCI card instead of a PCI-e version.  I read online that the front panel quality was superior to that of the PCI-e version.  What I didn't realize is that people who review sound cards and headphones are complete nutcases that like to write elaborate reviews on things they pretend to hear.  Seriously, if you are going for a sound card, you should either go for a budget card, or a pricier one with a built in amp.  Everything in the middle is a waste, and a different pair of headphones/EQ adjustment will probably offer a better experience than a new sound card.  I'm sure better products will offer a better experience, but it will not be found here."," Over the discrete sound card I got with my Maximus Formula X38, the sound improvement was very very minimal.  I basically paid for a superior EQ.  I run them with a pair of Shure SRH 840's.  Very flat headphones, but they don't react well to bass EQ unfortunately.

And I don't mean that it makes it louder.This is pretty much the first time I wholly agree with a corny advertising phrase of any product.  I am still amazed that my old $90 speakers are able to sound this good.  I am no audiophile, but the clarity, seperation, and definition of sound is pretty unmistakable here.  I do have some FLAC audio files as well as low bitrate mp3s, and somehow, even the highly compressed ones sound loads better.The win7 driver and software is pretty straightforward.  It has that old, 90s interface look but works beautifully and I love it.I also love that this is pretty much the only high-end soundcard that still comes with full surround analogue 3.5mm output jacks.I can't wait to upgrade to 500W 5.1 speakers with optical inputs next.", None really.

Tech support wanted to suggest very inelegant solutions like loosening the fixing screws for the cover, mating the header and then attemping to distort the cover enough to replace it. There was too much misalighnment for this to work. To their credit they did finally offer to replace the card. However I gave up, as this was the third card from them with problems, and took a file to the cover. If you have this problem insist on a replacement unless you are handy with a file."," The ""pass through"" SPDIF is an improvement on most other cards running under Win 7. I drive two systems, an amp and loudspeaker local to the PC, and a remote music system via SPDIF. Most MB audio systems will only supply one or the other output, not both together. However the CLARO II does continue the SPDIF output when the Speaker output is selected. However annoyingly both outputs are sublject to the same master volume control on the PC, forcing me to have an independant volume control for the local speakers.",4,6

I have an ASUS ROG Crosshair IV mobo with an onboard X-Fi, I've come to the conclusion that all onboard audio is garbage, even the ""high end"" stuff. I've also owned 2 X-Fi's and an Audigy 2 ZS(back in the day), and this card is much better than any of them.Music sounds a lot clearer, bass is definitely present but not dominating like it was on the X-Fi with crystalizer on. I hear bass on my headphones in songs that I didn't hear it in before. I have yet to try it with movies/bluray, will probably post another review when I do."," There are no color codes on the analog 3.5"" jacks, so if you're used to just being able to match the color coded 3.5"" jacks from your speakers, you won't be able to do that. I had to climb under my desk and look at the labels from the back of my subwoofer. Also, they get 5.1 wrong, it's technically rear left and right, but for some reason they call the back speakers middle left and right (which are 7.1 speakers).Drivers off the web do not work at all, it asks me to plug in the card, when it's already plugged in. This is probably a bug that will hopefully be fixed soon. Thankfully the drivers on the CD work great. Usually I just throw out the drivers on the CD in favor of the more updated ones online, but not this time I guess."," My speakers: Klipsch Promedia Ultra 5.1 500W.I will never buy another Creative soundcard again, they have all had ungodly crackling of death, and they have some of the worst drivers on the planet.You will probably need to customize the EQ settings to find one that's useful, I listen to mostly metal and I ended up using the soft rock EQ setting with the highest 2 bands dropped down a bit, to take some of the harshness off.",9,10

Turns out by the time this mute on the surround speakers can kick out, I've already missed any audio email alerts. Between Windows 10, my motherboard and this soundcard there is no way to record ""what u hear"" or a ""sound mixer input"".  Its been left out.  So, I can't record any streaming audio.  Researching this and not fully understanding what I'm doing, your supposed to be able to download a generic ASIO driver.  I fouled with it for hours and never could get it to work.  The only work around I've found for being able to record ""what u hear"" audio is to use a 3.5mm splitter on the soundcard's front output speakers  and split that to the same soundcards line input. Testing this showed a loss of volume of about 12-15% and doing a white noise test surprisingly didn't show any fidelity loss.

I don’t hear any of that annoying static deep in the audio.4. I get extra features from the CD where I’m allowed to Opt my game audio on listed games.5. The Sound Blaster control panel was easy to understand.6. Says here I need 1GB RAM (Random Access Memory) and an Intel chip with 2.20 Ghz+ (I'm glad its not demanding),"  1. Although easy to install in your PC, the CD installer gave me issue in the program it installed for (auto updater)? It kept claiming that services are too busy or whatever, to be able to update/ I don’t even know what its updating exactly (Drivers? Software for control panel? I don’t have a clue). 2. Another feature installed by the CD was that once scanning my PC for hardware or software for info it registered Windows 8.1 64bit (an OS I upgraded from, into Windows 10) so the software thinks I’m on windows 8, doesn’t seem to give me trouble at all but its slightly irritating for me to read mistake(s).2. When I started with everything freshly installed, the sound quality from my music were fine and I didn’t get any static or disturbance. But! I noticed a small Tron like voice quality at the far end of my music but vanished, I don’t know what that’s all about but it might be the hardware and software adjusting as the Sound Blaster is at work."," We would have liked 7.1 Surround sound, but those are hard to find especially on a budget. But this 5.1 delivers just about the same quality that I wanted (mostly didn’t want static somewhere in the back of my music) (and yes this will cure that static issue) The Bass quality is a bit better than using Realtek Sound quality. But at least Realtek enabled me to hear from all 6 angles for speaker setup with my headphones, while Sound Blaster only allows Left and Right features and not back and front audio stimulation of speaker placement, hope it’s not hard to understand.[[If your a windows 10 user, skip using the CD installer!]] you want to go to Creative's page to download the software that fits your OS, click on the ""Software pack for windows 10"" you don't want the update version (make sure to hit Agree to start download when you solve the small math question to identify if your human..

Since my onboard audio started having distortion, I needed a new card and I am glad I went with this one. Out of the box, it's a nice product, install is fast, the supplied CD with Driver installed straight up into Win 7.I don't know why people bash the software that comes with, I find it complete.. It has a lots of Eq, a high and bass sliding bar and even has a crossover frequency. Not sure what other would like more than this but I am happy with the software suite.Although this card, does not have any optical out and 7.1, I didn't want those since I only play with headphones so 7.1 was useless to me and I don't play on HTPC so optical was not necessary. Would of been nice if it was there but not a deal breaker for me.Sound wise, I have a pair of Kingston Hyper X cloud and this sound card has dramatically improved my experience, the sounds is so much clear and the bass in deep for a pair of headphones.

It was only then I discovered it has a  Realtek sound chip.  I contacted Creative support about the lack of Stereo Mix/What U Hear recording capability and they simply stated that it was not supported on this model.  Between this and the overall lack of sound quality, I would not recommend this card if either of these two attributes are important to you.  I will say this: the card produces some loud audio to the headphones due to the 600 ohm amplifier.  Loud and Bad are not a good combination, though.  Trying to get the audio to not sound ""muddy"", or at least equal to my onboard sound  was an exercise in futility.

Lots of things to mess with to get the exact sound you're looking for."," What should have been a 15 min install took hours. According to the user manual - They say that this card requires a 4 pin power connector. So with that in mind I pull the back side of my case off, dig out a cable, move my graphix card to the bottom x16 slot, end up accidentally unplugging my hdd, pulling a pin out of 1 of the molexes, sliced my finger on the case unplugging stuff/plugging back  in, unplug my main monitor's adapter.. (all separate issues i had to troubleshoot individually, l,m,a,o) only to get the card plugged in and find out it DOES NOT require a 4 pin power.So I start the computer, windows sees it, I install the driver, and it says ""please connect the sound card!""  Weelll.... w,th,f... This makes me think that it actually does need a 4 pin power connector. Google everywhere, check the card again for the 982705534th time for something I missed. Nope. **YOU HAVE TO DISABLE THE ONBOARD AUDIO IN THE BIOS BEFORE INSTALLING THE DRIVER**  This I kinda figured I would have to do to get sound, but didn't think it would prevent the installation of the driver.

I guess it was an issue with older cards, but the cd that comes with it works just fine)It's hard to get it to sound decent at low volume levels when you're trying to be quiet at midnight-1am+ but after messing with everything forever, I got it sounding good. Just choose the Bass preset and turn up your mids/highs a couple notches."," I thought about giving this 2 or 3 eggs just because of all the b,s I had to go thru. If Asus would actually update their user manual instead of re-printing old ones, I would have been done a long time ago. That aside, this is an awesome card.

I got this card cause I have the Turtle Beach DX12 DSS2 Headset.

It comes with control panel software that allows you to adjust input, output, equalizer and THX sound configurations.  The gamer accessories go mostly unused as I rarely play online, but the surround sounds perfectly fine.

There were conflicts between the card, the motherboard, and the graphics card. The only solution was a virgin, pure, clean install of Win7 with an install of the sound card drivers immediately after the basic install."," Some graphics cards have audio drivers (mine was Radeon 7950) that will conflict with this audio card. If this happens to you, you will need to remove *all* of the graphic cards drivers before attempting to install the Creative Recon3D. If you have an ASUS m'board, check the sound settings in Device Manager. If there are any ""HDMI"" listings,  disable them. For those who earlier were complaining about sound quality, they should go into the Sound Blaster Control Panel and make adjustments. Distorted sound was resolved quickly and easily by going into the Control Panel, and disabling the ""Surround Sound"" option. For gamers out there, Rift, Guild Wars 2, and all the other MMORPGs have crystal clear and awesome sound with this card!This update has five stars.

For those thinking of purchasing for anything other than fps games, please look elsewhere. Even Asus's Xonar DG (which is usually around 10~15$ with rebate) is MUCH better quality in terms of music/ movies. For the price point, I would look into deals on Creative's Titanium HD.

I played METRO 2033, and I was closing my eyes when I was in the market to see how many voices I could locate just based on sound, using the mouse to turn in the direction I thought the sound was coming from, and then opening my eyes to see if I tracked it right... Every voice was tracked, and it sounded very natural. Wow!I read about this card's ""horrible"" ability to process great sounding Music and Movie playback. So naturally, I was expecting to hear ""flat"" audio, and ""unclear"" mids and highs... I must have received a defective card then because I what I heard in Music and Movie playback was great! Audiophile quality?... um no, but you have to remember that REAL audiophiles would NOT be using a $150- $300 sound card to use with their $5000 amp, and $6000 headphones! Everything I heard, from gaming to music and movies was done over my Audio Technica ATH-M50 (Not the absolute best, but very high rated headphones indeed)"," None that I can think of, does everything I need it to with games music and movies! The music was very clear, so I'm not sure what other people that say that this card blows for music and movie playback were talking about?? Is it the clearest and cleanest sound? no, but again what do you expect for $150 *GAMING card, remember....GAMING card."," The card has very deep and ""punchy"" bass, probably leans more towards the ""punchy"" side, but still very satisfying, so you may want to adjust your equalizer to lower the bass levels a little to compensate. I didn't notice ANY hissing or popping that others have talked about with this card, at least no hissing or popping that wasn't already there in the music itself.Overall I think this is a great card for the cash, awesome  3D positioning that has to be heard on the latest games out there to be believed!

Said software suite is much, much more stable and clean than old X-Fi. TruStudio surround effect is adjustable and, IMO, distorts the sound quality far less than the X-Fi's CMSS-3D. CrystalVoice, when used with a quality mic, cleans up voice excellently.It does 5.1."," Included beamforming mic isn't too great, it's just alright. Price is kind of ridiculous, definitely not worth the price for the Fatal1ty Professional over the standard PCI-E Recon3d, which is already a ripoff. The components you are paying for that your modern mobo doesn't already have: headphone amp, persistent red LED. Hell, your mobo may have the LED already. Increased FPS, they claim. Really? People with this kind of money to burn on a PCI-E device have processors that max load on all cores, eh? Taking the time to offload to the card is probably costing you 0.5 FPS, if anything.Sound quality is noticeably inferior to old X-Fi Titanium, although after awhile I got used to it. Actually, this ""soundcard"" is statistically inferior to higher end motherboards onboard solutions.It doesn't do 7.1. My motherboard does."," Well...this card serves 3 functions for me:1.  An internal headphone amp.2.  The CD comes with great software.3.  Another case light? I like lights.If you don't care about surround/simulated surround, get Creative's own X-Fi Titanium HD. Works great with regular stereo headphones and 2.1 speakers. If you want 5.1/7.1, get the Creative X-Fi Titanium or X-Fi Fatal1ty Pro. Great for surround speakers or true surround headsets. Not those fake USB ones, ones with mutiple headphone plugs.",14,18

It does everything with pure clearity. Awesome clearity, nice surround effect with the headset. The card takes it's power from the PCIe slot.No driver issues. Not even a single BSOD.And there's one more, though not something to be very excited of. It's light comes off cool and makes my PC look more beautiful. There are air openings in my case and the light pops beautifully out of it, giving two advantages of if the card is still running good or not, and a good look."," I couldn't find any definitive user manual. Just a small installation instruction guide was given. Lack of 7.1 support, but that's not much of a con. First time I tried to install this on my pc, it stopped in the middle and i was able to find out that my realtek driver was blocking it. Then I removed the realtek driver, popped in the disc, and it ran great.No deduction of egg for these,coz there is no problem to this."," I can't say about its stability, but with the way it is going on with a Pentium D PC, it seems rugged and drivers are stable.Much recommended, but it's little brother, the Recon3d PCIe could be a better choice for gamers, though it lacks the Beamforming microphone and the good looks and some features ( there's very little difference b/w the PCIe and PCIe Fatal1ty Pro in terms of processing power and features it seems )",2,4

I've run head-to-head tests against a Creative Labs AUDIGY installed in my other computer. I can take the output from each computer and feed an input to the same speaker since this Altec Lansing speaker has dual inputs. Very convenient for a situation like this where you want to do a comparison. Using the same music player, feeding the same speaker, playing some of the same music tracks on both computers, one the Audigy, the other this SIIG IC-710012, I must say the SIIG is noticeably better. This approach allowed a back and forth comparison, with only a few seconds delay between listening to the Audigy and then the SIIG, then back to Audigy, then SIIG again, doing this several times. The SIIG does sound better. But I can't really compare this card to the Realtek drivers and the on-board motherboard sound chip since I had to uninstall the Realtek drivers before I could use the SIIG so that is an impossible comparison to make."," Right on Page 1 of the User Guide booklet, the 3rd item down, it states as follows:""Supports 24-bit/96khz playback, 16-bit/48khz RECORDING""That's from the horses mouth guys. The mfgr states clearly this card WILL NOT RECORD 24-BIT files, so if you're planning to transfer some of your vinal LP albums to computer files, this is not the card to have. If you want to create computer / digital music off your vinal LP's, go get a  32-bit sound card, as anything less is just shooting yourself in the foot."," On the main info page for this product, Newegg shows this product as:Digital Audio: 24-bitThat is deceiving because it only PLAYS 24 bit files and I don't know what good that does because everything one finds on music CD's is all 16-bit. All the "".CDA"" files on a CD are 16-bit, all the stuff you might download from one of these popular music stores is 16 bit, so what good is it to be able to play 24 bit where the only place you'll encounter a 24-bit sound file is the one you make yourself, from injecting audio from your own turntable or cassette tape deck, but you ain't gonna do it with this card cuz it can't make 24-bit files.

Every card including onboard HD audio uses ""matrix mode"" when listening to music, just on the current release you don't have to enable it, it is on by default. This is because mp3s are compressed cd music files. No studio records a cd in surround sound, only 2 way stereo, which is why you use matrix mode to fill all the speakers with sound.

9SIA4RE4VX3588,29-102-043,1/27/2013 7:49:40 AM,Anonymous,"Resource Conflicts on Win 2008 Server, very noisy internal FP interface",2," I purchased this card to replace the sound chip on my Gigabyte motherboard (note: if you're doing this, make sure you DISABLE the onboard audio in your BIOS!).  Plug and Play seemed to work without a hitch on my Windows Server 2008 R2 system (I use WS as my desktop so that I can use Hyper-V to host multiple virtual machines on one physical computer). The improvement in sound clarity is noticeable--not dramatic, but noticeable. Bass is solid, and the highs seem more clear. Using my front panel headphones, however, I now have a much higher level of noise carrying over/leaking into the cable.There's lots of ticking/clock signals, and a steady white noise, which *isn't* due to the cable. I haven't tried rerouting the cable yet, to see if I can at least reduce the ticking sounds.The DSP allows me to sample in 24-bit resolution at higher bit rates, which is important to me because I am using it to capture/convert analog audio from cassettes. Better A/D conversion going in means a little less work during the sound restoration phase.The 3D sound enhancements on this card are impressive. They enhance the stereo image without sounding artificial. I don't normally have this turned on, however, because it's vital that I hear the sound of the raw footage that I am editing, but I do occasionally like to play around with it when listening to music."," When my system runs scheduled tasks at night (backup, defrag, virus scan), this card starts to stutter and stall during playback, to the point that sound becomes modulated or choppy. It doesn't do it during the day when the system sits idle, but if an editing session runs late into the night I find myself cursing Creative because of this. I NEVER had this issue with the on board sound chip.This appears to be due to a resource conflict with the card, specifically, with the IRQ 16 line that it shares with other devices. PCI is supposed to prevent this, but either the OS is failing to resolve the conflict, or Creative has failed to follow standards. I've read more than one blog post that suggests the latter. <sigh>"," A sound card has two purposes: to playback sound accurately, and to accurately capture sound in digital form. This card struggles on playback when the system is even moderately utilized. I could not recommend this card to anyone, despite its stellar quality when it does work. I might be able to ""tinker"" in the BIOS and make all kinds of manual settings to compensate for Creative's lack of planning and/or compliance with standards, but a better use of my time and money will be to ditch this thing and get another sound card, from someone besides Creative.",None,None

You then run the ""Downloader/Updater utility"" to download the actual components that you want, and spend another 2 hours pausing, resuming and restarting the 140MB update download.  The last time the drivers were updates was June, 2010.

I found out later that the noise I was hearing in my headphones from my front audio was actually coming from the front audio and front USB ports sharing a common ground creating a ground loop.  To test it I plugged in a usb hard drive into the front usb and plugged my headphones into the front audio jack:  man you could hear everything that drive was doing!  I was able to plug my headphones in the rear, and it sounds great (as do the speakers).  To be sure, I have a ground loop isolator and plugged it into the front audio port and then plugged my headphones into it.  Dead silent.  No noise.  Found out too that a lot of cases do this (search on Google for it).  Even high end cases have this issue.  It is not the card: it's your case.  (in my instance an NZXT Vulcan.)  There's permanent fixes too to separate the grounds, which I may do so I don't always have to have my ground loop isolator handy.", Creative still needs to improve their drivers., Not as bad as I had previously thought.

Getting this card to install was a pain, thanks to Creative's awesome drivers (sarcasm).  This card replaced my Audigy 2zs Platinum Pro (it got evicted because my new video card blocks all my PCI slots...so I was forced to find a pcie card, and I wasn't going to tolerate onboard audio.)  At any rate, even after uninstalling my old drivers, I kept getting an error saying more up to date drivers were already installed.  I finally had to manually delete any and all registry keys from my old hardware (even after Driver Sweeper and CCleaner).  Then I was finally able to get  the driver to install.  Had a firewall issue blocking the auto update, but fixed that.  Also, popping and crackling issues seemed to come when I changed 'Modes' while audio was being played.  Went away after reboot.  (Even says on the mode switcher in the audio control panel that it is recommended to quit all audio applications and games before switching modes.)  More in other thoughts."," Another issue is that this card either picks up more noise or doesn't filter it out as well as my Audigy 2 zs PP.  Even with the volume all the way up on my old card there was very little noise.  This one I can hear all kinds of system stuff (when using my speakers or headphones.)  It's very annoying and sounds as bad as my onboard audio.Having dealt with Creative on my previous sound card I was seriously considering another brand, but lured back by the cheap price, and game audio support.

Forums are littered with complaining people.  Threads are constantly deleted for minor infractions.," -You must use illegal, modded patches in order for the card to work.  CL sued the maker so finding the patches are tricky.  Once it's working, it's all crackly and none of the features work.  Spent an entire weekend trying to get this to work.  CL's website clearly states that it should work with Win7.  Newegg's product description USED to say it (though it also didn't work with Vista).

N82E16829271006,29-271-006,10/5/2015 8:05:05 PM,Bretton F.,Beautiful soundcard aimed toward audiophiles,5," This is a really nice sounding soundcard!  I consider myself somewhat of an audiophile and bought this card as an upgrade from a SoundBlaster Z (mostly because I wanted 7.1) and I wasn't expecting to hear a serious difference, but I really did!  The card sounds very clear and its been working really well for me for music and games.The d-sub connector is also very nice, at first its weird, but the first time you have to disconnect the cable you realize how much easier one d-sub is then 6 stereo cabled!"," That being said, the card is clearly aimed for audiophiles more than an average user.  I have a FiiO X5 (gen 1), and this card reminds me a lot of it.  Very powerful and clear, but rough around the edges.  The included software works perfectly fine, but it not very user friendly and looks dated.  The software was tons of options (input, output, mixing, pro logic, speaker placement, effects, bass crossover etc) but everything needs to be done manually.  So when I listen to music (2 channel), I need to manually set the input to 2 channel (you don't have to, but it if you don't you can't use pro-logic and other 2 channel specific features), and the same applies for games, you need to set it to 8 channel for the best experience.  For an average user this is a lot of work and some convenience features are missing (my old SoundBlaster had a toggle for headphones or speakers while the eClaro outputs on all channels all the time requiring you disconnect/mute the devices you are not using)."," Overall this is a really great card, but if you are not an audiophile this is probably not the best choice.  The rough edges do weaken the user experience, meaning that you have to place value on getting the best sound for this card to appeal to you.  For an average user, consider the cheaper and more user friendly SoundBlaser Z series, for the audiophile, the add to card button is right up there!",None,None
N82E16829271006,29-271-006,2/14/2015 6:04:36 AM,Charles P.,Sounds great,5," The sound clarity I get from this card is better than previous (Creative) sound cards I had used in the past, and much better than the on-board sound of the Gigabyte Z97 Motherboard I recently purchased.  It gave new life to my (great) Logitech Z-5500 speakers, I didn't know they could sound even better.The 3D surround sound is just incredible and so smooth, in game transitions between speakers is leaps above anything else I have previously used.Installation of the drivers and software was very quick and easy (I followed the directions of disabling on-board sound and uninstalling any other sound drivers prior to installation, and also temp disabling the AV during driver installation).It comes with some fairly sturdy looking cables and attachments."," Expensive.Outdated looking software.  Does not install to the Control Panel in Windows 7, so if you ever uncheck the ""Display System Tray Icon Box"" the user GUI will disappear.  I couldn't find it anywhere to open up the settings.  The sound card still works, but you cannot change any settings at all unless you reinstall that I could find.  That is definitely something should be fixed.  If I am wrong, anyone can email or message me about it.  Note: I actually did this as a test, I didn't accidentally uncheck the box..."," The sound card comes with the larger bracket installed and a smaller bracket available.  I had to loosen the one bracket screw on the card and slightly adjust the (larger) bracket so the card would sit squarely in the PCIe slot and attach properly to the case.  Only mentioning this because I have seen others say that it won't fit on the motherboard without popping out.As long as this sound card lasts, it will have been worth the extra money I spent on it and I gave it 5 eggs despite the minor cons I mentioned.",1,1

N82E16829271006,29-271-006,11/29/2014 3:25:22 AM,Matthew K.,Very dissatisfied - Get a different card,1," Jack in back for dedicated headphones to be plugged in while your stereo is still plugged in. Sound can come out of both at the same time, and you don't have to juggle playback options, just turn off your speakers and put your head phones on. Sound quality is good. You don't plug your inputs right into the card, but through an adapter with separate cables for each audio line; which feels weird at first, but it turns out to be pretty nice. The cables are clearly marked and color coded with enough surface area that you don't need to bring a flashlight with you to make sure you're plugging into the right jack. Makes setting it up easier, especially if you're say under a desk, or going to a LAN party."," Drivers will not install 80% of the time. Does not matter if I use the CD that came with the card, or go to the website, when I start to install, the bar will fill up completely and then sit at the end for 5 minutes, and then an error message saying, ""Please connect a HT Omega Device!"" will show. I tried different expansion slots, made sure on-board sound was disabled, (tried with it enabled as well with no luck) have done a series of re-formats, flashed my mother board's bios, attempted other drivers for similar HT Omega cards, and nothing helps. Sometimes after just repeatedly trying to install, restarting, and trying again over the course of a few hours, the driver's WILL install, but every time there is still a problem or two. Currently my card does not recognize my center speaker on my 5.1 speakers. The cable and speaker DO work, because I switch the plugs into another input jack, say front speakers, and when I test for sound; it will play through the center speaker. But when I do this, the plug I switched the center speaker with (so in the example the front speakers), will not work. Other problems in the past include the microphone sending a high pitch noise in the background, which would become unbearable if you used Mic Boost. (I even bought a new headset, just to make sure it wasn't my old headset, but the problem still persisted.)  I started having issues within a few weeks of receiving the card, and looked into returning it with Newegg but I did not have the original packaging anymore, so they would not go through with it. The UI for drivers, if you can get them to install, doesn't look professional. I understand that they wanted to focus on functionality, which is great, but when a customer is shelling out nearly $200 for a card, I would expect the software to look like a graphic designer played some part in the development cycle."," I know it seems like I'm being unfair, and that it sounds like I have an agenda to fill, but I'm not someone who usually complains. (I have over 7 years of providing customer service under my belt, so I understand what it is like to be on the other side of the counter.) I genuinely regret this purchase, and all wasted the hours of my life on troubleshooting the myriad of problems that came with this card. In the past, my sound cards were always Sound Blaster Audigy, and always worked great. I'm not sure why I was looking into something new, when I knew of a product that works and meets my expectations, but I was shopping around and saw a lot of amazing reviews about the sound quality, and how audiophiles love this card; I went out on a limb to get one myself. It has been a huge head ache on so many issues, and when I was spending a premium price for a sound card I expected so much more. I would not recommend this product, not even this brand/manufacturer, to any of my friends and family, and even you -potential customers. I got the card in June of 2013, only a year and a half ago, and I've decided to rip the card out of my rig, and just use on-board sound until I can get a new card. I really wanted this card to work out, but take my word for it, and look elsewhere.",1,7

The Bose speakers desktop speakers were crackling and popping that I attributed to poor quality audio files and streaming media.A friend suggested this card for a rebuild, and once I got the 64bit drivers for Windows 7 loaded and configured, it's been beautiful ever since. I use a Razer Tiamat 7.1 headset and exploit the hell out of positional audio when gaming, and toggle over to feed the optical out to the home theater receiver when not using those, no more popping and hissing, and much improved dynamic range from the Bose speakers.When I moved for a year, I lent the original card I'd bought to a friend who had a Creative  Sound Blaster F4tality melt down on him, and he liked it so much he wouldn't give it back, and it replaced his Macintosh for sound editing work in his band's studio.",4,5

Wont make you a better at life but it will make you believe it does. If you actually bothered to read the cons in this review you yourself are not experiencing to amazingness of this sound card.

Both sound cards work flawlessly and have given me years of service."," I contacted HT Omega about some general questions concerning optical out. Their response was cryptic, and so I sent an email back asking for a number to call so we could have a brief conversation because i have about 30 questions concerning the interface of their card, how it processes sound and how the optical thruput arcitecture functions. Their response was this: 30 questions are too many and that I should send them another email prioritizing the questions. Really? With a $180 price tag for just a sound card, I would expect their customer service to be phenominal. I would expect them to appreciate their very small customer base that is willing to spend as much as a motherboard for just a sound card. For shame HT Omega. The whole tone of the email conversation from HT Omega seemed like they were irritated that I even contacted them."," Their niche is very small to start with because very few will ever consider a sound card like this.

Like the other reviewers have stated the software seems like it was from the 80's or 90's but honestly I would much rather have rock solid, consistent software than new buggy software that always requires updates so in that sense this card and its manufacturers are great and the software is very functional which is all that matters to me."," I've had the Creative X-Fi circa 2006 and then I got the HT Omega Stryker 7.1 and the creative had some good sound it was good for gaming but the software was a bit buggy at times and it was almost to crisp sometimes. The HT Omega Stryker I had owned had great mid range sound and it was good but not for gaming but this card sounds really crisp and clear and feels powerful. I love how I plug in a D-Sub I/O and then I plug in all of my side rear and subs into the cables that then come out of the D-Sub connector.Overall I happy with this sound card I had an Asus Xonar DX 7.1 and that was great but it didn't have that rich, powerful, crystal clear quality to it that this card has and I am so glad I gave it a chance.

After a reboot it simply works perfect. No 20 minute B-S driver install like a Creative card. The entire process literally took all of 5 minutes.Truthfully, the analog out on the ASUS board really isn't half bad - IMHO onboard always blew until the short-lived Soundstorm 2.

Super flaky.I finally just uninstalled my Nvidia sound drivers to see if it would help...BOOM! Perfect installation of drivers and software.The software is so bare bones I probably did not even need it - which is great! You get good hardware, don't muck with it via software, let it do its thing. On that note, sound is incredible. It was noticeably better than my Creative X-fi Titanium some lame gamer sound card (their flagship card before the current Recon) even with low bit rate content.Don't expect this card to drive any high power headphones. I knew it didn't have a dedicated amp but it's advertised in such a way that makes it sound like the jack can drive some decent cans and from what reading I did, it sounded legit. Wrong. This card couldn't hack my 300 Ohm Sennheiser 650s; couldn't drive the bass properly. I wasn't totally convinced that this card would handle the headphones, but it was a let down all the same.Side note: I have my card in a PCI-E x4 slot. Works fine. Bracket came warped a bit so that the card did not make good contact in the slot when tightened down. Just bent it slightly past straight in the other direction to ensure all the pins make good contact in the slot.",10,10
N82E16829271006,29-271-006,12/4/2012 9:09:27 PM,Craig A.,Still the best out there.,5," My motherboard has what's supposed to be an excellent sound chip in it- and for stock, it is. See: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128545 - the Gigabyte ga-z77x-ud5. It uses the Realtek ALC898, which is about the best stock chip available. But....it isn't even a candle against the glory of a clear dawn when compared to this card. I had an old PCI Claro- one of the first efforts by this company- and when it finally died (after almost 8 years) just before this build, I was planning to use the Realtek ALC898 and call it good enough- and it wasn't. A lot of detail, depth of field, and sonic accuracy went missing- I actually thought my ears might be going out on me- but the wife backed me up when we sat down to do some critical listening to several ""reference"" pieces. I just installed the eClaro and it's all baaaaack. I'm using an LFO interconnect to one of the better Denon receivers. I'm running two Velodyne S-1200's, a Velodyne ULD-18, and five Velodyne DF-661's in my home theater/audio rig (yeah, all old stuff, but hellishly accurate). The rest of the computer isn't too exotic- a Corsair Gold rated 750 watt psu, an older GTX-470 for the video card (largely overkill for everything I do, including SkyRim) 16 gb of ram @1600, an Intel Cherryville solid state drive for the OS, and two WD Caviar Black 1 tb spinners in a mirrored raid for storage. But...this system drops jaws- and the sound card has a lot to do with that."," The software interface is, well, clunky. It inspires the suspicion that this company is slowly coasting into obsolescence on the glory of one great achievement. The dongle appears to be a hack- but it allows the use of the included low-profile bracket, so if you're building a high-end home theater in sometjing like  one of Silverstone's low profile cases, you'll be gratefull- or you'll use the light fiber optics output and it won't matter. Be careful of the filter capacitors used on this board- they're tall, and the exposed metal surface could short out components on another board- like your video card. if you place this card close to another one, you can top them with plastic disks and a little silicone adhesive (my fix) or use little squares of electrical tape- but it's a potential disaster if you have a tight case and you don't use caution.The board also isn't in a faraday cage like some of the other audio boards out there- but this mother board and cpu produce less rfi than a lot of the older gear because it's more efficient- less power means smaller magnetic fields. That could pose a problem for people with an integral wifi; my wireless connection is on a USB cord and lives about 8 feet up a wall behind a curtain- so that's not an issue for me."," Cons notwithstanding- if you can afford this card and if you have aspirations of acquiring decent audio gear- buy this card or you'll never know what you're missing- because you'll never hear it. If you have no interest in good audio, if you think Blows Audeeyo is great gear, or if you believe MP3's are the be-all and end-all, stick with the onboard sound chip and save yourself two Franklins. You'll never hear the difference.",7,7

Really makes use of those high quality speaker systems.- 24-bit @ 192 KHz- DSP for 7.1 -> 5.1 emulation- Software has some great functionality; mixer, equilizer, ""FlexBass"".- Swappable OPAmp.- Output -> input loopback ""device"", allows for easy recording of anything output to your speakers, also useful for things such as soundboards when you're trolling people on audio chat services.- Smaller than I expected, too used to only having a enormous graphics card as my only PCI-Express device."," - The case audio connectors I have, AC'97 and HD audio, are both 9-pin. The eClaro has a 10-pin connection. Had to bend one of the pins to plug it in, but it works just fine.- Like some other reviewers have stated, 5.1 is certainly quirky. When windows is set to output 5.1 at first, works great. Using the included software however screws it up, I figured out that you should read the labels on the connectors and not assume the colors match. The orange connector on my speakers was supposed to go to the yellow cable on the d-sub breakout adapter, not the red/orange cable on the d-sub."," Aside from the very weird channel color mismatch on the break out adapter, this card is fantastic.",6,6

I did some research, and decided to try eClaro out. I must say eClaro offer same sound quality as STX out of the box. Replaced installed OPAMP with LME49720, my HD650s and IE80s sounded more detail, however, with STX, you can further improve the SQ by replacing other opamps for I/V and buffer. But they really don't make much different for me because my ears are not that sensitive. 5.1 analog output isn't exceptional from D2X if you ask me. I have a set of Klipsch 5.1 ultra, and surprisingly the SQ seems better coming from SPDIF than analog. But you are serious about sound quality, you should listen lossless music collection through stereo, not 5.1 speakers anyway. Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase.

The fact that i can plug in the front audio to the card is a nice plus as well.," When I got this card installed, I had nothing BUT problems getting it to work. While installing this card's driver's, it would terminate part way through for no discernible reason. After the first install I restarted thinking it did some 'Behind the scenes' finishing touches. I got no sound upon restarting. I turned off my MB's front panel audio and tried again. Still no luck. I then started uninstalling drivers thinking maybe it's a compatibilty issue on the software level. I could get the drivers to install (properly) after uninstalling my nvidia graphic drivers, but I still could not get any sound. Too make things even worse, I had a few times when restarting that my MB wouldn't recognize the HD. I had to take the battery out of it and put it back for it to start back up properly. After 2 times of this happening, I called it quits as I was afraid it may get worse.", Probably a good sound card if I could get it to work.

It is difficult to justify the purchase of a sound card that is this expensive. You will need high quality speakers and headphones to take advantage of the sound this card provides.• Headphone amp is too close to the analog output adapter.  If your headphone plug is 1/4"" and uses a 3.5mm adapter, you most likely will not be able to plug it directly into the card, and will have to use the 3.5mm extension cable that comes in the box.• Front audio pins face downwards.  I have a crossfire setup, with a video card one slot below the sound card.  I cannot plug in the front audio cable without it being in the way of my video card.  Not a big deal, but something to consider.• The manual is lackluster, and much of the text in both the manual and the HT | Omega website has grammar mistakes or is oddly worded.  It almost seems like it was written by a non-native speaker of english, which is odd for a California-based company."," Overall I am satisfied with my purchase, and feel confident that this is a card I'll be able to use for a long while.

Went from laptop headphone output (to z-5500's) to this from a desktop, and Boost 11 sound setting on the z-5500 is lower from the laptop output, than 30% when using this card. (boost 11 is past 100% for when you have really quiet tracks for z-5500 users)2. Sennheiser HD 598's sound amazing. Almost too amazing. Black Sabbath sounds really, really flat :(.

Headphone, console and optical out are too close for my liking. (Read other thoughts)2. the 3.5mm m/f extender is unreliable. It cuts off if you move the wire. Low quality.3. The Front Audio plug on the card itself is not accessible if you have another card the pci slot below the sound card. for me, my video card is in the way, so i have to use the headphone output on the back4. (nit picking) The console plugs for analog output are labeled weird. ""Back"" and ""Rear"" both sound like they could be used for the rear speakers in a 5.1 setup. ""Back is for the rear speakers"" ""Rear is for the side speakers, in 7.1"" Though all you have to do is read the manual to figure this out, I think they should have labeled Rear, Side."," 1.(See other thoughts, extended) I bought the Sennheiser HD 598 headphones with this sound card. The headphones come standard with a 6.3 jack, and has a 3.5mm adapter. But this adapter's radius is too large for the console output to fit with it plugged in. I know this is not a problem with most people, and even less because most likely their M/F 3.5mm extender cable that comes with the HT omega card will work, but for me it did not, so I had to purchase another.2. I don't know if its the headphones, the sound card, windows, or a setting that I have yet to discover, but my headphones (Sennheiser HD 598) don't sound like they are able to get very loud.

The control panel for speaker settings is intuitive and precise with highly detailed control options for speakers2.  Graphic equalizer for wide frequency range settings3.  ASIO driver with 1ms to 2ms response time even when feeding midi signals through a USB input device - fast and solid response time in audio recording applications4. Low profile and therefore allows for better airflow to hot multi-gpu configurations when there is no room for a PCI card5. Digital output cable and output onboard - easy setup to connect to your digital receiver for programmable audio processing - makes surround setup in your home far less complicated6.

After everything was assembled, the system powered up, but wouldn't boot. Several e-mail conversations with HT Omega's support team later, we were still stumped, even after they generously sent another card which produced the same result. Stumped, I asked if I could exchange those cards for this one and pay the difference. They agreed without hesitation. The eClaro is now installed(using a PCIe x1 slot!) and my system is working perfectly. And now that it is, there IS a difference from the onboard audio. Many say that soundcards aren't needed anymore since onboard audio has improved so much. That may be true, but most aren't using quality speakers like Logitech's Z-906's like I am either. S/N, stereo separation and the Xear interface all go further to improve the audio experience. Pair that with using the optical output and you get absolute clarity and purity.", none," I just can't say enough about the HT Omega support team!! Truly an outstanding experience.

This company is above and beyond any of the other companies in this department, e.g., Asus. They give same day (or 1 day) responses to emails.-Ability to change opamps and gives remarkable sound.

Sometimes (meaning it doesn't do this every time) when I restart my computer, it will just ""hang"" and not reboot into the BIOS and then the OS. I can manually restart it, but it is kind of annoying. I think it's a motherboard/BIOS issue, but I'm not sure. Despite this being annoying, I don't have the heart to mark off an egg for this. HT Omega support is currently helping me resolve the issue."," Like someone else said, the least you should do is change out the JRC4580 with an LM4562, or the newer LME49720 (same chip). The 4580 isn't bad, but really there are much better. The highs on the 4580 are too harsh and artificial sounding on my Sennheiser HD600s. The bass is too thick and muddied.I went the extra mile and soldered an OPA1612 SOIC onto a DIP adapter. The sound is absolutely stunning. This is in my opinion THE BEST opamp. Period. Perhaps the AD797 or OPA627s are slightly, but they can't be driven with this sound card -- their required voltage is too high at around 4.5~5v. Indeed, I put in a THS4032 (req. 4.5v) and it was much too quiet, even with Windows sound turned up to 100%.TLDR; Don't use an opamp that has a voltage requirement above ~2.5.

I had been wondering if it was time (post-Vista) to get back into a real sound card.  Wonder no more!  This card is fanastic.I built two identical computers, one for me and one for the wife.  I wasn't sure about the sound card, so I only ordered one.  That allowed me to directly compare the sound, same songs, between the Realtek ALC889 on the Asus P8P67 Deluxe and this HT|Omega eClaro card.  The difference is night and day.Individual notes on a piano are vibrant and sharp.  Horns are brassy and warm.  Guitar strings are resonant and trail off slowly.  Solo instruments, in particular, are just dazzling.  The Realtek onboard sound, now that I had something to compare it to, sounded like it was muffled, muted, like it was being played through a blanket.Great in games.  Great in voice chat.  From roaring dragons to low rumbling caverns to the sound pure silence and dripping water.  Awesome."," Probably need to buy one for the wife now.Making me seriously consider taking the time to rerip my whole music collection to lossless WMA.Might even need to upgrade my old Klipsch speakers.  Now we're talkin' money.And I guess it's worth mentioning that it costs about as much as a good motherboard.  There's a reason it sounds this much better that the ""free"" sound.One Egg... had to install drivers twice on Windows 7 64-bit to get it fully installed.  Couldn't find any way to make 2-channel music play through all four of my quadrophonic speakers, just the front two.  Software drivers a little obscure in general."," Brand new computer and I found I spent my first Saturday morning just listening to my music collection again and upgrading songs to 5 stars.

This card has served me well, working flawlessly on Windows XP 32 and 64-bit, Windows Vista 64-bit, Windows 7 64-bit, and even Ubuntu."," No 24-bit/96KHz support.  However, it is a $20 card, and some people have got it on sale for as cheap as $10 or less, so really... you can't complain. Spend another $10 or so if you want 24-bit. No big deal.The Diamond XS51 is really a re-badged C-Media card, and this (as you can see) causes much confusion when it comes to finding the right driver. They should update the supplied disc with the right drivers as they are easily available on the Internet. The amount of 32-bit XP users are dwindling, Diamond!"," If you use any decent hardware monitoring/benchmarking program (such as PC Wizard) you will easily be able to determine who actually makes the chipset upon accessing your sound card info. It is a C-Media Electronics CMI8738/C3DX to be exact. Do a search for that and you will find drivers. To all of you who are frustrated and cannot get this to work, that is your answer. Do not rely on the supplied disc to get you anywhere. Now that you have the model number you should have no problems. I've gotta say though, XP 32-bit, Windows 7 64-bit, and Ubuntu found the driver automatically for me. I do however recall having problems in XP x64 and Vista 64-bit. Not sure why everyone else is running into problems. Perhaps your card is a variant and uses a slightly different chipset?

After buying a Logitech X-530 (something like that) I was unable to hear sound from all speakers and needed a new sound card that supported 5.1 surround sound. I found this and bought it, mainly because of the other reviews and price."," The microphone jack never worked for me. At all. In order for other people to hear ME and not screeching and static I had to re-enable the onboard sound device and plug the microphone in there. The drivers are buggy and hard to navigate through. There's no ""Speaker Fill"" option (like Realtek driver config has) which didn't render the best sound in my speaker system. It still gave me sound through all speakers, though. Their support is some of the worst that I've seen. I'll sacrifice USA support for actual support any day. I had a question about a driver installation issue that was never answered. Ever. I ended up solving it on my own. When I tested the Windows 7 Beta (RC1) they had absolutely no drivers for Windows 7, I was told by someone on a gaming forum that my best bet would be to install the Windows Vista drivers on the Windows 7 installation. I got sound, but had no control over the configuration utility.

You have nice control over the equalizers, and can vary it to a limited degree using a somewhat tempremental response from your mouse. It'd be nice if you could punch in a number with a rough approximation between the -20 dB and +20 dB but you cannot. The sound ""environments"" are interesting. You can play the sound as if you were in a padded cell, underwater, in a music pub, a concert hall and 22 other options that get more absurd. Changing the frequencies is more effective, with a total of 12 preset variations. You can define your own, as well. The Environments are really just a poor addition in my opinion, and you'll most likely stick with generic, being the base simple clean environment.

9SIA0ZX2C37523,29-111-003,11/28/2008 9:01:09 PM,Anonymous,"Works in XP x64, good sound",4," Had to buy this the other night at a B&M store, since my onboard ALC850 unexpectedly started to die on me (left channel all of the sudden stopped working, wasn't the motherboard jumper either). Sound quality is very good, and is what I would expect from a sound card in this price range (actually, it exceeded my expectations a bit in that regard, as the packaging reminds me of questionable 1990's ""value"" computer garbage). Takes some load off of my nearly obsolete AMD dual core CPU. 5.1 support if you need it."," First of all, while MY ears can't hear much of a difference between this and the ALC850, there is a review that shows a test with onboard ALC8xx vs. this card, and the ALC8xx represents the original sound wave better after being fully processed. This likely won't concern you unless you are a total audiophile. Yes, I also know it's a cheap value card, but standalone cards are supposed to be better than onboard solutions. That's one of the reasons why they're still on the shelves, despite the fact that every board these days has integrated audio. Secondly, there's no 24-bit/96KHz support. Finally, the game port is kind of stupid. Everyone uses USB these days. I'd rather have the game port gone so the card can be slimmer. If you have a MicroATX board, and a graphics card with a big fan, I can see the size of this card being a problem as it most certainly would block much needed airflow for high-performance video cards."," To get this to work in XP x64, simply go to Windows Update or have the new driver wizard search Windows Update. It will install as ""Matrox Audio"". You will have to use Windows volume control, and not the software that it came with, as it's simply not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Not that big of a deal to me, I output everything to two 80W speakers and apply BBE and extra bass through the receiver anyway; cheap audio effects really haven't impressed me since I was like 13. That said, not everyone is like me, and may appreciate these features; it's not hard to have 64-bit support available, be it on the disc or web. So, others may find the lack of a 64-bit sound manager to take advantage of effects and such a bit unfair, and I can't blame them for feeling that way.",1,3

Good value for the quality."," Terrible driver install. I work on computers as a source of income, and have installed hundreds of components, and installed or upgraded countless drivers.  I am fairly certain that Creative's driver installation was about the worst I have ever encountered.  The installer added a ton of startup applications plus a couple of services (including a very dubious digital rights management service).  On top of this, it was extremely slow and unstable (it crashed multiple times).  Not only did it add AOL shortcuts in several places, it also tried to change my security settings to give AOL access to my computer as a trusted site.  Microsoft Antispyware and Norton Internet Security had a fit with it and I suspect that might be why it kept crashing.  My (rather high end) PC started booting up more slowly and acting sluggish until I removed some of the extraneous components and services from startup."," The card is great if you can get the drivers and software for it configured properly.  The software is quite intrusive, and I would recommend that people be very careful about which components they choose to install.",1,2

I don't have any need or desire for more than a good pair of stereo speakers/phones.I stuck some active monitor speakers into the RCA and it's awesome and perfect for what I need.," It's a bit dated with the pci connection, but who cares - It plugged right into my new asus z97 board.It might be overly loud in the high mids, or it might just be a truer reproduction than what I have had in the past. I write and record songs as a hobby and once I get some of that going I'll be able to tell between source and output to a high degree. I might play around with opamps, though i have no idea what they even are as of now.", I didn't want to spend money on a bunch of useless 7.1 nonsense (IMO). I wanted a good headphone amp and RCA outs with sound above the consumer level and that is exactly what I got. It makes the asus on-board junk sound like a cellphone in comparison.Happy with this one.,1,1

The card gives your computer an audio makeover!  however....," ...The supporting software is terrible, The UI is complicated and its difficult to guess which settings are right for you're setup because well,, it doesn't tell you (the instructions are ok, but while changing settings there are no indications as to what is happening). Most importantly, either the software or the card itself refuses to encode any subwoofer audio. I know my sub works, but something about the digital (optical) signal sends no sub channel, so my monitors are left high and dry. With both music and movies and on all audio settings (that I could figure out, again the software is lacking hardocre) while running audio to my receiver I have never had the sub produce any bass whatsoever. Either I'm doing something wrong (software!!!!) or something is wrong with the card. Also I've had the card for about four months now, never once has the downloaded software prompted me for an update, so I question the amount of effort this company puts into staying up on recent technologies, and improving the customer experience. Its as if their business model is set and forget. They release the product with a quickly assembled software package and forget about it forever."," Seriously, the software. Ive heard this card do its thing (mostly, remember no sub) and its an awesome piece of hardware, if they would just give some effort for the customers experience with operating it properly this would be an easy slam dunk five stars. I would have given three eggs, but for the price and with the seemingly total lack of product support or software updates i'm tempted to give just one egg, but its too good of a card for that so two it is.",5,15

9SIA0AJ3TB7183,29-271-004,2/10/2014 10:03:32 PM,Anonymous,Looking into the future with yesterday's technology?,4, *  On-board 600ohm headphone amp*  Front-panel header, *  PCI connection only*  Rear-panel outputs aren't LED-coded (Personal preference)*  Analog output is limited to 2-channels without the optional daughter-card.," The Claro Halo was purchased to replace an Asus Xonar D2X that had several capacitor legs dry out and give way.  While both cards are based on C-media chipsets - and thus have very similar performance - I feel that the Claro Halo is better-suited for those looking to use their computer for individual entertainment use and not as part of a home theater PC (HTPC) system.  While it supports 7.1 channel output through optical, it does not support any surround-sound setup 'out-of-the-box'.  The Xonar D2X had support for 7.1 analog output as well as optical in/out all on the back card.  That brings us back to the differentiating, and defining, feature of the Claro Halo, the headphone amp.  Good for up to 600-ohms of impedance, the Claro Halo allows users to plug in audiophile-grade headphones without requiring an external amp (some users will want to use an amp of their choice).  As I have not used external amps, I can not attest to the the relative performance of the amp, but am stating that it is a strong feature for those looking to primarily use headphones.  To further emphasize the single-user focus of the Claro Halo, this card has an on-board header for front-panel connectivity - a feature sorely lacking on other cards of similar performance.  This makes it very easy for people looking to use headsets to utilize the card's dedicated hardware without having to route cables around from the back of the computer.As the Claro Halo uses a C-Media chip, the drivers and interface for the card are very similar to what other cards will have.  The same options are available but presented in a different manner.  Those looking for a stylized presentation such as the Xonar experience will need to look elsewhere as the control panel is packaged in a very traditional window-with-tabs layout.  That said, there's no difference between the two as far as feature-set.The biggest drawback to this card is the fact that it utilizes the PCI connection.  While many off-the-shelf computers may include PCI slots, the interface itself is now qualified for induction into the Smithsonian and a relatively poor choice for product longevity, though I suppose they could release a PCI-Express version later.  In addition, the card does not focus on analog output and will require the purchase of the optional XT board to allow connectivity to an analog surround-sound system.  Again, if you're not looking to use such a system, you'll be fine with the main board alone.  However, if you want the full analog out package, I suggest you look at the Claro Halo XT package or look at a different card with full analog out support.On a personal taste, I miss the LED-lighting of the outputs that the ASUS Xonar D2X had.",12,13

Probably has to do with the quality of your case.  This, however; is not a problem for me as i have the Silverstone case where all of your cords go into the top of the case rather than the back.", I also highly recommend the Silverstone 90 degree rotation cases for anyone who messes with sound and recording on different devices.

These are NOT for those with rinky dink satellite speakers.. they are for those with nice bookshelves at the bare minimum, but mostly the biggest gains are from studio monitors."," Old school looking software, but a very minor con."," OUTPUT ANALOG... I cannot stress this enough. If you are buying a sound card like this and outputting digital, you are NOT taking advantage of the glorious DAC in this 8788 chipset that is basically what makes this thing shine.. more than any other component.. You have to spend about a thousand dollars on a Stello External DAC to go beyond this type of sound clarity.. So if you output DIGITAL, you are just bypassing the DAC to be handled by your receivers, which is guaranteed to sound inferior unless you've got a $1000 Marantz.",5,7

If you have $300+ save it for an outboard headphone amp/DAC combo, you'll be happier.

I have a set of Grado SR125i's and if you have done any head phone research at all then you know these are some of the best cans you can buy on the planet for the money. Finally....finally I have all the volume I want. That has been the problem with on board sound or any other sound card is not enough volume and if there was enough volume it was terrible sound quality.That is all good now, amazing detail, awesome lows. The entire spectrum is so much clearer and warm. No harshness just good clean music that so far never fatigues.Also there is none of the noise that some reviewers claimed to hear. Most of the time I contribute those types of claims to be some thing else in their system causing the problem.Anyway, get this card if you are an audiophile at all. You wont be so"," None come to mind except maybe the software that comes with this card. It could definitely be better.Come on HT, spend some of those profits on good software."," The source is only as good as the signal path, in other words of you don't have quality cans, speakers etc, you are getting a great source of music until it hits the speakers or cans.

Awkward situation beliesIf you have a gaming graphic card installed on your motherboard, now your problem's here:Your graphic card would definitely invalidate the PIC slot right next to it for the sake of heat dissipation, therefore, there is literally only 1 standard PCI slot left for you, so using this card basically eliminates the possibility of using any other standard PCI card, which can be intolerable in certain specific working enviroment.Therefore, be sure you dont have competing device installed before purchasing this card.Asus's Xonar uses the tiny PCIe, which's been proved to be a bliss.2.

Like everyone else notes, you don't expect that on-board sound can be dominated by an add-in sound card.  Wrong.  The Claro Halo has amazing sound quality when paired with a high quality amp and speakers.  The headphone amp is fantastic, but make sure you have proper high end phones in order to enjoy it.This sound card makes games sound amazing.  The clarity is stunning, and playing a game like BF3 is eargasmic.  The sound thunders.. is crisp and clean, and hits remarkably hard.  Turn up your amp and your neighbors will think there is a war being waged in your house.If you're a gamer, do what you have to in order to get the gear you need.  That includes high end CPU's, GPU's, amp, speakers and the Claro Halo.  Otherwise you're not getting the most from the time you spend with games."," The Claro control panel does not match the panel described in the manual, including the manual you can download from the HT Omega web site.  The functions are mostly the same though. Also, the EQ has a bad interface for saving user presets, although once you have them set, you shouldn't need to modify them. It takes some experimenting to figure out how to use the DSPs and get proper surround sound.  The ""system input"" must be changed every time you go from listening to 2 channel music to surround sound with DVDs or video games.  They should have a detection mode that does that for you.  Set it to 2 channel input with the 7.1 virtual speaker for MP3s, and 8 channel with DTS Interactive for games and movies.The control panel also doesn't remember your selection for dolby headphone mode, and you'll have to click it on each time you play games with headphones in order to get surround sound.  This is a major oversight in the control panel."," The default headphone mode is low impedance.  Make sure you change the jumpers on the card for your high impedance phones before installing.  Don't bother upgrading to a high end sound card unless you have a high quality amp and speakers to connect it to, unless you intend to only use headphones.I use 2 GTX460s in SLI and the only available PCI slot is between the 2 video cards.  The Claro has capacitors that are tall, so the sound card barely fits.  The caps are pushed up against the video card case.  If the video cards were any wider, it wouldn't fit which worries me about upgrading video cards.  Also, the Claro blocks half of the exhaust fan of the upper video card but it doesn't not affect temps.  If the GPU fan were closer to the back of the case, it would be completely blocked by the Claro.",6,6

This card is very solid as others have stated and if your install cd came with the marking version 3.0 no need to go to the website to install drivers this cd has the latest drivers on it for windows 7 64bit, the drivers on the website are a year older just to give ya'll a heads up. The software on the install disc is the same as what I had on an auzentech sound card that I used (it died after 3 years) so I was familiar with it and love it.

Once I put this card in, it was perfect quality, both in the low and high frequencies.I've been building computers for friends and family members for about 13 years now and this is the best i've heard. I used to own the Creative Audigy 2 ZS card, which was also a $200 card but drivers were buggy and software was glitchy. The only thing that card had on this was 1/4 inch inputs for musical instruments...for example, if you had a guitar.Setup was simple. Put in CD, Click next, the bar goes to 100 % and then restart. There's no selecting what all you want to install. The interface is simple but very detailed with effects, bass freq cutoffs, 10 band equalizer, voice cancellation, and key shifting.

I would never buy a $5000 amplifier or $500 cables. I can't afford to!  You reach a point of diminishing returns where spending twice as much doesn't yield a significant improvement. That applies to almost anything... sound cards, speakers, cars, toaster ovens. The Omega Claro represents what I consider the point of diminishing returns for sound cards. Yes the Claro Halo sounds better than the Striker (I have one) and the Striker sounds better than the Brand X card it replaced. Money well spent. More money equals better sound. But don't bother looking for anything better than the Claro. I don't think you'll find anything better at any price.

I have Sennheiser 555 headphones and have never realy heard how good they can sound plugged into a computer. I have some classical guitar and some classic rock in FLAC files that sound like I am sitting on stage. I can hear some muted strings and buzz on the bass strings, in some classical pieces I never heard before. The entire mid range is full. No system buzz!!! My daughter can pick up sounds I can't >18K that she did not hear before either. The headphones I use are rated at 50 ohms - big coil on the speakers compared to little earbuds. The sound card has low (<32 ohms) and high (32 ohms -600 ohms) impedance output you can change with 2 jumpers.

It will be used in stereo configuration for the time being.Installation was fairly simple.  Still trying to figure out the interface, has quite a few options which I will probably never use, but there if needed.  Has a wide assortment of I/O's including headphone, and comes with a fairly decent set of included RCA and fiber optic cables. I have the RCA's hooked up right now, and am quite pleased with it so far.  I think it will sound even better as it burns in.

No crackly sound that I've heard about on the Creative and Creative based cards.  High impedeance headphone amp.  DD Live and DT Live means I can use the optical output and get rid of the 3x analog ones.  Swappable opamps.  Includes cables for the L/R output, very long optical cable, and a headphone cable extension!!  Those alone would probably run 1/5 to 1/4 of the card's price if you just went out and bought them."," none so far.  Well, it won't support the newer proprietary EAX formats but having used onboard sound for the last 3 year on Vista, I'm not really worried about it since that didn't have the newer ones either.  That could be a con for some if you really have to have the EAX stuff."," Unless you buy the XT model, you will have to have a device that accepts an optical input and can decode dolby digital or DTS if you want to get surround sound of any kind.  I have a Yamaha theater in a box with receiver and speakers connected to my system so no issue there.  I wanted to get rid of the 6 channel analog setup anyway.  The headphone amp with Dolby Headphone is awesome.  I'm using the Sennheiser PC-350's which are a high impedance headphone so they need a headphone amp or other powered source besides a soundcard's standard output level to drive them well.  Putting the headphone amp's jumpers to high impedance mode on the card drives them perfectly.I'm not currently using the L/R analog outputs because the included cable was too short for my setup, the optical cable was more than long enough though.  I want to connect those outputs for music listening in 2 channel mode since they are fed from the same high quality front channel opamps as the headphone output.",2,2

Has DTS and Dolby headphone as well for those that watch movies and game.  HT Omega has great customer service!, None that I can think of other than none," I have also tried the Asus Essence which is also a very good card, but does not have DTS and Dolby Headphone.  At this price range things like that make all the difference and you can actually find the XT card for this if you really want to.  I have used the Striker card for other builds and it is also a great card.  look at the Newegg reviews for this card and all the Claro cards and note they are all 5 eggs.  What other sound cards have that?  Only the Essence from Asus and none of the Creative cards as they have horrible drivers.  I am using W7 Ultimate 64 bit and no driver issues.

Dolby headphone mode, and the 7.1 speaker shifter really makes everything sound great. 192Khz/24 bit(need i say more? ) Has optical in/out, and RCA, and extremely simple to install."," Some gimmicky sound options such as ""flex bass"", and the dolby/dts neo modes really don't do anything to enhance the sound. The headphone amplifier isn't exactly what it says it is either . Even with the jumper impedence switched to ""high"", this sound card could not power my sennheiser HD580's with the authority i wanted. Even with the volume and the levels maxed out, it just didn't power them the way i thought this sound card would be able to do. But, once i plugged my klipsch s4's into it,(which are low impedence phones) the sound just came alive and i have been happy ever since. For medium to low impedence phones this sound card is the best on the market, but if you have higher impedence phones like myself don't exspect this card to blow you away.",,3,4

A high end set of headphones and a quality recording will put you in the orchestra.," The card will incode a source to DTS or Dolby Digital and send it out on optical to a capable tuner but it does not DECODE a source to be played through a conventional software player such as Windows Media Player.

The headphone amp is a very noticeable compliment to my Sennheiser PC350 headset (read the manual to get the full effect from the amp). The control panel offers a large variety of different configurations, it took some time playing with all of them (and reading a few forums) to fine tune them to my personal taste.

I used the latest Drivers from the HT Omega Website, and was amazed to find that the sound card worked beautifully on Windows 7 x64 without any hassle, unlike Creative X-Fi cards I've had in the past. The sound was perfect: no more pops, cracks, or electrical interference 'whines' from my Video Card (even with a giant gtx280 sitting directly next to the HT Omega, no interference!).The Claro Halo sounds excellent. I didn't realize what I was missing in PC Sound until I heard this card: it's hard to describe. I use headphones quite often while at the PC, and this card has been a dream come true for my uses."," None. Seriously, what you see is what you get. I was not disappointed."," I have struggled with a fussy Creative X-Fi card for the last year that never fully worked due to Driver issues with Vista x64 and Windows 7 x64.  The Creative Card finally bit the dust last month (good riddance), and my onboard sound was not happy with the new Windows 7 operating System, and never fully functioned.

For me, it sounds like I'm at a live venue.Seriously, the Claro Halo does not deserve anything less than 5 eggs!For those who are running multiple dual slot GPUs in SLI/Crossfire and depending on your motherboard, you may need to remove the backplate off the second GPU to accomodate the Claro Halo and not bend/break one of its capacitors.

My only disclaimer is that I'm NOT a gamer, so I can't speak to that. I own a boatload of high-quality material, all of which sounds gorgeous with this card. I've spent alot of time ripping my stuff to digital format and storing it on PCs, and I wanted a sound card that didn't make me feel like that was a waste of effort. As others have said, the headphone amp DOES make a difference if you are listening to high quality material. The drivers are solid, and the tech support is excellent. These guys know that a lot of you out there are searching for an alternative to Creative Labs, and they know they have the bull by the horns. Like you, $$ are hard to come by for me, so initially I balked at the price for this card. I searched everywhere and was persuaded by a very successful recording engineer to try this card.

Keep in mind that the default setting is limited to low impedance output sufficient only for 32 ohm headphones (perfect for Grados). You must locate and switch the jumper setting to increase output. This card is also set up to output to both the front channel/headphone and the RCA outputs, another jumper mutes other outputs when headphones are plugged in to the front panel.Once properly set up, this card brings the best out of stereo recordings. It eliminates any noise caused by system components and renders sound with very low distortion. Swappable Opamps allow modders and audiophiles to easily customize the tonal quality of analog outputs.Supports a wide array of Dolby technologies and 5.1 channel digital output.

The icon for the original Recon3D (latest creative software and drivers) was blue themed, now for the new up to date software and drivers for the the Z series the icon is red themed and everything works faster. and of course we get the bright red led, imo personally, i don't care for it since i have a red and black case theme as well as rgb strips set to red and other components that are red and black themed such as water cooler and graphics card, ram, wires etc. It fits my case theme and if anything if i want to remove it i would just take the sound card apart and solder off the led or change it to a different colored led (not hard for me but hard for others if they want to bother).I am all for faster software but not if it should cost me for buying a card that has the same processor and software, especially since the program works the same and looks and functions the same as the previous but only now, 5 years later they no longer support it and literally left their old card that was based off the same processor for dead when it could function the same. Therefore, this loses 1 egg. This is literally the same card 5 years ago except they just redesigned the the board and other components, it's a shame they no longer support their originating line of Recon3D other than just supplying the unupdated software.",None,None

In games such as World of Tanks, instead of the powerful booming sounds of the guns, I get wimpy bang - bang. So boring. One of my favorite vocal bands is one called Home Free. They have awsome sound and extreme bass. I can't even stand to listen to them with this board. I have been so spoiled by the XONAR which is so very clean and powerful - no comparison at all & at about 1/2 the price......   I contacted SB by chat tonight, somebody named Lorenzo. He had no solutions and basically said they were sorry, WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?? Tomorrow, I will switch back to the ASUS and sell this thing online for $50.  So disappointed.

There is a workaround that some people have been able to do, messing with the drivers and whatnot.

Usually use Asus and other well known cards. Used to avoid Creative for some problem I had back in 1991 I cant even remember. I fried another Asus Xonar DSX card.....tried to replace it with an external Asus card...huge install problem and conflicts. Went to Best Buy and bought this card today for 91.00 with tax. Have not used the little knob control that comes with it. What I can tell you is the sound is like nothing I have heard on a PC yet. Its ....there just are not enough surpurlativves to cover what the sound is like. Clear....angelic, warm, deep...bass on bass with amazing highs. It's like having a whole new computer. I have all this high end gear...head phones and 7.1 Klip speakers....equalizers and great mics (I do live streaming of games on a high end rig on Twitch TV)....and this sound card made all that sound like its finally using its full potential. I'm can't stress enough. The sound quality is at LEAST double....probably more. If you think your getting a good deal out of a 35 or 60 dollar Sound Card with high end gear .....you have a huge bottleneck you wouldn't believe till you hear the difference. I like Newegg and have been a customer here a long time so I preferred to write this here instead of Best Buy.....the price here is cheaper too btw...if you take free shipping.", Little large for a card.....chunky. Takes a PCI Express ONLY and its own power plug from the power supply obviously. Not to big to cause install problem but in a tiny case it may cause a bit of a headache., Has a super cool Red glow on it.....light effects. I have a blue system inside with blue lights and liquid cooled blue fluid pumping inside the case. Really adds a great effect. Looks very High End. Like a 1000 dollar Graphics card or something. Nice addition to a Modded case. Again....just cant say enough about the sound quality. Brought my kids in to hear their fav games over the headphones after installing and they just couldn't believe it.  You could get the model without the little controller knob if you want to save a little. I didn't even install mine....not exactly sure what its for to be honest.

Just the boost in power is freaking amazing!!! I didn't really need the 3.5 mm dongle, bot oh wells the price was $10 difference so why not. You have to go through the settings and set it to Dolby digital live. Then go to your audio playback and make sure it is set as creative speakers. The dolby live digital will send a optical out signal. Just I'm hearing thing's I've never heard before using the mixamp with the 600 ohms amp.

The audio representation really took my Denon beyond what I had thought were its limits. The software suite allows many possibilities for those that take the time to get to know it on speaker at a time.," Ok, this is where this thing falls flat and why I knocked an egg off. Rediculous install issues and DRIVERS!!! Come on Creative Labs. Get with the rest of the world and make drivers that just work. A company as old and big as Creative labs should not allow things like thos to happen and If I was not a pc tech this card would be back at the vendor in blue and yellow. It seems in some cases you need to have extensive knowledge just to get this card to work. This was on my Asus Sabertooth 990FX. First it shows up as a Sound Blaster Z and a Recon3D. Seriously. Windows actually had seen it as though it were 2 different cards. If this happens it is frustrating to get going. This card is not a simple plug and play card. It is top notch but Creative needs to make Unified software based of hardware codes or firmware IDs. The way it is now is bad. Also you absolutley must use creative labs software for full feature set."," Where to start. I have had a discrete audio card before. I have had external usb driven cards like the SB1290, a few c-media boxes and an old SB Xfi Titanium SB 0880 I never got to use due to MB compatibility issues on 2 different Asus boards. I really did not know what to expect since I believed my onboard alc892 was great and the SB Xfi GO SB1290 did wonders for my Polk audio headset. I had no idea how wrong I was. This card has beought new life to my audio gear. You can hear the difference after doing the needed tweeking which can take quite a while. My onboards was 7.1 and I prefer this card due to how more dynamic and how the clear the sound is.The SB Zx SB1506 is a solid product but that is only if you can get it to work. You need to check and see if it is compatible with your MB before buying. Even if it is you may still encounter issues installing. Creative requires you to disable all other onboard, USB or GPU HDMI audio device due to conflict with software and hardware. Do this first. Then the next thing to do, to not encounter issues as many others have like the Recon3D issue, disable windows update for drivers and just leave it off. You will need to update all drivers manually from the moment this card is in your system as long as you have it in there. Then when or if windows installs the card and it shows,in the device manager uninstall the card and be sure to check the box to delete the drivers. Restart then open device manager and scan for hardware. You need the card to show as and High definition audio device nothing more. if it is,showing Hogh definition audio device down load the most recent drivers from Creative Labs website for the card. For windows 10 it will be the august 2015 driver, other versions use the last 2014 driver. Install the driver as admin and you should be good to go. After all is installed Hook up all connections and the ACM to the card and restart. This should help many and is probably the best way to ensure the card installs properlt with no driver conflicts or mistaken idenity of the card.",2,2

I absolutely love the sound quality that you get from using this card. I'm so glad that I no longer have to do with the intermittent crackling and popping sounds associated with creative's last flagship soundcard. The audio control module is very useful with not only 3 1/2 inch headphone and microphone jacks but also quarter inch., The LED light on the card is a nice touch and even though I had read about how bright it was you really can't comprehend it until you own it. Thankfully I do not leave my computer on 24 seven anymore and it isn't a problem for me but if you're the kind of person that leaves you system running 24 seven you might want to try to think of a way to cover up the lightNot really a con but when I was first thinking about buying this card I was disappointed to see that a front panel bay was not included. My sadness however vanished when I saw that creatively included an HD audio header for front panel connections on the card, I bought the soundcard to replace my six-year-old creative X FI titanium champion series card because the software kept crashing when I tried to use Windows 8 and with Windows 10 looming I figured it was time to finally upgrade. Every time creative releases a new card they seem to outdo themselves and as long as you have a good set of speakers and a pair of headphones you can definitely reap the benefits,None,None

I use JBL 4434 monitor speakers and this card really lets them shine. The difference this card made to my overall sound was amazing.  I use FL Studio a lot for my guitar and piano recordings and this card has not let me down. ASIO ready! Desktop control module is nice. I can use my 3.5mm to RCA for my monitors, 1/4"" output for my AT M50x headphones. 1/4"" input for my guitar and mic preamp. Pretty versatile unit. Highly recommended", Some of the software control isn't the best but does give you some options. I don't use it because I need a very flat frequency response for most of my work. I have used some of the EQ stuff just to test it out and you can really get the bass pumping out and highs singing through the mix., Really great overall card. Not ideal for DAW work but it still does the job very well. Will make a huge difference for anyone wanting better sound out of their rig. Highly recommended.,None,None

You are able to switch from speakers to headphones with ease."," The ACM reduces sound quality. The difference is slight but if you enjoy getting the most out of your hardware (which I do) it leaves you wanting more. I also think the ACM causes some 'crackling' at high volumes, but I can't confirm this. I eventually switched to plugging my speakers/mic directly into the back of the card because I knew my sound quality had more potential. I took out 2 eggs for this because the price gain of the zx from the z is the ACM."," It's a shame the ACM ruins the relevance of buying a zX. Just buy the Z, you'll save some money and your sound quality will be better without using the ACM. I use Beyerdynamic DT880's with this card and at about 50% volume level in my mixer I am able to hear the 'edge' of all footsteps in CSGO (no need for scout mode). No one has a competitive advantage over me while playing this game as I can hear footsteps from the farthest programmed point. Sound quality for music is great especially if you are upgrading from motherboard sound. The DT880's are known for accuracy and the Sound Blaster Z will give you a nice accurate and clean sound while supporting a high ohm frequency. Their really is no need for using equalizers when pairing a clean and accurate headphone/soundcard combination. You will hear things the way they were meant to be heard.",4,5
N82E16829102049,29-102-049,9/6/2014 3:19:20 AM,Johnathan L.,"Great sound, terrible drivers.",2," -Sound quality, by my ear, is great, especially with a decent set of headphones. -The card looks pretty good, though the EMI shield may potentially make for a tight fit in some systems if you have all of your slots occupied. -The beamforming mic is actually pretty neat when set up properly. It can be a bit finicky however, depending on where you place it. -The UI for the Pro Studio application is slick, decently laid out, a bit slow to start up sometimes but otherwise a functional ""all in one"" application for configuring the majority of your sound settings."," -Drivers are, as is typical with Creative, subpar at best. They have not realeased new drivers since January 2014, and these drivers only updated ALchemy and OpenAL, the remainder of the drivers do appear to be untouched since mid 2013, based on file dates. -I have had constant issues with channels randomly switching, sound clicking, popping, random volume changes, etc. I have effectively been told to ""deal with it"" and Creative refuses to acknowledge that this is even a problem (the forums are littered with others with similar issues as far back as the release date for the card.) There is NO support for this issue and I have seen no official acknowledgement of the issue. Creative seems oblivious, unfortunately. To that end, it feels as though Creative has effectively abandoned support for the Z series cards, at least as far as drivers go. Nobody with Creative seems to know if they're releasing any new drivers any time soon, if at all. -The included ACM is a great little piece of hardware, but I've noticed static developing as I turn the volume knob (probably due to the rheostat design, turning it back and forth to clean the contact strip fixes the issue for a while) and it has been confirmed that running your headphones through the ACM WILL degrade sound quality. For some this may not be an issue but I very much prefer a direct connection for music and movies."," I really like the card - I do. I just can't stand the constant problems. I've tried every ""fix"" imaginable but nothing works consistently for everyone, some argue its a driver problem some say its a PCI issue, but nothing consistently fixes the issue. The first agreed step is to revert to the .16 drivers, the FIRST drivers that released for the card. Get it together, Creative. I've bought a LOT of your products over the years and this is the second time I've been burned. I will no longer be buying or recommending your products any longer as I do not feel confident that you will continue to support your products with decent, regular driver releases or acknowledge common problems with said products.The card sounds outstanding, sound quality-wise, I regret nothing, but the random sound channel switching problem more or less negates the sound quality benefits when I'm losing channels randomly or having them all reversed at random.",5,6

I havent had any issues with it and setup/installation was simple.Comes with a connector in the back of the card that allows you to plug in audio cables from your case, Hard to see where you plug in speaker jacks (left/right/center). Wish it was color coded. Just be sure to pay attention when installing the card so you know where to plug each speaker into.No difference from the card that is currently 82 bucks on Newegg. You pretty much pay the extra 60-70 bucks for the desktop control module. Technically the card without the module is 119 but it has been on sale for 82 for a long time now., The thumbnail picture used or the product leads you to believe the desktop control module is wireless which wouldnt really make a whole lot of sense anyway but just know you do have to connect the module to the card.Unless you really really want the desktop control module I would get the card without it while its on sale for only 80 bucks.,None,None

The signal was so weak what I mostly got was noise.Now the audio just cooks, some of which may be the result of using a LINE OUT, instead of a headphone (speaker) output.  The audio, after a 20 foot cable, is good enough for me to hear the difference in the DACs!"," This thing... it's a beyoch to get going.  In their control program, there is a tab for speaker selection.  I should have been smart enough to realize that if I selected any speaker configuration, other than ""stereo 2,2"" I would also be selecting the ASIO digital output.  I was not, at first.  If you are not using a surround sound amp with a digital input, you must select ""stereo 2,2"" as your speakers.  That will turn on the analog output from the card and direct it to the jacks (headphone, line out) on the back of your computer.I bet a lot of people send these back because they seem to die, after the first time the user fools around with the control program, and the user can not figure out why...",,None,None

Wrote to Creative, but no answer back yet. Tried Audcity with no better results. Wrote Adobe forum and they recommended getting a USB audio interface. Hmm. Let's see, spend more money to get the recordings I want or get someone to fix this issue? I really love the sound of this card over my ReCon 3D, but... One other issue I found is that when I record the input recording level is weak and I have it maxed and it falls 5 to 6 dBs below the max level. This causes me to amplify the recording, which is not the correct way to record. I had read several reviews of people having driver issues and not being recognized, but I'm not having those issues.

They simply would not RMA the device. When it was new the desktop module did not work out of the box. When the desktop module was connected to a microphone it would randomly squeal much louder than the audio was set to. It was loud enough that I thought it was going to blow my speakers, or the shock was going to give me a heart attack.I contacted them and told them of the issue with the module, and I was told to wait for new drivers that they were working on. I waited and eventually the new drivers were available, but they did not help. About that time Windows 8.1 came out so when I contacted them I was told the card was not compatible with Windows 8.1. All I could think was WOW. However, the sound card worked just fine. They again told me to wait on drivers. It took some time but the drivers came out, and again no change.Funny thing is at the time the sound card drivers worked on 7, 8, and 8.1. They work on 10 as well.During this time I also got the standard try it in another computer, try reloading your operating system, and just about every crazy over the top idea they could come up with to make the issue mine, or to irritate, and frustrate me so I would go away.

DRASTIC improvement over on-board sound. The separate module for volume control and with built in mics is very solid, but the control knob is not as firm as I expected (not a con, just an observation)."," Not a con of the card, but you need to be aware...1. Some SLI capable motherboards are designed to share IRQ channels with the PCIx16 slots. My ZxR was not getting enough resources to run when I had it plugged into PCIe 1-3 on my motherboard. This resulted in wondering sound (channels would drop), cracking, popping, and low volume. I switched to PCIe 4, which shares an IRQ with the SATA channel on my motherboard, and everything works FLAWLESSLY now. 2) Reports of the card not being recognized seem to be related to putting the computer to sleep and then waking it up. I turn my computer off when not using, so I wasn't concerned about this issue. Numerous reports that this is resolved by updating your motherboards BIOS, but you may also want to try a different PCIe socket if you have this problem since IRQ sharing seems to be an issue. Look at your motherboard manual and see what the best configuration is for your setup."," I was floored by the difference this card made over on-board sound for my Sennheiser HD598 headphones. I bought them both at the same time, but the card got delayed in shipping, so I got to test the headphones without the card. I expected an improvement, but not like this. I literally get goosebumps when listening to music. Do yourself (and your ears) a favor, and pair this with a good set of 600ohm headphones. Also, the voice changers are really fun.

ACM was really cool.," Let me start out by saying I loved this card. It worked really well for a few months, but then...One day while I was playing a youtube video my speakers started emitting a TERRIBLE noise. It sounded like shrieking combined with static. Anyway, I muted it, and tried to figure out if I had messed up my speakers somehow and after simply restarting the computer it stopped doing that... for a few days.So when it became much more frequent (doesn't happen all the time, so it's like playing Russian roulette, cringing the whole time), I decided to check the internet, and surprise surprise a lot of people having similar problems with this card. So I did what they said, Uninstalled the drivers, re-installed them, uninstalled ALL parts of my on board audio (which was no easy task) turned off the on board audio in the bios, did everything to remove on board audio except physically rip the chip from my motherboard, tried every single PCI slot, every audio output on the card and every combination possible of the above all while restarting the computer each time (I've troubleshot problems hundreds of times before, I use linux).And trust me, I tested my speakers on everything from cell phones to guitar amps and even when cranked the speakers did not emit that terrible sound (I even played audio on my laptop for 48 hours strait to make sure). Also, before my on board sound stopped working because I disabled it to a non-working state, they worked perfectly on the on board. So it MUST be a problem with the board (hardware or software I can't really tell, but the board is pristine, and hadn't been touched at all between installation and now, other than to clean dust."," I am absolutely fed up with this card taking up so much of my time. I've tried every suggestion made to fix it to no avail. Nobody should have to work around a piece of equipment they paid hundreds of dollars for. I will never buy anything by or related to creative again if I can help it. Now I just have to drop HUNDREDS MORE DOLLARS on a new motherboard (tried everything to get the on board working again) and a new sound card that hopefully actually works and doesn't take up hours of my time.I gave this card a 4 or 5 star shining review when I got it, but it isn't even worth 1 egg now.",2,4

Sound quality it's a huge difference than on board. I used the on board for about a week after my XFI died and couldn't take it anymore. I still feel I liked my XFI sound better but that could just be because I am use to it.," My old XFI ex Platinum died so I got this. Creative seems to be moving away from the break out boxes that have controls that are easily accessible.  That's what I have not upgraded in some time. I saw this one and I saw the knob and figured it was the master volume but turns out it's just for the headphones which was a big disappointment. The surround coming from the speakers sounds kind of echoy like some bad EAX applications, but I haven't really tried to fix that yet so it could just be a setting, but seems as  it should not be default on the card. I also think they are missing lots of audio tweaks and simple things like xfi had. LIke the bass and treble knob in the tray icon was nice, but no longer here.", I think creative should still offer higher end cards maybe one with a LCD breakout box or something a little more to it than just some headphone knob.

The software is very professional and is setup to get the right sound, for whatever you are doing.  I listen to music, video and do gaming, and I have a set of 5.1 Logitech Z5500s.Granted, you do have to tinker with the settings a bit to get the most out of it, but you truly will, it's worth the time.  For instance switching from an HD movie to gaming, I might have to go back in and turn my surrounds up, etc, but I can really get exactly the sound I want UNLIKE stock sound.  I have a good onboard card, its a top Asus board, and I used Optical on my onboard AND on the ZXr so that wasn't a factor.  I don't use headphones much so it was all about getting the best sound out of my speakers.  **If you don't have a good quality set of speakers, this is probably not going to make a huge sound difference but you can still get the surround settings perfect, which I never really could with my onboard like I can with the Soundblaster software.  I can tell a big difference in sound quality, and no it's not perceived, but it's because I am taking the time to tweak everything I watch.  If you are one of those who want to set and forget, this card is not probably for you.**If on the other hand you are willing to spend 1 minute each time you switch from watching a movie, to music, to gaming, then this card will pay off for you if your using decent or above speakers.  Don't expect your $20 speakers to come to life due to a sound card."," Headphone jack.  So it's on this controller now right?  Well my Sennheiser cord that comes out has a Red and Black wire.  I have those going into a headphone splitter as is common.  Well, due to the way they made this controller (with the volume nob), I cannot plug in my headphones, AT ALL.  The stupid plastic around the base keeps my splitter from actually plugging in.  I can't fix that!!!  And there is no way to plug in headphones from the back of the soundcard that i could see (why can't they give us a label to put over this metal, it is SO hard to read like they mark it).  SOOOO, I can't plug in my $150 wireless headphones in because of a stupid design in their base.  So, even if I could plug it in on the back of the card, it now makes this $30 controller for volume WORTHLESS.  So, I rated it 4/5.  This needs to be fixed, did you guys really not try to plug in mainstream headphones into it before mass producing it??", Worth it if you're a gamer with decent speakers and willing to tinker.,1,3

This is a very feature packed card, and for someone who listens to lots of music on a nice stereo as well as records audio for YouTube videos this card surpassed all expectations"," The website where you get the drivers from *unless you use the CD) is ugly and not very easy to navigate. Also the wires for connecting the daughter board are very long, which I understand why it is, but for setups where the cards are very close together it makes the wires bulge either out or in putting some stress on them as well as simply looking bad.

Asus's software doesn't offer very many features and is in a small panel which makes adjusting sliders a pain. I had lots of issues with another Asus product as well and hated dealing with their support, so although I haven't gotten a chance to try the Asus Essence sound card I would easily recommend the Sound Blaster ZxR or Zx to someone looking for high end audio playback and recording, as well as some awesome features for gamers.",2,3

So if you like music that doesn't need watery, over-powering bass then don't get this card. Really don't.

Overall, so pleased and have no complaints, not even the ones some of the reviews include because all of those reviews note things that are totally adjustable to user preference so I don't get the problem there with the complaining.The gaming Recon mode definitely makes a difference too.

N82E16829102049,29-102-049,5/9/2013 11:50:37 PM,Zach S.,Incredible,5," This card just blows on-board sound away. If you truly love good quality sound this is a great card. This card is mainly designed as a gaming card, but it has incredible quality too. The 3D sound is truly amazing. You can hear where there coming from in any direction. It really gives you an edge in shooters and when listening to music."," The sound card is red which doesn't match very many PC, set-ups and so is the control module. The crystalvoice features work, but really ruin the sound of your voice. I have to keep those turned off since my voice sounds super compressed with noise reduction and echo cancellation on.", Overall it was a great buy.

I dictated the only poem I recall, which includes the phrases ""beweep my outcast state"" and ""bootless cries,"" and this sound device rendered it perfectly.  That is a first for me.  Listening to the recordings, there is no discernable electrical noise at all."," This device has only two sound quality settings: 16 bit, 44,100 Hz (CD Quality) and 16 bit, 48,000 Hz (DVD Quality).  If you are planning to don your expensive headphones, kick back, and listen to your Patsy Cline collection for a few hours, you may be sorely disappointed in the sound quality.  The higher speeds available on other sound devices apparently really do make a difference."," I had a hard time setting this device up.  USB 2.0 ports would not recognize it, and it worked fitfully on USB 3.0 ports, dropping out every time the mic was turned off or every time a song changed on VLC Media Player.  Only after I inserted the included USB extension cable into a USB 2.0 port, and attached the adapter to the cable, did it work well.",1,1

Their focus cone was not at all working how it was supposed to- Creative representative clearly stated that music can be ""blaring"" from speakers and it would void the feed. - It voided the feed for a lesser amount of the time, but usually it just goes back into the mic like any other microphone w/ o these supposed features."," I'm sure i'll get excuses as to mic placement and things of that nature but with the all of these supposed noise reduction features along with the rep clearly stating that music can be playing from speakers without the mic picking it up, makes it unacceptable. They shouldn't have made it sound so surefire if it's actually undependable. Conclusion: for the pricerange, you'de be better off buying another product that focuses on sound quality and puts all of the money you spend assurance of that. All of these mic features from what I've experienced are just gimmicks and should in no way factor into a purchase considering how poorly they actually apply.

I run an ASUS Maximus Formula mobo which has SupremeFX onboard audio, I could have gotten away with just using this.However, when you're driving a 5.1 surround setup on your gaming rig it makes a huge difference even from a premium onboard audio solution like the SupremeFX.Very low noise, good theater sound for bluray and MCE usage (with EQ tweaking, bass is a bit much out of the box for my tastes).  In gaming you get crisp and responsive audio regardless of the situation and the Recon mode helps alot more than I thought it would.I like the included controller, it's handy having the headphone inputs exposed on my desk rather than having to run to the back of my rig or trust my case inputs.I find the Zx the sweet spot for myself with the included controller.  If you don't care about the controller then go for the Z it's the same card.  I think the ZxR really should only be considered for folks were they simply must have the flagship product of a series unless you have a great need for audio recording.", While you can easily switch between headphone mode and speaker mode via their control panel I wish the toggle was exposed via a hotkey or right-click context menu.

I think that might be my speakers as they are aging.

Sometimes the drivers would tweak out and I would lose sound in all the speakers which would require a reboot.  I wanted to see if that was my speakers or the card itself so I tested them on the onboard sound card with no issues for a day.  That being said.  It is a very good card.  Some driver features are a bit of a joke (crystalize feature) but overall they are pretty good.  Mics can filter most ambient sound out and the quality is good for not wearing a headset.  I hate headsets so this is a good compromise for me.  Has no problem recording sound from my Korg Krome into ableton and is relatively quick for recording.  Good card when it works.  Give it a shot.

The incorporated stereo microphones are a big plus and you can plug two headphones for comparison purposes.The software installed easy and worked fine without any issues....pretty basic compared to what the previous card had though....oh well.Swappable op-amps is a great feature to adjust the ""voice"" of the card to personal taste."," No Alchemy and no EAX support despite the fact that there are EAX and Alchemy logos on the back of the box. I sent an email to customer support asking about this but I got no answer.The connector cable of the Volume Control Module while very good quality, could have been a bit longer. Its barely enough for me and my PC is close to the KB."," Its very hard to make a decent review for a sound card, there are so many variables in the chain: the recording, the player used, the headphones/speakers, and last but not least our subjective ears and mind perception.For the first few days I used this card I didn't like it very much because I was so used to the way the previous card sounded, and it was a wonderful card indeed.After giving it a couple weeks of heavy testing I love this card, for music listening its a definite improvement.What I noticed is that the good recordings sound better with the ZXR but the average and bad recordings sound worse than the X-Fi. This is particularly noticeable with the AKG 701 headphones. The Sennheiser HD 280 are a lot more forgiving.Its sad that EAX is not supported anymore, it was a great technology. According to Creative themselves EAX is ""deprecated"" but I don't understand how a technology can become obsolete when there is no new technology that can do even remotely what EAX could do.Contrary to what they claim, SBX and Dolby are good for movies but NOT for games.There are motherboards that claim to have top sound qualities including swappable op-amps...cool but don't forget you are paying at least $150 extra for this feature and when its time to change the motherboard....you have to pay again if you want good sound.With a soundcard you just re-use it in your new rig.",2,3

Back in the late 80's and early 90's when I was building computers I would ALWAYS buy a sound card.  There simply wasn't ""on board"" sound back then.  Once the sound started being incorporated into the motherboards, I just went with it to save some money.  With my latest gaming rig however, I've splurged as much as possible to give me the best experience I could afford (which meant a dedicated sound card as a luxury).  WOW!!  I'm hearing things in my games, movies and music that I never heard before!  I have my computers audio being pumped through my home theater receiver with 5.1 surround using floor standing, full range speakers.  Every sound that projects from my system now is SO crisp and clear it's like I'm having an EARGASM!  Footsteps in my games, guitar licks I never noticed, the spacial surround sound that envelops me......these are all new to me thanks to the Sound Blaster Zx!!I did NOT use the installation disk at all.  I went right to Creative's web site and downloaded the latest drivers.  That's all I wanted was the latest drivers.  None of the other ""bloatware"" that usually comes with a new peripheral.  Now I've read some of the other reviews on here and some of the people are complaining about SEVERE LAG when they open the drivers software to make some adjustments.  Perhaps they didn't uninstall and remove previous sound drivers and whatnot.  I want to make it clear that I have NO LAG at all.  Not sure if these other people know how to keep their system clean and clear by preforming routine maintenance such as using Disk Defragmenter, or keeping their system registry clean and in order.The drivers provide an AMAZING amount of adjustments and tweaks to provide you with just the right sound you're looking for.  And these adjustments can be saved as profiles!  You may want your gaming sound profile to be different than your movie or music profile, and Creative will allow you to do just that.  The included stereo microphone on the ACM (Audio Control Module) is a nice bonus that works GREAT!"," For ME and MY system, there isn't a single con to be had."," If you're looking to upgrade from ""on-board"" sound, this is a SOLID choice!

Easy web update.," I purchased this card because I added a 2nd boot drive with Windows 8 and I already had a Sound Blaster X-Fi X-Treme Fidelity card. Although Win 8 provided a driver via Windows Update, the only control I had over settings was bass, treble, stereo or 5.1 channel. It sounded great, but I figured that I would get a new card that officially supported Win 8. It did, however the sound quality was just not there. The reviews for the previous gnerations, the Recon editions, were not good and although this card is an improvement from that card, I put it in the same category as for as sound quality.With my dual boot system and in Windows 7, it was a step back in audio quality. Way less settings control via the included software."," I have been using Sound Blaster since they were ISA cards. Each time I upgraded there was always a noticeable improvement. I remember when the first Audigy cards came out. That was an impressive upgrade especially of the software included. Same thing with the X-Fi cards. I was amazed how they could have improved. In a nut shell, this card does not even measure up to the Audigy which is several generations back.Having said that, if you are moving up from the onboard sound, you will be really impressed. But from a few generations back to this one, it was a disappointment for me. I put my old X-Fi card back in. The PCB layout is almost identical and so I took the shield from the Zx and added it to the X-Fi card.

It sounds real clear and crisp.  Of course with my settings of EQ set to V shape from 24 to the middle 2 0 and the 2nd minus 2 from the sides and crystal 100 and surround 100% or 0%.  With surround with recon3d the bass is gone but with this the surround set to 100% the bass is lessened by pro 5-10% but the quality is better.With my Bose qc20 headphones and this I would say sound out of this setup can be a lot better than hearing it in actual real life.

I don't do much gaming.  So with that caveat in mind, read on.First, this is a nice piece of kit.  The unboxing is a treat, and the hardware looks and feels good.  The action on the volume knob on the external module feels of quality, and the software installation was painless on my Windows 7 x64 machine, and it even keeps itself up to date.  No software problems with a Creative product?  That's got to be a first!The problem is that in back-to-back listening tests versus the onboard sound on my premium motherboard, I couldn't tell a world of difference.  And frankly, if I'm paying $200, I want to be amazed.  My test was performed through a pair of Sennheiser HD595 headphones by playing a song - my usual genre is electronica - and then switching the jack from one source to another and swapping the output device in Windows.  Via this method, I could jump from one device to another with just just a few seconds gap in between.  The result was no noticeable change in clarity.  At best, the Creative card offered richer and more powerful low-midrange tones.  But that's basically paying $200 for a good innate EQ, and that's just not worth it.  Especially since I don't need the 600-ohm headphone amplification.Finally, all of the sound enhancement algorithms - Crystallizer, 'surround sound', and 'bass' - just don't sound that good.The ""Crystallizer"" increases the volume - creating the illusion of improvement - but does add some nice punch to the upper midrange of certain songs. However, it can also sometimes be heard making self-adjustments in the middle of a song, causing the song to sound dynamically uneven.The ""bass"" improvement, meanwhile - this is a separate feature from the equalizer, mind - succeeds only in producing low-end mud in most songs.  Sometimes it works, but only to limited effect.Finally, adjustments made via the *actual* equalizer add undue harshness to the affected frequency bands such that the music begins to sound ""forced"".So the final word on the enhancements is that if you don't like the sound of this card with all the bells and whistles off, then you won't like the sound of this card.In short, I liked it OK.  But I didn't like it enough to think it worth my hard-earned $200.",5,6

Also if you are playing several movies at the same time unless you downgrade the sound quality from 24bit 96k to 16bit 44k you have a good chance it will lock up.Windows 8.1: The sound card no longer gets lost on boot up but I sometimes have to select the card when I double click on the sound blaster icon panel and even then several of the options (at times) will vanish from the left hand menu. The only way for me to fix this is to turn the PC off and count to 5 and then turn it back on. The stress test with multiple movies problem is still present under Windows 8.1," Like I said it is probably the best card on the market. I tried an ASUS ROG soundcard and unfortunately it is not being supported at all by ASUS. That card is suppose to be the Creative ZxR in every respect but because of poor driver support it failed which brought me to the ZxR.One good note, there is no more BLOATWARE in the software package which was extensive under the X-Fi series of sound cards by Creative which is plus.",1,1

No more DPC latency issue."," THE MUSIC QUALITY SUCKS.I use the word ""suck"" as a relative term. It was nowhere near as crisp and clear and accurate and beautiful as my 6-year old Titanium card.

(i personally use pro-gamer setting)."," Heaphone surround mode is a *little* tinny sounding, BUT it is minimized when change the ""room size"" to a smaller room. I just do not use the function, but I did in the past and just grew accustomed to the tinniness."," All of these ""tech knowledge - 5"" newbs writing these 1-egg reviews are full of tripe. They likely have never worked in the PC field and are self-titled 5s because they ""built their own PC that 1 time."" I'm not just an enthusiast; I have actually worked as a PC sales and repair technician and have done so as a hobby on the side for years.Drivers install fine, and do not use a downloader or 3rd party app.When the device is properly installed, with nothing on/in the PC interfering with it, is mysteriously works PERFECTLY and sounds amazing.TBH, giving 1 egg due to lack of tech knowledge is almost as bad as voting 1 egg for a DOA.

It even worked without drivers on my asus sabertooth board, but needed the drivers to go to 5.1.This is the first time I have purchased a dedicated sound card and what a difference. To the people who said there is no notacible increase over integrated sound, do yourself a favour and get some good headphones and switch the sound channels from 2 to 8 with the asus software, otherwise no, you will not get better quality with just 2 channel output. Also it may be a 5.1 card, but you can enable ""virtual 7.1"", which is a nice touch for people who like to edit speaker placement and volume for that perfect surround sound.Also if you use headphones the built in headphone amp is a must have, and it has 3 different settings so it will match your headphone resistance. It switches easily from front to back outputs using the software (although some people seem to not like it, it gets the job done and isn't a memory hog.)"," I had to bend the bracket to get it to screw in properly. I know many people have even gone so far as to RMA the card for this reason, but a little straigtining and I can get it to fit anywhere, and I have put this on different MoBo's and different cases."," Remember that PCI-E can fit in a PCI slot if your VGA covers up your only PCI-E slot, like on my sabertooth 990.I kinda wish I had seen the PCI verson and saved myself some money, but this card is more adaptable to any build.My other gaming friends still think the onboard sound card is fine.

I can say that after solving the problem this card is FANTASTIC.  Running Win 7 Ultimate and the drivers are fine.  The software is fine, the sound is fantastic.  It's everything I wanted for my 2004 X-fi Music card I've been using on every computer build.  You've got real RCA ports to run directly to your speakers.  It's got Optical connectors build into the RCA plugs if you are running TOSLINK.  Sound is crisp and clear on my speakers.  I'm running MAudio 4.0 monitors and you can hear every last detail in the music.  Full range, full volume, perfectly clear.  This card will also work with the X-Fi expansion port so you can have your connectors up front with separate volume controls for mic and headphones."," There was  a problem with sound cut out.  Creative tech recommended moving the card into another slot.  What I had forgotten was that I hooked up my PC Case HDAUDIO front ports connector for headphones and mic.  This was the problem that was causing sound to cut out.  The card doesn't detect if you have headphones plugged in our not.  By attaching the cable the card assumed they were always plugged in.  So, removing the cable returned all sound."," If you want a solid card running on PCIe bus with a proven track record for the chip set, get this card.  You'll be using it for the next 10 years or longer, unless the PCIe ports suddenly go away.   Very happy with this card.  It's a winner.",6,6

Teaches valuable life lessons about being too quick to forgive.," I purchased this specifically to use with my surround sound speakers and my surround sound headphones.  I have an old JVC receiver I've been using for a decade now and a brand spankin' new set of Tritton Pro+ Headphones. Both worked perfect with full surround using my previous soundcard.After enabling Dolby Live in the Creative software Everything worked fine for about 2 minutes. then I noticed some oddities in a movie I was testing with and ran a Dolby Test DVD I have.The center channel was coming out of the left rear speaker. The sub-woofer channel was coming out of the right front speaker. The right rear channel was coming out of the sub-woofer.  I ran the test again without making any changes and got an entirely different result... but still not the correct one. No I'm not making this up.Over the past hour I've repeatedly run this test, uninstalled, reinstalled, rebooted, changed settings, researched online, etc. During that time I think I've gotten every possible combination of channels coming out of the wrong speakers. I've even gotten the right one a time or two.I am not in the process of seeking a refund from Newegg."," I should have known better.This will be the third product in a row from Creative that I've been burned on. The first was a Creative Sound Blaster Audigy zs2 or something like that... about 10 years ago. The problem I had with it was common and unsolvable. Creative never did acknowledge the problem despite literally thousands of users complaining on their forums.I think bought the X-Fi Fatality! thinking ""surely this completely new design will not have the same problems."" Exactly same problem. Exact same unwillingness to admit to it. I suppose I should count myself fortunate that the ZxR has a complete new problem.

Open your case, plug it into any available PCIe slot, connect the front-panel cable header (if your case is so equipped,) close case, boot, install drivers and voila, sound! OK, there are a few minor steps omitted, but that is the gist of it.Provides good, clear sound at a very affordable price, especially if you can score one on sale, or less preferably, with MIR. I do hate MIRs, though.Should lighten the load on system resources by disabling integrated motherboard audio, but any sound card will provide this benefit.Appears to be well made with good-quality PCB and components.Windows utility provides a multitude of settings and options to help tailor your sound to whatever preferences you may desire.Well-packaged, should survive all but the most brutal handling during transport."," Honestly, I cannot discern any real difference between this card and the integrated motherboard audio. This could be due to less-than-excellent speakers/headphone, but the fact remains, nonetheless.The Windows utility is functional enough, but rather vague and confusing regarding all the various options and settings. There is no real built-in help, you must reference the manual or online PDF for clarification on a great deal of settings. Even then, the distinctions between some of the settings remains fuzzy and you're uncertain which might be best for different scenarios.Mail-In-Rebate (at this time.) I despise MIRs (although I always redeem them,) I would rather have the choice of getting 1/2 the MIR amount off of the purchase price than go through the rebate hassles for the full amount."," I was forced to purchase a sound card since the rear-panel jacks on my motherboard inexplicably quit working one day. The front-panel ports still worked just fine, only the rear panel was affected -- and I didn't want to stare at an audio cable perpetually snaking out the front and back to my speakers -- so I opted to disable the onboard audio and go this route.Mind you, I haven't owned a dedicated sound card in years, actually, more like decades, instead settling for the integrated motherboard audio, which has consistently gotten better over time.This is a fine sound card for my needs, I do quite a bit of gaming but don't need audiophile quality for that. I wish I could say the sound from this dedicated peripheral blows away that of the integrated audio, but I simply cannot clearly tell one from the other.I still hate MIRs.My simplest advice: If you need a dedicated audio card, this should do the trick. If you can rely on your (functional) integrated audio, you probably won't be missing anything.",1,1

I see all of these issues people seem to have now and I haven't had any of these software, code 10, or quality issues.I went from an excellent xonar essence stx with aftermarket OPAMPS (started to generate feedback and pickup cellphone activity in the left channel) to this ZXR. This ZXR isn't only far more customizable than the essence STX, it doesn't produce an overbearing tones at higher volumes. I swapped my aftermarket OPAMPS from the xonar into this zxr and it sounds more atmospheric while keeping incredible accuracy. (I don't loose the vocals in songs but I can hear more instrumentals)  I also read about people complaining it's too 'bassy and juvenile', that is absolutely true when the SBX studio is enabled - and honestly, sometimes I like some additional bass in my beats, however, when it's turned off, there is no software scrubbing the sound, and the hardware is the only thing processing the sound - this card is aimed at sound reproduction at heart."," The price decided to plummet 100$ out of nowhere.Also keep in mind; this card runs very hot even when not being used, this is what is probably attributing to others having short life spans of these cards. Sometimes you have to move some air to keep your stuff working."," I pair this card with Sennheiser HD650 cans, I wouldn't have it any other way. I also have the option to record some insane audio if I ever choose to. (I won't, but I can).When I'm alone I have a pair of gigaworks 2.1 speakers I blast. It sounds great... that's all I can say.

Great all-around card with excellent specs and excellent support, nice volume knob that is all analog and immune from Flash video *displeasure remark censored* that prevents you from lowering volume during commercials, or any other time actually."," Not enough power to drive headphones at high bass levels, especially  with less efficient headphones, likely due to the lack of external power for this card(these cards).  Quick bumps are very clear, but longer bass sequences get muddy.Since the volume knob is analog it cannot control the other outputs, only what's connected to the ACM.  I find myself going back to the digital audio volume controls because reducing volume at the knob does not cut down distortion from over-driving bass, just the volume, so the amps are still driving full power.  It is an attenuation knob, not a power knob."," I am not a bass-head, but I do like bass to be pronounced and tight.  I use Sennheiser HD598 and they are more subtle, certainly not bassy.  There is a great deal of gain capable with this card for the equalizer as well as total power delivered to headphones.  I even hooked up my old Sony MDR-V600's and they sounded bad, tinny.  I had the sony's plugged into my receiver and bouncing off my head, the Creative ZxR lacks the power for that, but the Sennheiser's have much more bass even though they are not bassy headphones, just much more efficient across the board.  Default settings do increase bass, as well as highs in the SBX Pro Studio options, but that depends on your transducers and listening environment as well.",3,3

Overall great for everything--music production, video/audio streaming, and gaming. Rear ports appear to be gold-plated, and has a internal connector for front panel HD Audio (if your case supports it). It fits in any type of PCIe slot, I currently have it in a PCIe 4x slot and it works just fine. This sound card DOES NOT require power from the PSU, which was a big plus for my build.Download the latest driver from Creative.com, includes several modes and customizations including 3-D surround virtualization, sound crystalizer, speaker, smart volume, dialog plus, EAX effects, etc. Sound equalizer is important to adjust to get the best quality sound depending on the type of music you use--that's how amazing this sound card is!Rear ports support Stereo speakers and/or headphones (3.5mm), microphone (3.5mm), stereo optical in and out ports (which light up), and the standard audio left and right (red/white) jacks. Driver software supports hooking the card up to an audio receiver that outputs 5.1 and 7.1 stereo using optical cables, though I have not personally been able to try this yet.I also read somewhere that it allows for customizable OP-amp chips which I have not had the chance to play with but is definitely a plus for those out there who want the right type of sound."," I had two minor issues with this product. First of all, I did not get this product for the price it is listed at, and I would not buy this product for its listed price here. If you have extra money lying around and would like to invest in a PCIe sound card for your PC, this is definitely something to consider... but is completely unnecessary.My other issue was: I installed this in my new PC (specs listed in Other Thoughts) and there was a constant clicking/popping sound in the audio stream. I troubleshooted the problem for a week or two until I finally found a fix. It was due to a high DPC Latency in my PC, caused by a driver for a networks adapter running at a slow speed.IF YOU HAVE THIS PRODUCT AND EXPERIENCE POPPING/CRACKLING SOUNDS: I highly suggest you do research on Google about DPC Latency. It solved the issue for me.Other common issues (that I don't really have problems with):--The sound card was NOT designed with standard PC stereo speakers in mind. Although they DO indeed work in the rear headphone port (at a good quality, might I add), the driver software will not detect them as desktop speakers, and you may have to do some adjustments to get that speaker sound.--It's quite a big card for a PCIe slot, and it does take up a significant amount of space.

I personally didn't need the second (aka daughter card) but it comes as a package deal.  But for audio philes, they will love the 2nd card."," My old SoundBlaster X-Fi Titanium sound card was doing just fine but because I upgraded from Logitech ClearChat Pro Wireless-USB headsets/mic to Sennheiser PC 350 Special Edition High Performance Gaming Headset, then a sound card with AMP was needed as my Senns are rated 150 ohm impedance.The sound cards (2 of them which surprised at first) along with a well designed ACM (Audio Control Module) makes it a well-built plug-n-play setup that allows me to have both my PC speakers (2.1 w/sub-woofer) and my headset always plugged in. I just switch from one output device via the software module (PC speakers <---> Headset). Some people complain about not having a physical switch to do the switching but to me it's no big deal.The secondary (aka daughter card) is for plugging into an AVR (audio-video receiver or plugging in an external device such as an iPod). It's not necessary for me, but it is part of the package and has the audio equivalent of an SLI bridge to connect both cards. But to remind people the 2nd card does NOT plug into any slot as it is just a board with no connection to the motherboard. Only inputs/outputs to other devices and the connection wired bridge to the main sound mothercard.

In ASIO mode, the card worked seamlessly with Sonar, but not in WDM mode. I couldn't work out the conflict, so I returned the card.Another significant con was that if the headphone jack is plugged in, the speakers are muted -- and there is no way to configure (by software properties settings) simultaneous output from headphones and analog speakers.

This happens far too often and was never the case on my onboard audio., This is a follow up on a review I wrote a few days ago.  I was wrong about the asio.  it ONLY SUPPORTS asio out as triples has already stated.  this has been verified by creative tech support themselves.  however as I stated in my last review this card does somehow seem to bypass WAVE RT (not to be confused with WAVE) even though it is not is ASIO.  my DAW software says my latency should be 20ms but this card is low enough latency that if settings are correct I can actually record in WAVE RT.  I don't understand why this is the case for me but it is.  This card is one very expensive gaming card.  forget this card for DAW.  hard lesson learned for me and returning it would cost as much as a mid range card.  The sound out is nice so I am probably keeping this card with a lot of regret.  I was actually able to get this card to record via ASIO in windows 7 through tremendous work but it sounded worse than WAVE (Not WAVE RT) @ 1 ms.  It just hurt.  Creative labs bottlenecked their own product before it ever left the factory with this card.  Frustrating.  this card is not for recording despite what they advertise it as.

Supposedly there is a pre-amp for the microphone - this is either a flat-out lie or a poorly implemented solution. You have to scream to be heard. - Driver defaults microphone input to front panel, which can cause confusion (look at other reviews here). This is particularly stupid since most people will be using headsets with this card and since the front-panel headphone is not amplified, they will be plugging their headsets into the rear.

If this sound card sounds slightly better than the lowest-end onboard sound, and the microphone input is worse (unusable!), I can't think of a price point in which I would buy this card.

I love the idea of swappable on board op amps, and even then the included TPA6120s sound good enough that you may not even want to switch them. Grounding and shielding on the card is fantastic, I had to rearrange my card set up to install this new unit and unfortunately had to place it directly next to another piece of hardware that caused massive noise on my old sound card when I tried the same. Absolutely no hiss, noise, or distortion on this one in the same situation.I've been using mainly a set of HD600s and  MTH-50s, and I've noticed punchier and more precise bass, and much cleaner and less distorted highs. I'm not thrilled with the fact I basically HAVE to use digital to connect to my 5.1 system, but the abysmal digital support from the previous generations seems to be a thing of the past. I had no issues using the supplied optical cable to connect, and switching between headphones and 5.1 in the control panel is easy and convenient. The desk piece is decent enough, although the mic is not all that great as one might expect. I do like the fact it has both 1/8"" and 1/4"" inputs, but I really miss my old front box with the rest of the input/outputs.SBX Studio versions of Surround and Crystalizer seem to just sound better then their predecessors, and the way it colors bass is super satisfying. Recon mode is an interesting idea, and you can definitely tell were people are at in games easier, but in my opinion it sounds way too unnatural for me to still enjoy the experience. Finally, the idea of having a second board with a second core just for recording is a great idea that I love. Sadly it doesn't seem I'll ever find out how great it could be because..."," Atrocious ASIO support. The other Z series didn't even ship with ASIO support AT ALL. This one has support out of the box (the others can get support from a driver update), but IT IS ONLY FOR PLAYBACK. THERE IS NO ASIO INPUT SUPPORT. This is absolutely stupefying to me; why would you include an entire second card, complete with high quality phono inputs, and then force the user to use Directsound to record? None of the recordings I have made so far, from multiple sources and at one point even through an outboard rack mixer, sound remotely as good as on my old sound card with ASIO support. ASIO4ALL doesn't help as the input it provides is of a lower sample rate then the regular DirectSound input for some reason. Outside of just recording quality, another thing I loved about my X-Fi was the fact that with Guitar Rig and the ASIO support I could just plug my guitar in the front box and go if I didn't feel like hauling the rest of my equipment out. No can do with this card, and again ASIO4ALL does not help as it adds a half second or so delay, making it very hard to play naturally.Creative support either seems to have no idea what the company itself is making for the card, or Creative actually does not intend to fix this massive (for some) problem, as there is zero indication on their website or through my support contacts that has any hint of full ASIO support being added at a later date. Truly disappointed with this. Full ASIO support has been a part of Sound Blaster flagship cards since the Audigy 2. I have no idea why they've chosen to dump this starting with the Recon3D and Z series."," I was bouncing between 3 and 4 stars for my rating, and I decided on 4 as if this card had better ASIO support it would have easily gotten 5 stars and I realize ASIO support issues are not relevant to all users.Only bought this because my old X-Fi Fata1ty finally gave up the ghost after a long six years of service. It sounded good for what it was, especially with an outboard headphone amp, and I loved the front box with MIDI, phono, and 1/4"" ins, something which I don't think we'll see again. That and the apparent lack of proper ASIO support makes me want to toss this and go find an old X-Fi to put in and hold on for dear life.",13,14

Software works first time every time, unlike the X-Fi software/drivers. The ACM is nice and feels solidly built."," It's advertised to put out 80mW of power for headphones, doesn't even put out 50mW.

Now not putting the 100mW out for my headphones is my fault for not reading, it's the not getting even 80mW that's the problem. Drivers/Software can be problematic when moving the card to a different slot. Doesn't properly recognize the card, software won't work, etc. If it's in the slot it was in when the drivers were installed there's no problems. Beamforming mic with the settings doesn't seem to do hardly anything other than make it harder for people to hear you (at least in Skype). Friends could barely hear me, said I sounded like I was far away, turning off more of the settings allowed them to hear me better (and also everything else unfortunately)."," At first I had a buyers remorse and was wanting to return it or sell it to someone else. Thinking it'd properly power my headphones only to not be able to was a downer, however it turned out to be partially my error and partially Creative's for false advertising. The beamforming mic features are a bit of a downer, was hoping I'd be able to use my speakers occasionally while in Skype instead of my headphones all the time. Oh well no real loss. I'm giving it 3 eggs because of the card not being able to put out the advertised 80mW for headphones, Creative saying it'll power any headphones out there (It can't obviously), and the beamforming mic not working like it's advertised (barely an issue however).",8,9

At 0 system volume I can still clearly hear sound even when I obviously shouldn't, and with any half decent set of headphones/earbuds there is this obnoxious hissing sound that drives me nuts. The impedance setup for my mobo also made it that my headphones were basically at full volume only 25% of the way up which meant tweaking the sound was very sensitive and often I couldn't find a 'sweet spot' when I just wanted to have the volume low.I ordered this card in hopes that it would solve these issues and it does so perfectly.

The sound is great I tested it on my Turtle Beach Ear force Z2 headset and it sounds sooo much better than my old integrated. One problem I had was when I first installed it I installed the Uni Xonar c media control panel drivers and if you do that you wont get sound coming through the front panel unless you change some settings. So I reinstalled it using the Asus Control Panel and it worked perfectly. When you first do it the front panel will come through with weak sound but you need to set the HD Advance setting to pro gaming mode.  The defualt Asus drivers kinda sucks but its all good.

It's not that loud, and barely noticeable anymore though. Also I did have one problem from the first time I tried it. When I hooked up my speakers and tried some music, the left speaker wouldn't put out any sound.

I installed the card with ease, and downloaded the drivers. I was excited to get back to gaming with sound again (I do not have speakers, just a headset). I got on League of Legends, and right away something was different. I would hear game sounds perfectly fine for about 5 seconds. Then, SOME sounds would just go out (completely muted) for another 5 seconds. It was very irritating. I opened the Xonar DGX Audio Center and modified some settings, which fixed the problem a little bit. It still happened, but not as often as before. I took my headset and plugged it into my laptop and played League of Legends to see if it was just a problem with my headset, but it wasn't. The sound was perfectly fine on my laptop. I just decided to deal with it for a while, thinking the problem might go away on its own. **The problem got worse and worse as the days passed, and when I tried to tweak my settings again today, my microphone completely stopped working.

The SNR is extremely high and it sure sounds like all of those high-end features and numbers that are endlessly bragged about in the details are really there.  The THX TruStudio PC thingy is a useful feature and really adds to my whole music and movie experience.   Headphone output directly from the card sounds crisp and clear.  EAX effects are nice and when applying any environmental effects in entertainment mode (like Theater or Opera Hall) the effect isn’t overdone like it was on my on-board sound card.  I like how customizable this card is, from both the software and hardware stand point.  Its nice that Creative gave me all of these options to change how I playback my sound and get it just right.  The sound card itself looks fantastic; its low-key look disguises how powerful it really is.  It makes it look intimidating.Music, movies, and games sound absolutely fantastic with this card."," Hardware wise, its sold.  Software wise, its a different story thanks to a few odd things here and there.During instillation the Creative Console Launcher (which is fairly important) had instillation errors and said it failed to install, but when I rebooted its installed and working fine.  lolwut?Two days after, it had somehow switched over to the unused (for now) SPDIF output and stopped using the Speaker output.  I just went into Windows' Sound panel and switched the default output device.  Whatever.Then the lovely entertainment mode (which has the THX settings and such) of the Console Launcher started acting real wired and some of the feature buttons disappeared.  Furthermore when I went to change the speaker settings it would crash it outright.  Can't recall how I fixed it though. :\Its been running fine since then and I simply used drivers from the disk.  Although I would recommend installing the beta drivers."," Overall this card is really, really nice and a fine piece of audiophile quality equipment.My attachment to Creative cards is like my attachment to Alfa-Romeos or Lancias; yes they have problems, yes there are better cars out there, but they don't have the same soul, passion, or history as the others, but there may come a day when I go with a competitor when I’ve had enough of the random issues.I am more than happy with my purchase; I’m just disappointed that the software issues aren’t completely gone.

The front header connector doesn't amplify.  This is a major oversight unless it just wasn't technically feasible.  Also this and proper headphone settings aren't documented anywhere in the box or the software.

I have a pair of cheaper studio monitors, which are pretty good, but I assume if you're looking at this card you're going to have decent speakers.  I personally like the EAX effects, I don't always use them but for some tracks I turn on stone hall or another one of the effects.  I really like the Crystalizer, in the THX truestudio PC options.  I personally feel it makes a track much more ""vibrant"".  To me it makes the sound more real, like I was in the studio with the artists.  There are many features on the card, but honestly I have only used those two.  I don't really use the equalizer, encoder, microphone effects, etc."," IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH AUDIO FROM STREAMING VIDEO OR AUDIO LOOK HERE.   I have a wireless PCI internet card.  It has two antennas.  If I have these pointed upright it interferes directly with the sound card, probably with the cables.  I have to have the antennas pointed directly out the back of the desktop.  I also have had to tie down all the other cables going to my PC, monitor, mouse, keyboard, power, etc, and keep those away from the RCA to TRS cable I use for the studio monitors.  I also have tied the power cables for the monitors and kept those away, not sure if that was part of eliminating the noise but I did it anyways. This is PARAMOUNT to hearing the best quality sound with no noise.  If you have the antennas interfering, when you stream video your are downloading, and that action creates noise in the speakers.  Fix your cables, and you will likely solve your problem.  Also pretty expensive at retail price anyways.  Got it on sale locally."," I have this sound card plugged into a pair of M-Audio BX5a speakers.  These speakers are powered, so they each have their own power cord that goes to the power strip.

9SIA4RE4VP4156,29-102-033,8/15/2011 8:35:23 AM,Monte C.,Update,4, This is probably the most solid Creative product in years.  They actually wrote new software and made it work.  The quality of the build material and the headphone amp is great and this card is very good for recording.  This can have very powerful bass and the mids and highs are good.  I think it is a bit more laid back sounding than the also popular oxygen chips (HT Omega and Asus).  Good for gaming with EAX titles.," Thankfully not the drivers.  However, the software that accompanies is not great.  For me the THX section of the movie setting would make the sound distorted and cause some vocal anomolies (vibration/distortion)  Turning it off is fine, but then the sound is relatively low.  Audio creation had low volume.  Game mode was where it is at.  It works well and has all the setting close together.  However, there are still no easy settings to switch between analog and digital and this card only supports 5.1.  I do not appreciate CMSS as an alternative to Dolby Digital.  It works, but to my ears is not as good.  Also the fact that you cannot have a headset plugged in and turn it off or on, but must unplug the headset is just unforgivable and typical Creative (actually lack of creativity.)  Not sure EAX is a meaningful pro anymore for gaming.", So now that I have the card for some time I can say the sound quality when set up well is very good.  I would even say I like the X-Fi sound stage a little better than the oxygen stage as it is slightly warmer.  But I cannot keep using the card and took it out of my system because it just is too much work to get working properly between different modes and has some distortion at times.  The software is bulky and slow and quite frankly needlessly so.,5,5

The simplified review is to say they are seeing excellent definition from my PC for the first time. The nuances that were always missing are suddenly not only present but up front and center. Just Wowed is far too simple but it is simply the best I can do. My best Sure’s agree with this assessment. The only drawback I could point out is if you want ‘big’ volume or huge bass on headphones you will likely an external amp.Testing different op amps feeding my other cans will be the final verdict but the reality is toying the back end will have a similar effect regardless. Clearly the front processing portion is done very right in this card. Buy? If you have never heard the click of the pseudo symbols in Jimmy Eat Worlds Sundown between 4:43 and 5:00... what else are you missing?, May need an external amp if you like it 'loud'., This card added more to my machine than the latest greatest video card.

I was considering two other top sound cards w/headphone amp from A and HT before; and then, I saw this card on sale.  I like the PCIe – with my new system, the newer slot will also be “future proof.”  So far – this sound card has nice sounds big improvement from my on-board sound – just look at all the previous glowing reviews.  Here, I’ll just point out some of my own observations.  +Creative card / software is pretty easy to install and work with  +Good update support – no problems w/win7 64bit – no pop or skipping.  +Thumping sound for music and games – it sounds even better since added external amp. +This card is generally sells less than the other cards, but with comparable and or superior qualities.", -headphone amp pretty good but don’t expect it to kill any other more expensive external headphone amps.  -Low volume in movies (w/Dolby Digital – like DVD; BD; Netflix) volume is lower than expected close to 90 - 100% volume is not that loud – compared to music – listen at 45%.  (Not a big deal since I use external amp)-No EMI shielding - very good and silent sound card – except when I turn it up playing games and I can hear the “PC noises” mostly during SSD activity. -Case headphone port connected to this card is very noisy -No digital coaxial out – some hi-fi sound better with coaxial then with optical –but otherwise the RCAs are fine output -Non-standard optical port – don’t lose your wire.," Over all, the sound is pretty good for an audio device than cost less than two hundred.

There is no way to do this in software from the control panel.If you are like me and switch between headphones and speakers every few minutes, this means bending down under your desk to remove the headphone plug or stick it back in again, depending on whether you want to use headphones or speakers.I have a silverstone Raven case with a lid ontop of my expansion ports and I am concerned this constant removal and replacement of the lid is going to lead to damage of the lid, or the 3.5mm jack eventually.Creative states this was an intentional design decision and can not be fixed via software updates.This is absolutely insane.

9SIA4RE4VP4156,29-102-033,7/28/2011 7:49:30 AM,Mike S.,Great Value,5," This is my third Creative Sound Blasters card and I have to say Creative Labs finally got the whole package right.  Having the X-FI Titanium and the Fatality gaming edition, this card is a major step up.  Build quality of the physical card is truly amazing for the price point.  The drivers have been refined for win7 and now include the DDL/DTS and other features built in.  For once, I had absolutely no issues with drivers (to be fair, this is my 3rd card so I know Creative’s software like the back of my hand).  For anyone that has not had an add-on sound card, you WILL without a doubt hear the difference the moment you start up your favorite audio source.  Sound quality is of course up there with the best consumer cards you can buy today."," The only con (although not a big one) I could really find is the software is slow or laggy. Doesn’t matter how good your PC is, it will still be slow.  But in the end if you just install the driver and Console Launcher, you will be very satisfied with this product.   Don’t bother with the extra software (unless you need it), because it’s just that, extra software. I recommend anyone purchasing this card to really play around with the settings and get to know them.    To be safe, make sure you close all programs before changing an option as to not disrupt the audio source.  The software will warn you this as well."," I was debating this card or the top offerings from other companies.   In the past I have had major driver issues with Creative cards, but it seems they have finally cleaned up most of my concerns.  I am very happy I decided to go with Creative once again.  I threw this in my HTPC box I use for HD movies/TV, music and mid-level gaming.  I have found Entertainment mode works best for everything.

Many people say that if you want great sound from a card for music, you need to go with the higher end ASUS cards. I don't really think this is true after having heard this card. I popped it into a PCIe16X slot, and, after getting rid of my old drivers and getting the newest from the Creative site, I got aural bliss. This is the first card I have ever needed to turn DOWN the bass and treble on! I started with some FLAC files and was floored. I went onto some games, and was again, floored. MP3's under 320kbps will show their limitations for sure, so you might just need a bigger HD for all the lossless stuff you'll be replacing them with!This is a real step up for Creative, and I would not hesitate to suggest it to ANYONE who wants quality sound from their PC.", None that I can think of. Drivers work great and instillation is a breeze.," Do yourself a favor and get a high end card. You might not think it will make a huge difference, but it does. The drivers have improved tremendously since the earlier X-Fi days, and these drivers were written from the ground up to take advantage of W7.",6,6
9SIA4RE4VP4156,29-102-033,7/12/2011 11:09:54 AM,Zachary P.,Nice Card,4," I bought this card so that I could connect my home theater PC audio to my home theater receiver with just an optical audio cable (as can be done with gaming consoles such as the Xbox 360 and PS3). To that end, mission accomplished. I get digital surround sound from my home theater PC through my 5.1 home theater audio system. Excellent. The card was a great deal through Newegg's daily Shell Shocker and provides much better, clearer and more powerful audio than my onboard audio could ever dream. My games sound great through this card."," The software that drives this card is a bit of a pain. While the card can (and does) take audio signals from sources such as games and encodes them to a digital signal (such as Dolby Digital 5.1), I had to dig through the software options to enable the functionality. Further, the software is laggy and takes a while to respond to changes (you click on a setting, it chugs for a few seconds until it finally complies). Also, I dislike that Creative went with the multi-use connector for the optical out. The connector does have the capability to accept an RCA cable or an optical cable, but the RCA capability forces the use of a mini optical cable or adapter to get the optical functionality. Those cable have become fairly uncommon and somewhat difficult to find (at retail stores, anyway)."," If you plan on connecting this card to your home theater PC, you may want to pick up some mini optical to standard optical adapters as the cables that come with the card are only about 4 ft long. Also, don't expect to just install the card and have it outputting digital sound through the optical out. That function must be enabled through the software, which really isn't a big deal. Once it's all set up, though, the card is great other than it's laggy software.",3,5

The card manages to stand with the bigger cards out there that have built in amps in terms of sound quality when paired with mid range headphones."," I'm not sure if it's caused by the infamous driver software or the hardware itself but during gaming sessions, I get popping and crackling - it's almost rhythmic.  The crackling goes away after a minute or two but with a newer game such as The Witcher 2, it just won't.  I've performed a clean install a few times using Driver Sweeper but met the same result every time."," After three months of dealing with this issue, I'm looking to sell this card.  I'm eyeing an Asus card as I use headphones and not surround sound speakers.  Essence STX or even the Xense combo is looking mighty tempting.  If that works out, I'll never go back to Creative Labs.  In addition, I've had experience using the Auzentech Forte which is also powered by an X-Fi chip.  I've had problems with that card as well related to grounding issues.  I think it was a foreshadowing of problems I was destined to have with the Titanium HD.",3,5
9SIA4RE4VP4156,29-102-033,5/24/2011 11:51:43 PM,H I.,Unsatisfied,1, My biggest complaint with the card is that it can’t send DTS Connect or Dolby Digital Live streams over SPDIF. You have to reconfigure its audio properties so that it outputs to ‘Speakers’ Mode. The problem is that by doing that it prevents programs like Windows Media Center and VLC from playing native DD or DTS tracks over SPDIF. Instead you’ll hear 90’s analog Dolby Surround up-sampled to DTS Connect or DD Live and this doesn’t sound as good as the native digital audio stream.You can however change back to ‘SPDIF’ Mode at anytime but this requires rebooting your computer. I frequently watch TV and Blu-rays on my computer and this is unacceptable., PC Gaming with non EAX software sounds just as bad. The problem is EAX isn’t on most software titles. So for most PC games you’ll also be hearing up-sampled 90’s quality Dolby Surround. This means you’ll be missing true speaker separation and that defeats the purpose of even having a multi-channel setup. What you expect to hear from your left channel rear speaker will also be coming out of your left channel front., I bought this card expecting to marriage the superior audio capabilities of an Xbox 360 with the graphic fidelity of a PC and this card disappointed. It’s unfair that Creative has monopolized the PC Audio landscape for decades and all we have to show for it is hap hazard digital audio implementation and a small handful of PC games that support HD audio. If Microsoft was paying any attention they could easily revitalize the PC Audio Market. Instead we’re left with lack luster products from all hardware vendors. ASUS and Turtle Beach are forced to follow in Creative’s dismal wake. Is anyone in Redmond paying attention?,11,17

(See Other Thoughts)," -General Review-This card works fantastically! I have it installed in the slot next to my GTX 660 and it is small enough that it is completely out of the way of the intake fan on the Graphics Card. The adapter to use an optical TOSLINK cable is included, which is very helpful. I tested the optical capabilities on my home theater setup and it works perfectly.-FP Mic Problem Info-There is a problem with the front panel mic port. When monitoring is enabled you can hear yourself and Windows sound settings also displays the green audio level bars. But when using an application such as Skype or games with VoiP they do not register any input. However, The Mic port on the card works just fine. This leads me to believe it's a problem with drivers and Windows 8. This is particularly annoying because If I want to use my headset and mic I have to get behind my computer and switch out the plugs with my speakers.-Automatic Switching Problem InfoWhen you plug headphones into the front panel connector it will automatically switch to front panel headphone mode. When you unplug them it will automatically switch back to the on-board port, but it will remain in headphone mode instead of switching back to the speaker mode. You have to manually change the setting back to speakers. This is most noticeable if you have a 5.1 or 7.1 setup since you will be getting audio out of only 2 speakers if you don't change it back.",1,1

Windows 8/my Asus motherboard wouldn't recognize the card no matter what I tried.   After a few hours of googling and seeing tons of other people having this issue I followed instructions where I ended up fixing it by loading a USB drive with an old HP 'dos' program then manually configured it so it would be recognized.  After the drivers were installed, which left a lot of be desired for as far as getting more sound from a high quality pair of headphones.  The entire time I kept looking and hoping I could do more to change the ranges, but oh well, drivers and software are underwhelming.   If that was the only issue, fine.  Less than 2 days into owning the card all of a sudden a terrible static and popping started occurring.  i changed out my headphones, the cabling, I even re-seated the card into a new slot.

But after installing the LME49720HA single opamp module,  I much prefer that sound!  I owe my original dislike to it as the the treble was scratchy.  BUT!  The opamp I received was damaged in transit, its wires bent 90 degrees.  After I cut them,  I had to bend the wires much more than I usually do.  Bent wires increases the work stress on the metal,  lowering the electrical conductance.  When I had a unbent unit installed, the sound and treble was much smoother and easier on the ear.  I soldered that one and it got ruined! Now I just use a twisty tie to hold the opamp to the circuit board,  and solder only the inner DIP8 pins.  Opamps are a personal choice,  and you can go crazy trying different ones.   The lme49710ha's and 20's were the first ones everyone raved about in 2008.  I like them,  they give a nice old School Panasonic Ambience sound to my ear.  They give a really full bass.   They are also quieter,don't amplifiy as much,  so I can turn my volume up louder on my Klipsch 2.1's.   The adjustable range for volume was much more limited with the 627's.   On little bit too far and wow!!  They screamed!!   So sound level control is much nicer now as well.     Either of the opamps are cheap, at around 8 to 14 dollars or so.Thanks for a awesome card Asus.  One of these in a audio amp would cost a fortune!!  Slightly higher price paid for substitutable opamp slot is worth every extra cent paid!!I have xp and had no installation problems.  I really love this sound card.

Suddenly I realized my gaming rigs onboard audio could not pass 96ktz to a mini plug!!!  Enter Xonar DS.  The spex sold me.  At the 107 s/n db output,  you are basically getting the guts that are equivalent to my Marantz SR-7300!    Hookup was a snap!!  Installation was easy.  Sound with stock opamps was decent,  but I roll opamps quite a bit.  The Auzentech loves LME49710HA's-  a dual mono TO-99.Unfortuantely,  the LME49710HA did not fit into the board,  it hit the capacitors surrounding the plug.  I had on hand a LME49720HA- Single, dual channel TO-99.  This gave a nice detailed bass,  but the treble was very soft.  Luckily I also had a opa627SM dual module.  This opamp sounds the best,  the treble,  though mildly scratchy,  is perfect for my output of Klipsch 2.1's!!    So far these are the winners in this card for me.  Also they can be had on YABE for like $9.00!!!   The treble is really only scratchy when pushed above comfortable levels with a Equalizer.The definition is outstanding.   I also have a set of small TDC .5 Minis with a ribbon tweeter hooked into the Klipsch's playing back in 2.1 stereo.  I don't really use the other channels.All in all the Xonar sounds like a really nice Push Pull Amp, and the Meridien sounds like a warmer tube amp. I hate to admit it,  but the music sounds awesome on theXonar!!  And the price I paid for the Auzentech..... still the Auzentec was the ultimate for the Analog captures.I also killed my parakeet by playing back the russian meteor event.  That scared him!!!  Must have brought back bad dinosaur memories for him!!!I also like that this is the larger type PCI card in the plugs.I can mount it lower and farther away from my power source.  The newer ones are farther up and closer to possible interference sources.Stranglers Aural Sculpture sounds insanely good!!! I hate to say it, but even better than the Auzentech.  This is a excellent card for the money,  they won't look the same anymore as they go over to the metal can capacitors in the future."," Well hmm,  The dual to-99 did not fit.  Which is no great loss cause the 627SM module sound great!!!     Make sure you get the dual 627sm module,  a dual to single opamp adapter.It's kinda confusing= the one with a opamp on the top and bottom!!Equalizer works with videos,  but the music it does not,  I just use the EQ in Windows Media Player.   If you were to intstall Foobar and Asio4all for Foobar,  then you would get a even better sounding player for playback.  I do no do this on my game rig cause I don't like the conficts,  and having to remember all the settings in foobar.  Not that its bad,  it just complicates things.  I do use Foobar in my audio rig.

Usually I prefer to bump up frequencies over 8K by a few dB to give audio a more crisp and clear sound than stock/flat.  That was certainly the case with integrated mobo audio but it's completely unnecessary with this card.  Noise floor is also extremely low.

Analysis revealed that the Xonar was the culprit.  I reinstalled the drivers and pressed on.  A few days later, to my dismay, it somehow totally corrupted the boot partition on my OCZ Vertex 2 SSD (my primary drive) and I had to send it in to OCZ for repair.  Fortunately, this is a problem with which OCZ is well aware - they call it the ""Black Screen of Death"" and it is apparently known to kill certain OCZ SSDs.  OCZ was quick to send me a brand new SSD to replace my old one (thanks OCZ!) and I tried the Xonar with the new drive.  Within days I was getting random freezes again, so I permanently removed the Xonar and my OCZ SSD is working like a champ.Note to ASUS: Update your Xonar drivers.

The Drivers are horrible. The Asus DS Xonar Control Center is horrible. Has all these fancy little dumb features like reverb, flexBass, etc. that just screw with your sound if you turn them on. It has an auto-volume leveling feature that I couldn't figure out how to turn off. This caused every song I listened to or any game I played to sound horrible and jumbled together. I had to uninstall the driver and reinstall it to fix this issue. My levels were no longer limited so I start listening to some music. I noticed that the lows coming from my sub were extremely muddy. To the point that I could hardly hear tone, just muddy rumble. So I messed with my sub to no avail. I got fed up and plugged my speakers into my onboard sound card at 24-bit 192 and the sound is a million times better. I hear tone in my bass again and my levels sound great. My highs are more clear and my mids are coming across better."," Honestly, if you have an onboard card that was made in the last 4-5 years, then it will serve you better than this.

Teamed with a set of Logitech Z623 spoeakers, this makes a solid combo sound wise. The increase in sound stage depth, clarity, instrument separation and quality is noticeable. Headphone hookup is very nicely done and accepts a full size headphone jack, has a built in stereo microphone. Volume knob is large and easy to use. Have not used the built in stereo microphone as yet."," A minor caveat regarding the software, not a glitch... when having headphones plugged into the accessory headphone you must switch between speakers and headphones via the Speakers/Headphones tabnone a", Intel Core i7-3770 Ivy Bridge 3.4GHzMSI Z77A-G45 LGA 1155 Intel Z77G.SKILL Ripjaws X Series 16GB (2 x 8GB)MSI N560GTX Twin Frozr II/OCSanDisk Extreme 240GB SSD (boot drive)WD Caviar Black 2TB (Storage drive)WD Green 1.5 TB (Backups)ASUS DRW-24B1ST SATA DVDRosewill CAPSTONE 650W Modular PSUSound Blaster ZxRosewill BLACKHAWK Gaming ATX Mid TowerLogitech Z623 200 w 2.1 Speakers,0,1

Works ok except I cannot get games to output 5.1 audio through toslink. It only works in media players because codec can be set to send out Dolby/DTS directly. Games however do not encode their audio internally so my only option is to connect through analog, and thats where the ALC889 shows it's weakness. It has some strange delay in the 2 rear channels when you rotate yourself in the game.I used to own an Audigy 2 and I love their sound quality, but it didn't have toslink. I really want to have toslink hooked up to my receiver so I started looking at new sound cards. I don't wanna pay more than 150 bucks and this card is the only one that is priced under 150 with all the features I want ( 5.1 + toslink + dolby digital live / DTS connect )I'm glad I picked up this card because not only I can get perfect positional audio through realtime Dolby / DTS encoding, it also simultaneously output audio in both analog and digital, which ALC889 fails to do. I have my computer hooked up to both monitor and home theater and I switch between the 2 often. I'm tired of having to switch audio output whenever I want to play games on TV <-> go back to work desk. The feature it provides in the audio control panel is far superior to what ALC889 provides, and audio quality is top notch. Mic is also crystal clear, and driver is very good at noise cancellation. A lot of people says Creative messed up their Recon3D series, but they definitely nailed this one.",1,1

I have not tried digital out but I did try the analog outputs with 5.1 Logitech surround speakers. The best features are in the software., I really wanted this card for gaming using the scout mode but I found the regular surround option to be better.

9SIA1N82835448,29-132-052,9/12/2012 4:56:57 PM,Steven L.,Great card that can't be beat for the $$$,5," O.K. let me start off by stating that for $40 you will not find a better sound card than this! It uses the O2 chipset that is used on much more expensive cards that are double this $40 price. This card is rated at 105 D.B. and it sounds like it! It has great easy to use software with a nice E.Q. The card is a slim low profile design which just looks nicer. It will support 5.1; 4.1; and 2.1 speaker setups thru it's chipset. It will mimic 7.1 if you like that, I don't. It not only plays game effects well, but MP3s and WMA files all sound really great! Nice built in amplifier for your headphones. However if you go above 50 OHMs this card is not for you! I really can't say enough good things about this card. Note: I'm a level 3 Tech. that has worked in I.T. since 1995 and I'll never buy a SoundBlaster product again! They really have poor driver support, which is done on porpous to get everyone to spend money on a new card!!"," The only con to this sound card is the fact that you can't really use the front panel H.D. plug ins efectively! They will play sound o.k. but you can't get the amplifier to boost your headphones thru the front ports for some reason. Hey I can live with it when I only spent $40 for the card. Yes it's a inconvienent to have to un-plug your headphone and plug in your speakers. I guess I should state that you just have to get off your lazy but* and manually change the back plug to switch from speakers to headphones. But for only $40, I'll say it again it really not a con! The reality is that all the Soundblaster cards and even the higher end Asus gaming card is still only 24bit@ 96 KLH and does not justify the money you will spend on a $200 card unless you get into recording. If that's the case you would not be buying a gaming card in the first place. You would buy a very high end, low latency card just for recording and not for gaming."," All in all as I have mentioned this card can not be beat for a price of only $40 with all the different settings you get. I have a older Klipch Promedia THX 4.1 speaker system and this card really brought new life to these great sounding speakers! This sounds better than the Creative Quad core card and although that card can handle 256 individual sound compared to 128 by this card. This card just sounds better in every way. Note: If you get hiss when you move your mouse on your desktop it's a bad card. I purchased mine from Amaz** and had a new card sent for free, while I still had the old card. The new card is absolutly great!!! No hiss what so ever, that is until you go to play an old MP3. However that's not the cards fault, it's the recording!! I have tried $200 sound cards at the shop for trail runs!! Nothing out on the market justifies the cost! Not when you can buy this baby for $40 and have all your needs met!!!",9,9
9SIA1N82835448,29-132-052,8/31/2012 7:09:49 AM,Brandon W.,Good card for the money,4, It's very affordableDoes wonders to enhance all ranges of sound even on the mediocre speakers I'm using ( X-540s) and Skull Candy GI headphones. The bass is much punchier and more clear on the X-540s. The volume has a much higher ceiling with this card . When playing BF3 I hear sounds that I never even knew were in the game with on-board.I noticed myself turning around MUCH faster as I could hear people walking up on me from quite a bit further away than before., Drivers were a challenge to install. Every time I tried installing it would finish and then stop. The program would still be running(verified by task manager) but It wouldn't do anything. So I would just hard reset each time. I did this maybe 3  or 5 times and magically on the last attempt when I booted up the drivers were installed.. There is also occasionally a bit of EXTREMELY low static hissing from my speakers that I can hear .05 seconds before a song starts. It also sometimes happens when I open the drivers program. Closing and reopening the program causes the static to go away. It may be my speakers or it could be the drivers/hardware. I guess I'll find out when I get new speakers. The hissing is VERY low and I doubt the average person would hear it so don't fret over that., Even with those to flaws I'd still easily recommend this to anyone who wants an upgrade over on board. It's not an audiophile card obviously but it is a noticeable upgrade and well worth the 40$.,None,None

Bought it for my HTPC earlier this month for digital audio and epic sound.," Default PCM is useless and outdated in this day and age, and I don't want to pick and choose when DTS is enabled. This card does NOT have a feature to automatically stream all audio in DTS.Installation was relatively nightmarish but that was probably due to me attempting to deploy Windows 8 RC but rolling back to Windows 7 removed the hassle. The real issue I had with this card is that while ASUS claims that DTS is possible on this card through speakers option, it cannot be set as the default and stay as the default. It will only have PCM on its dropdown. Tried to troubleshoot this for several hours but have since gave up and reverted to a Creative USB card solution. The card's software is also unintuitive and clunky, much prefer Creative's audio manager of this card's."," I'm pretty sure the headphones option is great on this card and was probably meant for this card, and I'm also sure this card is great, but its just not what I needed.

I can barely get above 20-30% without hurting my ears on the DG front panel. Not only can I go well beyond that (some songs aren't loud enough!), the volume range from 50% to 100% is literally the same volume, i can literally dance the volume knob on the control panel back and forth and not hear any difference. This is using the same exact settings (Exciter mode), Uni Drivers, and headphones (Denon AH-D2000) as what I use with the DG. This is now my third DGX, and the same problem with every single one, in two different computers, with both the official and Uni drivers.If you think your card is working properly, plug your headphones into the back, and be prepared to be blown away by how much louder it is in the back.

I looked for a while and thought maybe my card had gone bad.  Eventually I found the solution being that there was a small dropdown box within the software to choose between sound setups (headphone. 2.1, 5.1, etc.).  I had assumed this was to differentiate the number of speakers, but it seems to also correlate to whether the front panel audio is to be used as an output.In other words, if your sound disappears after unplugging headphones, check the software and switch it from 'headphones' to '2.1' (or whatever).",1,1

My absolute favorite thing about it is that it doesn't require any special drivers. If you plug it into any computer running Windoes XP, it will work immediately with no further setup required. It is small enough to carry in your pocket. It has a short connector cable, but I think that this is an advantage.

It is fine for powering headphones at medium listening levels, and would be great for connection to external speakers, but you aren't going to get screaming loud levels out of the jack. I noticed that this device uses very little amounts of power on the USB connection. It will even work on a keyboard USB port.

9SIA4RE4VP4156,29-102-033,5/5/2011 11:47:15 PM,Daniel M.,An X-Fi card - nothing special either way,3," I'm using a Yamaha YSP-4000.  This means my connectivity options are left/right analog - and that's IT for analog - S/PDIF (either coaxial or optical), and HDMI.  The THD is primarily an optical S/PDIF card - so it seems like the right fit.I wanted an X-Fi card to maintain compatibility with my existing library of EAX games.  That narrows my choices down quite a bit.  For the price, and based on the specs, looked like the THD was the deal.Packaging looks nice initially.  The part that I think is rather stupid is the included connectivity.k - got it physically mounted - no issues. Driver time! I uninstalled my existing drivers for my Creative X-Fi Fatal1ty that had failed - including the DDL/DTS pack I paid extra for 2 years ago, installed the new ones - and no sound. After fiddling with my setup for a while, including temporarily disabling my AMD Radeon HDMI audio - got sound back.So...the card works.  5.1 sound over optical S/PDIF via DDL or DTS.  Yippee."," By the way - the connectors LOOK like they're coaxial S/PDIF - they're NOT! Optical only!  The THD uses mini optical S/PDIF - instead of the standard S/PDIF connectors.  Included with the card are a pair of SHORT mini-S/PDIF to regular S/PDIF cables.  If this card is intended for a HTPC located adjacent to a receiver then maybe it makes sense.  As I'm installing the card in my gaming tower case, with my Yamaha mounted on the wall 8 feet away - those silly cables are useless.  Order a mini-S/PDIF to regular S/PDIF adapter plug (find it on @mazon for under $3). Why Creative couldn't include a pair of these...?!As for drivers - I continue to have issues with X-Fi mode switching. The thing is, while I can tell a difference in games when I'm not in gaming mode, I don't recognize anything significant for movies. Maybe if I used more of the X-Fi processing on my media I'd hear something different - but right now I don't. So I've turned off the auto-switcher - and just leave it in Game mod"," Overall - I'm underwhelmed. I don't know if I'd hear anything different from a ""pure"" digital connection using one of the HDMI options - I'd have to have one to compare. And having heard a few comments regarding lack of support & quality on the Auzen, plus a lack of an X-Fi option in the other choice (Xonar) - I'll probably stay with this card.In summary - I'd have to say, if you want a card that will provide a 5.1 DDL/DTS signal to a receiver, using an optical S/PDIF connection, and you have any interest in EAX support - this card will do it. Keep in mind the need to purchase a cable adapter if your receiver is more than a foot away from your PC (and that means the PORTS, not just the boxes!). If you're looking for an upgrade from any existing X-Fi - this isn't it.",8,9

(Up to 5.1 channels.)", I almost bought a Xonar instead. Why? Because I was quite afraid that I'd end up incredibly frustrated with the software.Creative Labs has always been (and seemingly always will be) well-known and notorious for writing some of THE WORST software and drivers for their hardware. So much so that independent developers took up the cause of writing better drivers FOR them as their engineers didn't seem to be capable of doing so.This software is better than what I've been cursed with in the past when it comes to Creative Labs' products... But not by much. I installed the card and took a deep sigh as I slipped the install disc into my drive. I knew what was coming., FRUSTRATION. Be advised that the card does NOT give you more than FL/FR analog channels. One of the RCA ports is actually OPTICAL OUT. But...you have to configure the card to turn on the Dolby Digital before you even hear anything. The software conflicts with itself - activating/deactivating settings seems to make things worse until you are finally forced to set it all back to DEFAULT...and even deinstall/reinstall the software to get it all back to default. (Yeah. Had to do it one time.)The configuration screens make absolutely no sense. They imply analog ports that don't exist. They give test options for audio that the card should have no issue with...but keeps them disabled claiming that the option is not available. (96 Khz speakers...but not supported? Seriously? But wait... That was yesterday. NOW it works today? WTH?)NO Creative Labs product is without infuriating installation/management experiences.Sorry Creative Labs. You really need to work harder at this. THREE EG,8,12

I had sound crackling and distortion depending on the Creative Control Panel settings, so it was seemingly software related. Looks like this card doesn't suffer from all the issues, and there are a lot of really great reviews for this card, and I'd have to agree that this is a quality card. I do like the build quality of this thing, and the sound quality was great even with me just using AUX In. However-"," No 7.1 surround support (Green, Orange, Black)""Considering that the card offers only a stereo line out on the RCAs and a headphone output, we can conclude that it is not possible to connect analog surround speakers directly to the sound card; for that, we would need to use extra equipment like a separate amplifier or decoder and connect the card via the optical interface to it.

I came from the X-Fi Titanium Fatal1ty Pro and the difference going from that to this is night and day. The surround sound positioning is so much better and everything is much more crisp and pronounced. On my old card I would hear a sound and know what it's supposed to be- with this card I hear the sound and my ears BELIEVE it is the actual sound because the accuracy is that good. There have been a few times when watching a movie or playing a game, I will hear a door shut or something drop on the floor and I snapped my head around because I thought it was something going on in the room I'm sitting in. It really is that good. Also, listening to my old music I hear so much more I never knew was there before, but of course, it takes FLAC encoding to really bring out the card's true potential. Don't knock it because you listen to crumby MP3s. I have heard several pricey, extravagant home theaters that don't match my PC setup."," I consider the card as having no cons- I would pay $300 for a sound card that sounds this good, heck, I might even pay $400. I have no issues with Creative's drivers- never have and this is my third Creative sound card. Of course, download the latest drivers from Creative's website."," I use the Creative Sound Blaster Tactic 3D Sigma headset and the Logitech Z-5500s with my card. I had trouble getting the speakers to work at first, and found little help in a google search, but I got it. All you have to do is use the optical cord that comes with the card, connect it to the Logitech hub, and set the input to optical. DTS Connect or Dolby Digital encoding isn't supported through the Creative software in Windows 7, but I switch between the DD effects that the speakers support through hardware and it sounds SUPERB. Watched a few blu-rays and played a few games- the surround positioning for 5.1 is perfect. Again, night and day coming from Creative's previous top-end card. For music, I use the stereo x2 effect and it the most amazing sound my ears have ever heard. So, if you are considering buying a different card because this one 'only supports stereo', there are ways of getting 5.1 to work. I highly, highly recommend this card for anyone who owns Z-5500s like I do.",4,6

Honestly the price was good with the 30 dollar off, special code. If i had to pay full price i would have waited and gone HT Omega. One of their high enders with headphone amp, spent more.. This card is good don't get me wrong! I am thrilled with Creative after trying to get something worth listening to out of my old Audigy 2 board. Well its over 6 years old, so it was time to upgrade..Really no room to complain. I was slightly shell shocked in after buying Creative over the years. Sorta expecting some garbage to come up installing on Windows 7 64 but install went smooth BE SURE UNLOAD ALL OTHER SOUND DRIVERS SHUT DOWN ANYTHING IN BIOS IN REGARDS TO A BOARD SOUND CHIP.You should be go to go! Well i mentioned below had issues with getting the DTS and Dolby option checked and working.Had to load a BETA driver on Creative site. At least they were fast to get a BETA driver fix up and out! would have returned othwise"," ON BOARD SOUND, ANY OB CHIP/S! Mother Board sound chip/s cant even come to anything remotely close to pleasurable! SO just shell out the beans for a good good (DO THE REVIEWS SOUND CARD.)People make it a part of the must have when building. You cant live with on board chip for sound its really mickey mouse! Ba OH WELL as its just that way. And the pleasure after having something GREAT! Money well spent! You be (pi ss ed) if you own high ender speaker system without a GREAT sound card! So don't blame your speakers if you have ON BOARD SOUND. Creative has offered up a great package on this HD model! You'll not be short on options to fit your movies and music. Don't expect MP3 to sound good on any card.Music FLAC at least is my opinion I am having a mental or-gasum with MSFL recordings  WOW REAL WOW.Mp3 is real waste of money if thats your main music you listen to. I use VLC Player for movies (5-1 option) all options are AOK.Haven't tried my POWER DVD 10 yet will  run movie AVATAR to test"," I had issues with Windows 7 64  DTS and Dolby foiled until i went to site and loaded the listed BETA driver download. No issues with the BETA (fix i call it) driver/s so far been switching and clicking away trying to cause an issue and so far none :) ...I must admit i like the software Creative has come up with many options all usable. So i should not complain...LOOK, I AM PLEASED WITH CREATIVE THIS TIME AROUND. THIS CARD COMES THROUGH BIGTIME. HA! I put my HT OMEGA STRIKER in my fathers machine and its like saying goodbye to a very loved old friend. Omega makes some kick as s boards! if you are hesitant on a high ender Creative makes then go Omega Claro, or Claro Plus at least! Go see Omega. Again I feel good about this Creative board! nice options on the rear and two opt light cables but only can be used with this board. Its all good after the Beta driver fix :)  TRITTON AX Pro Dolby Digital 5.1 True Surround Sound GREAT!  All my headphones, buds ,cheap and or expensive sound good.",3,7

9SIA4RE4VP4156,29-102-033,1/28/2011 6:51:03 PM,Anonymous,Definitely Better,5," Incredible sound from the get go. My Studio monitors never had anything that clear before and the RCA jack at the back mean I don't need a special splitter/adapter, reducing possible noise and static.  Sound is very crisp and installation went smoothly despite CD-only availiability.  The cover sheilding was a concern at first but even slotted right next to an HD5870 video card there is no noise whatsoever.  The IntelHD connector on top of the card is a nice touch too."," Trouble with said IntelHD connector as when I plugged in my case, sound refused to come out the speakers until I plugged/unplugged the case's jackes a couple of time.  Creative was responsive in good delays but blame my case's individual connectors. (Termaltake Armor 2 uses 7 tiny square connectors labeled to the different pins for you to connect individually.. it is made to be compatible with AC'97 jacks AND Intel HD) Lack of other front-panel accessibility like the Audigy and Previous X-Fi is also a bit of a let down.. for now."," Overall this card is the perfect successor to my Audigy 2 ZS pro and allows the microphone to work in 64-bit over-2gb of RAM environnement as well.

If you're using Win 10 you'll have to download drivers/software from Creative's Win 10 support page for this card.   All I use the card for is gaming (sound output through my home theater system), and music (headphones)--it has many features I don't use, and can not comment on one way or another.   My old sound card was an ancient external Creative USB X-Fi 5.1.  My only complaint about it was a persistent high pitched back ground whine apparent when playing games; otherwise I was very satisfied.  The sound Blaster Z PCIe just totally blows the old card away, gaming sound and music are noticeably cleaner (much more advanced sound processor), and sound out put is much higher (old 106db SNR vs new 116db SNR).  The sound card control panel is improved/more user friendly in my opinion.  Wished I'd upgraded ages ago!"," As pictured above; the card comes with a nice looking red anodized aluminum shroud, and a fairly bright red LED inside a clear circular window in the middle of the shroud (here comes the ""but"").  But, looking at my mid tower head on; the MB is on the R (like most comps I suspect), because of that, and the Sound Blaster's configuration the darn thing mounts upside down on the MB so all the bling is on the bottom and not visible.  I'm looking at the rather plain unattractive bottom of the card.  It's not really an issue for me, as I have a windowless case, and the insides aren't visible when the side panel is in place.  This might be an issue for YOU; if your rig has a window, and your MB is on the R side of your case.  Be warned!", I definitely recommend this card for gaming and music!,3,3

9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,10/3/2016 8:46:57 PM,Matthew e.,All Hype,3, Nice to look at.Pretty gold connector jacks.Great marketing team.Pushes extremely loud and decently clean sound out to headphones and speakers.," Yes, that red light is obnoxiously bright.Loud popping through outputs when powering on/off PC. The control panel is extremely awkward.Only one audio stream in, only one out at a time (but we should know that from the description).Latency on the microphone is horrific and unpredictable."," I bought this card because Win 10 wouldn't let me run all the sound software that came with my MB and I figured it seems to be modern and very popular but now I realize it's popularity is probably ONLY due to their marketing.  I am giving it 3 stars because it does put out nice clean and loud sound but only slightly better than my onboard.  It has no environmental or spacial effects like it implies, just simple output to the rear channels.  It does handle ghosting you a center speaker if you don't have one but so did onboard.  This is my beef:  If you use any of the effects for the microphone like Noise Reduction or Echo Cancellation, it creates latency so bad it's almost a full second at times.  But then sometimes you click around the settings on and off then it's less, sometimes it's even tolerable but it shouldn't be all over the place.  It's difficult to record or have a conversation (VOIP) with headphones on and you can't hear your own voice, especially if you are gaming.  Like I said though if you disable the Noise Reduction and the other processing the latency is gone, BUT the noise you get from the microphone is STUPID loud, like you are in a hurricane.Another problem is that voice recognition software can barely make out what you are saying and using Cortana went from flawless with my onboard sound to completely unreliable with this SoundBlaster Z.  Maybe (I hope) it gets solved with some better drivers.",4,7
9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,10/2/2016 12:18:36 PM,Aleksey K.,Pretty bad,1, It comes in a nice box?," I dont even know where to start, but I guess ill start with the minor stuff and then go from there.The Red LED on the sound card is super bright. It doesnt bother me much how it doesnt match with my case theme (blue). But what does bother me about the LED is that its so bright, that it lights up my entire room at night and sometimes I have to turn off my PC in order to sleep (my case is always open). Its really not hard to add a feature to turn off the LED, all you have to do is add ONE DRICKIN TRANSISTOR TO THE CIRCUIT which costs less than 3 cents, and that is DIGIKEY prices which are expensive, I guarantee you can get them for less than a penny from China.Next point, this sound card comes with a ""free bonus microphone"". Now that ""optional free bonus microphone"" is actually pretty bad and its not actually optional at all. To start it off, the quality is pretty garbagee, honestly it sounds like Im talking underwater. I mean if you want to make youtube videos of swimming with sharks or other fish, then this microphone would be for you, but other than that its complete garbage and any dollar store mic will be better than this garbage. Instead of adding a garbage microphone, they couldve instead saved that money and use it on a transistor to give you the option to turn off the super bright red LED. That would bring my 1/5 stars rating on this product to maybe 1.5/5And what they DID NOT mention is: in order for ALL of your microphone features to ACTUALLY work properly (noise cancellation, voice changer, etc), you HAVE to use that garbage microphone that was provided. If you use any other microphone, the features do not work at all...and if they do, they provide even worse results.  So much for a ""OPTIONAL free bonus microphone"".Another point, and this happened with my previous soundblaster cards in the past with different motherboard configurations: After installing this new ""amazing"" sound card: I hear a little buzzing noise through my speakers, its like the soundcard is confliting with something (maybe the video card). Its not that loud, and you don't hear it at all when you have music playing. But if you have no sounds playing, you can definitely hear it.I am also using a 5.1 speaker surround sound setup, and I had to turn off my front middle speaker because the sounds that were coming through that were constantly turning on and off. Its like the sound card kept trying to balance the sound between the speakers and couldnt decide between the middle one so it just kept turning on and off.I have uninstalled this piece of garbage from my computer - with the PC off of course, but I was really tempted to just rip it out of the slot because I couldnt wait to remove it (I lied, its actually still in the slot, I just dont use it. Im too scared to remove it because I feel like I will get a driver problem when I remove it and Ill have to reformat my PC). I am now back to my standard FREE Realtek sound drivers, which came with my motherboard. The FREE default realtek sound drivers actually have microphone noise cancellation that do work with any microphone, and the quality is alright (95% of the time they are good).So how come this default sound card in my motherboard is way better than this garbage sound card from Creative? Not to mention that my entire motherboard was cheaper than this sound card alone.For anyone buying this product, I recommend not buying ANY garbage from Creative. I have had TONS of problems with them in the past (please dont get me started on it, especially their drivers). I thought I might not be satisfied with this product when I decided to buy it, but I decided to try it out and give Creative another chance.You know when you expect something to suck, and you are are still so disappointed when you try it out because it did not even meet your low expectations - yeah thats this product. The last time I had that experience was with Call of Duty Ghosts."," I do not recommend this product, or any other product from Creative. The realtek HD drivers on your motherboard are better than this garbage.The only reason why I would ever recommend this product is if you need to melt some copper during a world apocalypse and you can't buy copper anywhere else. This would be the product to go to because it would be the last product remaining on the shelves since its so bad.",4,13

It has decent sound quality and picks up my voice reasonably well"," The first sound card I bought from them had major issues with headphones (I'm using Astro A40's) and occasionally with speakers.  Out of nowhere (usually while playing games, but sometimes while listening to music in iTunes), the volume output is maxed out and the sound is massively distorted. It basically sounds like listening to a radio station that you can't quite pick up, but at max volume (despite the fact that it's set to 8%).  So I RMA'd it for a replacement.  The replacement was better for a while, but just recently (and about 2 weeks outside of Newegg's 30 day return window), it did the same thing again.  This is totally unacceptable, Creative's sound card hurt my ears and nearly ruined my headphones twice now."," Hopefully I can a refund through Creative, because quite frankly I don't want a replacement.  Also, I really don't understand what's up with the fake velvet packaging inside the box, all it does is get fuzz all over the sound card and make me waste time cleaning it before I install it.

9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,7/30/2016 8:14:56 AM,Anonymous,CREATIVE Sound Blaster Z GREAT SOUND CARD for less than 100$,5," I'm owner of Sound Blaster Z from 2013 and I have very positive experience with this sound card on two motherboards, Z77 and X99. Sound quality is great for 100$ hardware and every real gamer should invest in sound card at least this level.Quality of sound compare to Onboard audio is incredible. And I compare with best onboard sound SupremeFX 2014.If people invest 500-600-700-1000$ for graphic cards and 300-500$ for processors and replace after 2-3 years than investing in sound card once in 5-7 years, 100$ it's nothing. You will never think is it onboard audio good enough and you could choose motherboard no matter on onboard audio quality. Sound is very clear and you hear sounds and noises not recognizable on onboard solutions. Difference between shooting from different gun is clear, nicely defined sound for games and movies same as music off course if you have good speakers and receiver.", Only problem with this card I had on ASUS X99 motherboard and I can describe that as sound tearing or I don't know how to describe that. In mean time sound is fantastic and every 2-3 min you hear on 1 sec some kind of distortion as you move turntable pin. But I resolve that with driver from CD I got. Only that driver oldest no problem. Later Creative explain me that SBZ have problems with ASUS X99 boards. But I resolve that and I know that card work because she work on any other board without problems. If you have similar issue try first driver from CD 02. October 2012.Flaw for some people is only 5.1 support but for me 7.1 is not so important option. Clear sound from 5.1 system could satisfy everyone.," I would bought this card again.

Let me start by saying if you are looking to drive your headphones/headset only, then this card IS for you. Its affordable and does sound pretty good after playing with the EQ a bit. The reason this card doesn't work for me and the reason it will probably be going back is that there is no way to have separate audio streams going on it. This means that I can't use VoIP and have a game's audio coming through my headset while playing music on my nice speakers. This is a HUGE deal breaker for me.  I thought that since it offered the front audio connector I would be able to run it just like I did with my on board audio, this is not the case.

The last card I had was a Sound Blaster Live! years ago. I read a lot of reviews about this card and it seemed all were positive so I bought one.I am glad I did, I do PC gaming and listen to a fair bit of music. My gaming experience has been excellent; I now hear sounds I have never heard before. The software with the card allows for a lot of tweaking and makes any audio experience more enjoyable. The EQ in the software allows for significant sound adjustment and there are extra adjustments for bass and 5.1 setups also.As for those who complain about the LED brightness, they are somewhat justified. The red LED's are bright and if you have a case sitting on your desk with a acrylic side window(like I do), you will notice it for the first bit but you get used to it.I currently have an old Cambridge Sound Works DTT 2500 setup for my speakers. I mostly use it in stereo mode since my PC area does not allow for convenient placement of 5.1. It still works great but I'm getting a set of Polk RTi4's to see if I can further improve my audio. I'm also using TurtleBeach Z60 headphones. They usually connect through USB but I now connect them directly to the card and it improves a lot. The scout option in the software while gaming is excellent, I can hear enemies coming before they know I'm there.When connecting a headset, make sure the volume for headsets is down to about 5%. That's where I have it now and the volume is comfortable, any more and it gets uncomfortably loud. I use Skype with my headset and I have noticed a vast improvement there also. The beamforce mic does a good job considering it sits out in the open near my speakers. Just fine tune the angle of the mic sensitivity in the softwere and turn down the gain to get rid of feedback.I also realize how most people forget how great audio can sound. With audio streaming, mp4, mp3, youtube, etc. Most of us don't get the full audio experience anymore. This helps that area a lot. I get more fuller music playback now then I ever did before(even with the use of mp3's).

See cons.," After about 4 months I started having intermittent problems with this card. I shrugged them off. They started getting worse. Fast forward one more month. Any microphone plugged into this card becomes 100% unusable do to an electronic garbling sound. None of the fixes online were able to make it functional again. Again I shrugged it off and just started using the card without a mic. Fast forward a week, this card begins to have an issue where if it detects ANY sounds from ANY program if cuts the volume on every single other program by at least 85% sometimes it fully mutes them.At this point I was expecting the problem to be coming from Skype or something else on my PC. Uninstall every program, reinstall windows, same issue. Unplug sound card and use the onboard. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? PROBLEM SOLVED.Forget this card people. This took me two weeks of constantly trying to fix the problem for me to finally narrow it down to this card after 100% eliminating every single other possibility. Thanks Creative, first time giving you guys another go after so many problems a decade ago and you let me down spectacularly once again."," No, do not buy this card.",4,6

I am running Optical to my SONY Home theatre receiver with full tower speakers, and all i can say is wow! I used to run HDMI for video and sound which gave FULL 3D positional audio on my 7.1 system.

On-board sound will never compare to discrete cards and in my cases the sound chip on the motherboard will have no adjustment features, such as BASS & TREBLE, at least that's why Asus came with, just the chip and a mediocre sound, that couldn't even deliver to a $20 pair of Sony headsets. With the new SB-Z, I cannot even get to level 7 before getting extremely loud and now my $20 headset sound like a $200 headset, sound is clear and have so many great features to tweak the sound with the software bundle included. The RED light doesn't bother me at all, the PC sits on the floor despite it's inside a Corsair 450D which has a huge acrylic panel. Yes, I'd definitely recommend the SB-Z, you can never go wrong with one of them, the difference between this and an on-board chips is a day and night difference.Don't have 2nd thoughts about thinking that it's not going to make a difference, buy it and you'll see that this is definitely a great improvement overall for your PC and luckily if you build another system in the near future, say 5 years from now, you'll definitely going to be able to re-use the SB-Z, just like I was able with my Audigy Gamer which I used for 10 years, till PCI was no longer supported on high-end motherboards.

Interface is a wee bit confusing at first, but not hard to figure out."," Let's see.. My on-board audio with my ASUS motherboard is pretty much as good or better than this card. I have a custom 5.1 surround system and thought maybe this card would boost my sound a bit better. In all honesty, if you put it on 2.1 sound, it comes through with a clarity I've not ever heard. But put it on 5.1 and it seriously degrades the quality and clarity. No matter what settings you put, EQ or Clarity in SBX Pro Studio settings, it just doesn't sound that good at all. The frequencies are all over the place, the sub frequencies have some distortion.. Certain frequencies overpower the others and cause a dampening effect which is very very annoying. It's almost like smartphone EQ's.. If you push the highs all the way up everything else tries to mute itself to provide the power for that one frequency to be heard. Same effect going on with this card which makes it rather useless.Also, on my motherboard audio I was able to control the volume via Windows. This sound card you have to use your receiver to control the volume. You can get around that by setting your sound properties so that no programs can control the audio driver, but if you want 5.1 surround for lets say movies, gaming, ect. you will lost that with that feature turned on.I will most likely be returning this card as it's just not worth the money and it adds a bit of a headache once it's set up. I much prefer the easy of use and sound from my ASUS motherboard over this card."," Bottom line, if you have a nice setup and an really old PC, then yeah this card will make a huge difference for you. But as a gamer with some of the latest tech, don't waste any extra money on a sound card. You really don't need it.",1,3

For added quality, I recommend configuring Windows to output a 24-bit audio signal of 96khz or better."," The Creative Audio Control Panel has been redone, and I personally find it less intuitive than previous versions.  Like so many things, it's become over-simplified instead of offering a simplified view and an advanced view.  If your intended use is for any kind of musical recording, I'd -strongly- advise buying an EMU series card that provides those I/O options now unavailable from SoundBlaster series cards.  It's clear from what little settings are available for recording that it was intended for vocal recording."," I'm using this card in a system running both Windows 7 Pro and Windows 10 Pro and shares living space with a nVidia graphics card that also has a DSP in it for HDMI output, and I have had absolutely zero driver-related problems with this card on either OS.  To ensure that your experience is also free from driver issues, be sure to purge your computer of any older CreativeLabs drivers and software before installing the latest drivers for this card.  I didn't use the disc that came with the card, rather I downloaded the drivers directly from us.Creative.com for Windows 7 and Windows 10.In order to do justice to this card's audio quality, I strongly recommend use of a home theater system instead of comparatively cruddy computer speakers.  I'm using a Kenwood receiver with a frequency response well outside human hearing range in both directions with speakers with a response of 20 to 42000hz and a subwoofer with a response of 4 to 300hz.  I've owned several Creative cards, including an EMU card, and none of them produced a signal that my receiver would actually recognize as full-range.  The bass was previously present, but was being routed to the subwoofer automatically instead of allowing my receiver to dissect the signal itself.  I've it configured to play in full-range, and I use the subwoofer for added fun with explosions and other such things.",2,2

I got my answer almost immediately after installing it, wow there was a huge difference the level of detail in music, gaming, videos, etc. I had no idea what I was missing until I installed this. It's advertised an MP3 music enhancing sound card, and by all means it is! However I noticed a huge difference in gaming with it. I play first person shooters a lot, mostly Battlefield franchise. And WOW, explosions are more impressive. Weapon sounds are more realistic, and the biggest difference I noticed was after installing it......I could actually hear footsteps of enemy players before they came around the corner or tried sneaking up behind me to melee me to death. Its actually saved me several times while playing, gave me time to turn around and fight back. After that experience I was completely sold on the card. Fast forward to today, 2016 I built a new computer and decided that I would try on-board sound again. I mean why not? There have been improvements in technology maybe on-board is as good as a 10 year old PCI sound card right? No way, Sound Blaster went right back in which i'm ok with.

In particular I expected a decent microphone input with good microphone volume levels, similar as I had with my very old Audigy 2 sound card. I am using speech recognition for work, this is why a good microphone input and mic preamp is important to me.Let's start with the horrible drivers which result in the Control Panel taking forever to load on Windows8.1. Even after reinstalling, driver cleaning, disabling the onboard etc. the SB Control Panel still lags extremely and is pretty much unusable.All the features of the card, whatever they call them in the Control Panel I consider useless *except* the equalizer. This can really help to turn ""flat"" sound into a really good, powerful experience with deep bass and clear treble. From that point of view I cannot complain about the card's sound quality.BUT: I can do the same with my RealTek. This too has an equalizer where I can set sufficient bass and treble, depending on my headphones and speaker setup. While I am not using the SBZ on a ""high-end"" speaker system, subjectively I can not hear a difference in sound quality with the SBZ and the RealTek. From that point of view, the SBZ is entirely pointless.I was hugely disappointed by the SBZ's mic input. It is not better than the RealTek and with dynamic microphones the mic level is far too low. If you increase mic boost, it introduces noise, indication of a low quality ADC/mic amp which is not better than OnBoard.It's ironic I hadn't ANY problem with my very old Audigy 2 card and Daniel K drivers on my old system. Very good sound and also decent microphone levels.Too bad that my new board has no PCI slots anymore otherwise I would continue to use the old Audigy 2 and be entirely happy with it.THIS card I consider overpriced and pointless and this doesn't even include the driver/control panel problems with Win8.1I can only recommend this if you have a really, really bad onboard sound...but I think those don't really exist anymore since onboard has come a long ways in the last few years. This is not 1995 any more where a dedicated sound card made a huge difference to onboard.",6,9

Love optical-in for my PS3 (though has to be PCM audio selection, 1 less cable visible just for audio) to output over PC speakers. Monitor does not have speakers to use HDMI (oddly does have that new ethernet port based plugin that isn't used yet which will carry HD audio+video encrypted signals)."," Creative control panel install removes the bass and treble controls Windows has by default. Worse still is it also disables other Windows audio controls, simple things that have worked for decades such as headphones plug in automatically swapped over to 2 channel audio instead of anything higher.What does that mean? It means headphones plugged into speakers higher than 2 channels is garbled playback for various video formats (music is unaffected, even in video formats, everything else though...). Creative did not add the feature that existed in Windows for 20+ years to automatically disable surround sound when headphones were plugged into the speakers directly. It took me several weeks to configure this junk software to get it to sound like my previous Creative Sound Blaster card.Creative support says those old settings are impossible to have due to OS changes for vista/win7/win8 (wrong). I had that older card working on Win7 without this issue. Headphones and all.Added bonus, time tinkering with the Creative control panel lead me to not tinker very much since actually changing things in it sometimes crashes the program + kills the entire audio playback service (which Win7 can restart without a reboot happily). So attempting fixes is at your own risk just clicking basic settings/speaker configurations.How to fix various issues with headphones:In Creatives Control Panel, SBX Pro Studio sectionPower button icon, alt text SBX Pro Studio On/Off. Turn it off for headphone usage.How to fix overpowering Bass since you cannot adjust it in Windows sound with Creative Control Panel installed:Under section Speakers/Headphones, Lots of tweeking with sub-woofer Crossover Frequency (Bass redirection ticked to be On)Further fixing if you have full range speakers:Equalizer section, The 3 sliders on the left are the lower frequency controls for Bass. Tweek as desired.You can try to adjust Bass levels directly in the Creative Control Panel, if they weren't greyed out (disabled). Note Bass Redirection exists on the SBX pro studio section, greyed out. Speakers/Headphones section has the usable one (what?) but does not have the Bass volume control at all, that is in the first one where it is greyed out."," I spent more than a few days actual time (not entirely all at once) trying to figure out how to fix this junk. I'd fix one issue, find another. All of it stems from Creative disabling the most basic Windows OS sound control features in favor of their software in which they left out said features.I made a phone call to Newegg (yes, actual phone call) asking them to drop Creative's products. They've known how their software was for years. I don't see them making any attempt to fix this so I think hitting them where it hurts (resellers dropping their products) is the most appropriate response.1 eggs, not the hardware's fault the software to use it is garbage.

9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,3/26/2015 10:03:33 AM,Kyle B.,This VS onboard Realtek,5," I will be comparing this to the onboard Realtek HD audio that comes on most boards these days as it is what I have been using for years. The ALC892 is what I was using up until I got the SBZ.On the surface, both the Realtek and the SB are the same. They even use the same Cirrus Logic DACs for the analog audio. If using the optical port, it doesn't matter which sound card you use as it is decoded by the receiver, so is the SBZ even worth paying $100 for if you already have onboard HD audio? If you have a 5.1 system, especially one as stupidly designed as the Logitech z906, then the answer is Yes, absolutely.The difference between the onboard and the SBZ revolves around the software that the SBZ is able to utilize and accelerate via its own hardware and processes which gives a much more robust manipulation of your audio setup. It can even take the 5.1 analog streams and convert them into DTS on the fly, something that onboard can't do. The best thing about it is the control it gives you of individual speakers and subs. If you have a 5.1 system like the Z906 which has a sub that has no level controls on it whatsoever, you can use the SBZ software to set the frequencies you want the sub to pick up in addition to the phase and gain. You can totally tweak every aspect of your system and tune it to get the perfect sound from it. It also has some headphone-specific features that I haven't explored yet but, at a glance, it's already better than the Realtek's options which only let you control volume.It also has proprietary methods of making voice chat crystal clear for you and the people who hear you if you use a mic/headset for online gaming. Also comes with a ""beamforming microphone"" which appears to just be an external mic like the ones that used to come with all pre-built computers, only a different shape. It's just a mic in the end though. Can't seem to get excited about that. Very easy to set up and requires a couple reboots and a little bit of manual device management right out of the box and the software package takes care of everything for you, software-wise. It installs the entire suite of programs and then automatically updates them via the internet so you're up-to-date."," -This LED nonsense has got to stop. Every single performance component that goes into a custom PC these days has bright LEDs all over it and, for some reason, the SBZ also has BRIGHT RED lights coming from it. With the lights from the case, mobo and video card and now the SBZ, my machine looks like some christmas freak show. There is no way to tun off this light... -This uses a PCI express port. Not a terrible thing on its own, but these ports are right next to your video card so expect to have some heat issues. You will need a case with sufficient airflow to keep everything cool. -Not really a con depending on your level of knowledge, but Creative gives no explanations of audio settings which can seem like foreign babble if you don't know what you're doing."," Really don't like the bright red light on it. Totally unnecessary. Got this cheaper from [somewhere else], which is where I've been getting all my PC components lately. Newegg has lost sight of all the reasons that people would shop here above any other online retailer. This place is now rip-off central and only worth visiting to read reviews.",6,8

I started with the driver off the ASUS DVD and rapidly ended up at the ASUS site and tried unloading and loading every Realtek audio driver they had.  Enter Creative Audigy and the SE designed for legacy PCI slots. I needed such an add-on card because the PCIe 1x slot was unavailable on the M5A97 R2 MOBO due to my graphics card and the second PCIe graphics slot (4x) was occupied by a firewire add-on card. I ordered it up from Newegg and got it sooner than expected.  However when it arrived, it was wrapped in bubble wrap with the serial number strip taped to the edge of the bubble wrap.  Some of the capacitors were bent over a little from the rough journey in bubble wrap instead of a retail box. I carefully straightened the bent capacitors and inserted the card.  I put the Creative driver CD in the CD/DVD tray player-burner and restarted. Everything worked beautifully, after registering with Creative using the serial number provided.  It recognized my 2.1 sound system and even updated the driver from Creative's website."," Did I mention bubble wrap? Come on, Newegg, you are better than that.  All of us veteran system builders are loyal to you because you are a straight shooter and are transparent.  Nowhere on the Creative Audigy SE [Newegg] page, did it say ""not a retail product"", comes in after-market packaging."," It fired up flawlessly and saved me an RMA on the MOBO.  Plus it used a legacy PCI slot when I had no more PCIe slots available.

Now when I do it I either get a BSOD or the audio breaks till reboot. 4 years of use.," I use my computer to play games, listen to music (FLAC lossless only), and watch movies. My xonar outputs to a vintage 70s pioneer receiver that has been cleaned up internally. The A channel goes to a pair of floor standing three way speakers. The B channel outputs to an adjustable active line level converter to RCA. The RCA output is fed into a vintage 98 PPI powerclass 2150 amplifier which powers a single JL 12w6v2 in a sealed 1.5 cu ft enclosure. The amplifier is fed power by a 650 watt Antec PSU I recapped and modified for 12 volt output (12.2v output under load). Why did I tell you this? Because I wanted you to know how serious I take audio. With the integrated audio my system sounds okay. The extension on the low end is pretty bad. With the xonar I get sound below 20hz with cone movement down to almost 5 HZ.  On the high end I get sparkling clear sound. When listening to properly recorded symphony music I can close my eyes and it honestly feels like I'm there in the crowd. This card absolutely blows away my old soundblaster 5.1 card.The sound card has given me no issues with compatibility. I'm not a fan of EAX and such though (sounds artificial even with a soundblaster card) but the features performed like they should.The built in software is solid giving you a good deal of control over the card's output.An excellent buy and if you have some extra money you might consider getting the more costly asus card for the upgradable op amps and the improved shielding.

Don't buy it without reading and trash/complain about this card here because you weren't paying attention!This card will have trouble driving very powerful headphones, the amp definitely could use a bit more oomph. Make sure you have a nice headphone amp if you have really big cans. Generally though, folks spending that kind of money on headphones would be getting a proper amp as well. Low and Mid powered cans work just fine.Some of the sound shaping,virtual dolby for headphones tweaks etc don't really sound that great but those kind of tweaks never really do. Just stick with traditional levels and leave the other stuff alone. I see that people are having some trouble with installation in Windows 10 which, yeah, that is definitely annoying if you just bought the card and your running 10. With that said,its just due to driver support and the fix will assuredly come. You could be stuck with a card in Linux where its toss up wether the bug will get fixed.", Great card.

Heard its praises at many a review site.," It gave me no end of problems from beginning to end.  It attaches with both a flimsy and problematic to connect molex to floppy peripheral connector and the one included gripped poorly and basically had me getting regular power notices when I tried to install.  Replaced it with one from my power supply, and then also had to deal with it not sitting right in either PCI x1 or x16 slots, if bolted in.  It needed to be left unscrewed to fit properly in the slot.Once on, it was dropping 80 percent of the right channel.  Something seemingly that hits a fair bit of their customers with no solve.  I tried updating drivers, investigating firmware, scanning through forums, updating to the unified drivers (latest and stable)...which didn't solve the problem through many many reboots for driver installs(Really?  My video card didn't even need a reboot, and I generally had to do 2 per driver update).Overall an unpleasant experience and since its a pain to get those molex connectors disconnected, I'm just cutting my losses and leaving it in the case.  A complete loss of over a day dickering with it."," I really couldn't even tell the difference between the quality coming out of the left and my onboard stuff.  They both were able to handle 5.1 24-bit 48k and the on board didn't have me jumping though a single hoop to just plug in and have my entire logitech speaker system working again.I may have gotten a defective one, but their Asus Xonar DX forum had quite a number of threads of others having the same problem, without any resolution or much notice by the ASUS staff.",1,4

The technology for sound cards really hasn't progressed a whole lot in the last few years, so there really hasn't been a need for newer models. I bought this card because I was looking for a sound card as my Auzen X-Mystique was PCI and my video card covered that slot up.If any of you are having trouble getting sound out of the Optical out, try this: First, go to the Asus website and get the most current drivers for your OS. Go to your Windows Sound Mixer and take it off the SPDIF Optical and put it on Speakers. Then go into the Asus Xonar application and select a multiple speaker setup and select SPDIF Optical. Now test your sound. I had to turn the volume WAY down. The movie I was testing it on wasn't letting me hear a voice track. When I changed it in the Asus Xonar application to Dolby Digital Live, I could hear everything as intended.Mind you, I found the critical piece of information (change Windows Sound Mixer from SPDIF to Speakers on a google search that led me to a particular FAQ page on the ASUS website.

This is a very nice feature because you don't need to manually load in special codecs into every single program just to listen to DTS.  Not to mention, getting them (e.g., AC3 filter) to work is next to impossible too.  With hardware encoded DTS, it made things so much easier to obtain DTS sound without doing much.  You just tell the DS Audio Center you want DTS and that's it, it's there.3.  At $50, you're not going to find any other card that will encode DTS up to 192kHz/24bits.4.  High quality AD/DA converters5.  DTS through SPDIF6.  Awesome sound quality7.  Very nice board layout with good components, doesn't look like it was cheaply made at all.  You can actually hear the  DTS relay line switching back and forth whenever it was flipped on."," 1. The little SPDIF to optical adapter could use a dust cover2. No option to set bit rate from 16 to 24 bits, you can try the setting in under sound->SPDIF->properties, but it doesn't do jack.  Even my old Realtek ALC888 has this feature.3. When you configure the sampling rate in DS Audio Center, it kept defaulting back to 44.1kHz whenever restart the computer.  Also, it won't update the setting under sound->SPDIF->properties to match your sampling rate.  Even my old cheap Realtek ALC888 has this feature.4. Ridiculous popping noises whenever DTS is turned on.  The solution is to uninstall 1792 driver and roll back to 1780.  To guy below, you need to install 1780.  Some fools at Asus probably commented out the codes from 1780 and made what was working to not working.5. To get DTS output through SPDIF line, you have to go control panel -> sound right click ton ""speakers"" and make it default.  Very counter-intuitive.6. No Dolby out but why pay another $40?  DTS slighly > DD"," My receiver is a Yahama HTR-5930 & 5 Onkyo speakers set I got from a local goodwill store for less than $100.  Couple them with this sound card through optical line = WOW WOW.  In summary, this is an excellent card for the price.  I could've gave it 5 stars had they implemented a feature that allows us to directly set from DS Audio Center to any sampling rate & bit rate that we want and RETAINS them after every system restart.

I'd say this card sounds just as good as that one after some adjustment with the equalizer.

I haven't had any problems with (good quality) files producing pops or crackles.It does sound better than any on-board sound I've used.I haven't had any problems with any loud speaker pops like some other people have been saying.," Sounds sort of ""flat"" on regular setting. Any attempt to modify the equalizer results in either very high treble and no bass, or a lot of bass and very muffled treble. Something is definitely wrong with bass redirection.Whenever I set it to use 6 channels, and I'm playing a 2-channel mp3 file, it only plays out of two speakers. There's no sort of virtualization that I can tell that seems to be able to correct this.When I am using this ASUS card and I have HDMI out from my video card to my TV, it produces little crackles of sound and I have no idea why. I tried changing settings, etc, but finally I wound up using a VGA cable to hook up to my TV.

It's not shielded like it's high end siblings (Xonar Essence line) but still sounds fantastic.  I think these are replaceable if you want to go higher end, but they sound just fine to most.Flexible drivers - Can easily configure subwoofer crossover with Flexbass (137 MHz crossover?  Sure - this is more configurable than most receivers), set EQ levels, set speaker output levels, play with effects (they get old fast, but it's fun emulating a cave or psychotic episode with sound playback), and there are additional karaoke settings to play with.  HiFi mode is nice when you want to switch to good headphones (disables all settings / tweaks).Gaming acceleration - this should provide EAX 2.0 compatible emulation for games which use it.Price - being at least 50% less than it's siblings makes this quite affordable."," DTS output - When testing sound, I kept hearing a pop when sound played back.  Apparently the issue is the output isn't kept hot, and every time the system starts playing sound, it initializes the line which makes a slight popping sound on DTS receiver.Lack of shielding - for quieter apps where you have to turn the volume on receiver up, you may notice noise.  Nothing like onboard sound, but it's there.Gaming compatibility - not an issue if you don't enable OpenAL acceleration, but some games will crash since this emulates EAX 2.0.  Again, if you disable this they'll be just fine.Sound outputs too close to each other on the board - if you use higher quality / thick cables, you may not be able to plug in all your outputs."," I'm hoping ASUS fixes their digital sound output in a future driver release.  People on their forums note fixes including keeping a line in setting activated (and maxed), but why get a nice sound card and introduce additional noise just to get it to work right?Flexbass with the EQ is nice, they did a lot to smooth out my Energy Take 5 speakers also sold on Newegg.

Music sounds much better than with the onboard sound on my Asus P5QL/EPU (VIA VT1708S) which has a lot of spurious noise.  Movie sound was equally impressive.  I only tried it with one game (LOTRO) and it worked fine.  The installation was easy using the drivers provided on the web site.  Although Windows 7 64 bit did not initially recognize the card, doing a hardware scan took care of that."," I would have originally said none until I tried the Line In function.  I bought this card to use to digitize my large collection of vinyl.  The Line In on the Xonar DS, however, produces an extremely low recording level, totally insufficient to use for my task.  I have used the same turntable/preamp setup with two other computers with excellent recording level. After carefully searching the Asus forums for information I found a lone thread addressing this issue.  There was no help offered by Asus or by anyone responding."," I tried the DS3D EAX emulation on this card with LOTRO and couldnt tell any difference.  Not an important point to me though.  As some have noted, the card can detect when headphones and microphone are plugged into the front panel jacks and switch appropriately; however when you remove the headset and mic the card must be manually switched back to the rear panel jacks.  This was not an issue with me either, the VIA onboard sound requires changes in both Windows Control Panel and the sound utility plus a reboot to switch in either direction.",2,3

Greater than $50 is just too much for a sound card.Works with windows 7 64-bit and a variety of new and old games. I was worried at first because I've heard of things to the contrary."," Drivers and audio center UI. The drivers aren't as bad as some people make it out to be, but they're still pretty sub par. For example, this card claims it has front panel audio detection. It will detect that I have plugged in a device but when it's removed you must go into the audio center to manually change the audio out from the front panel to the back.Speaking of the audio center the UI is very clumsy. For instance, when setting hi-fi or GX modes it's difficult to know right away if they're turned on at all.Asus customer support is of little help and they don't interact much on the forums but I've gotten decent response times and claims that they would send my issues to the RD department.The reason I was most intrigued about this card was the Direct Sound imitation methods this and the other xonars employ. I was anxious to see the difference between EAX and non-EAX. I haven't really don't notice much of a difference and sometimes GX mode can cause audio glitches."," I'm not really too upset that GX doesn't work completely because I took it with a grain of salt to begin with. Plus, I can't totally fault the card if I don't notice a difference really between non-EAX and EAX (assuming the feature is working as intended that is). The card is still a major improvement.To sum up I think this card and the other xonars (if you can infer the performance from this card) aren't just a few polishes away from prime time for ""average"" users. For those people I'd really only recommend the card if they were really into music/movies and not games. Even then the audio center UI needs a facelift to make it more accessible. For enthusiasts I can't really say one way or the other. If you're looking for a much better than onboard sound for less than $100 get it but be sure to note that troubleshooting will probably be a given. If you're an audio enthusiast then this review isn't much help.All and all I'm happy with my purchase. I couldn't go back to onboard",10,10

Sound quality is really good if you're coming from a weaksauce integrated sound., After fighting with the sound input for several hours and finding no meaningful help online on a way around the issue I gave up and am in the process of returning the card.," I knocked 1 egg because while it did most of what I needed it to and exceeded my sound quality expectations it did not perform the function I purchased it for.I stuck it in my sister's windows desktop and it worked completely while on my Linux Desktop it just wouldn't work. Obviously the Linux driver support for this card is sketchy on using a headset (this headset does work and on other devices it has amazing sound) but for playback of audio it was perfect. So if you have no need of a microphone and are getting this for your linux machine then you'll find this card great. If however a microphone is the main reason you bought this card then make sure you're not using Linux. It'll run perfect in Windows, but I don't use Windows so this wasn't for me.I was able to play a dvd in surround sound but beyond that this card isn't particularly useful to me. I've decided to return this card and try another one. If I can't find a card that looks promising then I might just skip over that and get a USB headset. Honestly I only need the microphone for playing on Steam and the integrated sound on my computer has always had bad sound, especially on the microphone. My hope is that I can find another card with better Linux support.",4,4

Luckily I saved this little guy for my ASRock EP2C602-4L/D16 SSI EEB Server Motherboard and it works great., -- Instructions for setting up the sound card software in order to use S/PDIF would have really helped.-- You have to select which output your using in the software to use it (i.e No auto detect when headphones are plugged in)," S/PDIF PLEASE READ: If you use S/PDIF like me, you have to install and open up the XONAR equalizer software and select the option PCM. Then your card will finally output sound. (The software comes on a disk with the card.) I had no sound and Windows showed everything working fine until, after about two hours, I found that you have to select a box called PCM (Pulse-Code Modulation) in the XONAR EQ software.Pulse-code modulation (PCM) is a method used to digitally represent sampled analog signals. It is the standard form of digital audio in computers, Compact Discs, digital telephony and other digital audio applications. -GoogleAnd as stated before, you have to select which output your using to use it. If you plug in headphones the card wont auto-detect it and switch accordingly. You have to select it in the software. Not a big deal if you don't switch all the time, but just to let you know.Overall, I like this card.

Surprisingly, there wasn't much of a difference in sound quality. The most noticeable change was when gaming and listening to music at same time, my motherboards audio would dim or cut out during bassy notes or explosions. With this card sound stays solid and I did notice a tad crisper notes. The best feature of this card was the Dolby Headphone! This feature is absolutely amazing in games, movies or music that support 3D positioning. Sadly, description states it has the GX 2.5 emulation, but it is infact only 2.0, Gx 2.5 boasted some major upgrades over 2.0 as noticed with my roommates DGX which has it. It also does not have a built in AMP, which I kind of relied on with my Motherboards audio.All in all, if you game, save yourself the money and get the DGX instead, as it has a built in AMP, GX 2.5 and still gives you partial Dolby technologies, most importantly Dolby Headphone.

It's hard to be subjective when you're not able to do a blind listening test yourself, but I do percive a slight difference. I was able clearly hear some detail that was slightly muddled before in some heavily layered tracks.I also use the card to mess about with REAPER a bit, and it's been working fine on 24bit/88.2kHz projects with a 10ms latency. I haven't tried dropping it further, but I'm not needing anything lower at the moment (Side note, the xonar control pannel only has 44.1, 48, 96, 192kHz sample rate selection options)."," 1] It seems that you can't customize the quick DSP modes in the Xonar Audio Center software outside of their default values. Plus there's no quick ""right-click"" menu in the tasbar to change modes, requiring you to open up the control pannel and reset the settings you want.ex. To play a game: open up the control panel > click GAME mode > set to 8 channels > click DH-1 room setting > click flexbass tab > turn on LFE crossover.To play a audio: open up control panel > click HiFi mode > set to 2 channels.This is just a small annoyance, but an annoyance just the same.2] As other's have stated, just be gentle when inserting the 4 pin power connector.",,1,1

9SIA1N82M64384,29-132-020,6/20/2015 10:50:47 AM,David K.,Great Budget Sound Card With Optical Out,4," I came across this card because I filtered through all the sound cards with optical outs by price and this was the cheapest one I could find by a brand that I recognized. Actually, I've always wanted a Xonar. But for my personal build it would have to be one of their top end models. Even though this one appears to be their entry level card. It has a lot of features and really good sound quality. I put this card into an HTPC build I did for my sister. I wanted to make sure she'd be able to get 5.1 to her home theatre receiver. The motherboard I had to work with only had analog 1/8 in jacks out. I also installed a graphics card, which did have HDMI audio out. But her receiver is an older one and doesn't have any HDMI inputs. There was a PCI-E x1, but it was covered up by the graphics card, which was a dual slot card. So I had to track down a decent PCI sound card with optical out. PCI hardware is becoming obsolete, so I thought it might be hard to find a quality sound card that suited my needs. This sound card has impressive quality for what I paid for it. I had hoped to find a sound card for $20. But when the difference in quality is so great between the $20 one and one for a few bucks more. I'll spend a bit more. This card has analog 5.1 audio out via standard PC 1/8 in jacks and a digital 5.1 out via optical, aka SPDIF, aka Toslink. Pretty much any motherboard you'll find these days, that's not too old or dirt cheap is going to have analog 5.1 output. Although, it seems to me that particular format is going obsolete. Some things still use it, but for the most part the vast majority of people on desktops these days are probably using either a simple stereo output, a digital out to their home theatre or TV or wearing a headset. Which often times connects via USB. At this point, I can't imagine ever needing to buy a sound card without some sort of digital output ever again. This sound card supports 96 khz sampling rate. Which is good. It's not the highest, but respectable for what you pay. I tested this sound card on my receiver, which supports all the latest and greatest formats. This card put out DTS and Dolby Digital at 24 bit 96 kHz just like its supposed to. When I hooked it up to my sisters receiver that actually created a problem. Hers is older and only supports 48 kHz sampling rate. So it wouldn't accept the signal from the sound card until I realized what was going on and changed it. Even at 48 khz you'd need a trained ear to detect the difference. 95% of people wouldn't notice or even care if it were set there or at the max 96 khz. Even the latest consoles output audio at 48 khz. Even though the PlayStation has an option for 192 khz it doesn't actually play there, even if you select it."," I had trouble with the most recent version of the Xonar Audio controller software. As long as I was using analog. It worked fine. But as soon as I tried to enable the optical out, it would crash the program. It would just pop up that the Xonar Control Panel stopped responding and I had to close it. Then if I restarted it, same thing, crashed. Even if I opened Windows audio output and enabled it from there it wouldn't work. So what I had to do was go to Asus website and download an older version, which did work. For some reason the optical out is labeled as, ""Optical Pass-Thru"" in Windows audio output panel. Which caused me some problems early on. At first I disabled the pass-thru, thinking it was a feature I didn't want to use. I enabled a different optical out, that didn't even exist. I don't know why it was even listed. So of course that didn't work and it took me awhile to figure out that the pass-thru was what I wanted to use. In fact, I found the info online in a forum about this card. In the end I realized that it was actually obvious as the Pass-Thru was the only optical out listed as Asus Xonar. In all honesty, I have mixed feelings about Asus. They make some of the most excellent enthusiast hardware and clearly some really high quality entry level gear as well. But, I have had some serious issues with their hardware in the past. I had 2 GTX Titan graphics cards from Asus. $1000 each. One of which was pretty much perfect. However the other one had some very sloppy soldering on most of the components. If you held the two cards up side by side it was visually apparent. And eventually one of the capacitors actually came loose from the main board causing the card to become essentially a $1000 piece of junk. Fortunately it was still within the warranty period. But still, on a $1000 piece of hardware, you expect the quality to be perfect. After that, I have been cautious about Asus hardware. Asus customer support is slow and I've heard a number of stories about them denying legitimate RMA warranty claims. I doubt I'll ever buy another graphics card from them again. But I'll still consider purchasing their other products in the future, especially mother boards and sound cards."," In the latest version of the Xonar Audio Control Panel, there's an option to select 8speakers, or effectively 7.1, as your output. Since the latest version wouldn't work for me I had to use the older version which didn't have that feature. So I wasn't able to test whether the 7.1 would work or not. The Xonar audio control panel has a load of features. Unfortunately I didn't really play with any of them so I can't tell you about them. If you're interested in that, check out Asus website to see what all features you'd have access to. That is one of the best things about sound cards opposed to onboard audio on most PCs. The sound cards usually have a lot of extra audio effects to take advantage of. Some of which can be very effective. This card comes equipped with a standard length PCI bracket. There is also an optional shorter one, which I honestly would never have any use for. But if you have a the type of PC with a shorter bracket slot, Asus was kind enough to give you the option. Setup is easy. The PC I installed this card in used Windows 7 64 bit. Although I had to download the older driver version to make the optical out work, this card also comes with an install disc. Installing with the disc is as easy as it gets. When it's done there will be a little blue icon in the box next to the clock on the task bar, indicating the program is running. You can access it there by double clicking it or track down the shortcut in the program menu from the start button or in the appropriate folder in the Program Files (x86) folder. Overall I was very satisfied with this card. For the hardware alone, I would rate this 5 Eggs. But because of the problems I had with the software, I am deducting 1 Egg. I wasn't able to take full advantage of all this cards features, so it gets 4 Eggs. Asus doesn't exactly support this hardware with frequent driver updates. When I looked, there were only 2. One from 2013 and the other from 2011. So clearly this card has been around for awhile. Which isn't a bad thing really, as it has given them ample time to work out most of the bugs. But clearly they still have work to do. Whether it will ever actually get done, I have my doubts.",6,6

It really is so much of an improvement to the enjoyment of any audio source for the money you pay. The audio that comes through sounds extremely accurate to real life. And this will depend on the sound system you own obviously but when a tapping, bumping, piano in the background occur sometimes I get the most mild sense of alert, or even pause the music because it's such a realistic sound. Not kidding, I could see having a good surround sound while watching horror flicks being quite startling. I'm using a logitech 2.1, and they've always had very clear sound but not a very full mid-range. Well the mid-range that the card puts out helps compensate for that. I'm very happy with my audio setup now. I just feel like I hear so many more sounds going on at once now that I didn't hear before and that can only happen when switching from onboard audio as I have found over the years.- Jonathan"," The interface in the software is fine, however it can be very difficult to get the EQ slider exactly where I want it.

I have had this card for over a year & it has worked well in that time. I had a recent build & I decided to put another card in my computer that had the DX card & move the DX card to the new build. The new build had been working fine for about 6 months when I moved the card to it. After the installation when I tuned the computer on it popped real loud & shut down. It would not restart for a couple of hours & when I finally got it to turn on it repeated the same sequence.So I re-installed it in the other computer  that it had been working in & now it popped real loud & shut that computer down. So I RMA'd the card & the replacement does the same thing. So I RMA'd that card & now am having the same problem. During all this time I also was installing the new card(different brand) in both computers & it was working fine. So with the last card when I tried it in the first build it killed the motherboard. I talked to ASUS & they said they would be more than happy to RMA the card.

I settled with the Xonar DX, and was immediately plagued with random channel-swapping (test the front left speaker 8 times and it would play from a different speaker each time) and a terrible POP every time the PC sleeps or shuts down.Downloaded Xonar unified drivers, didn't fix anything. Discovered a firmware update under the Window's XP tab of Asus' website... BINGO! Now the channels stay where they're supposed to. The POP is still annoying - power amps MUST be off before shutting down the PC else it startles us.

Has good potential if you're just starting out with a new PC and/or wanting to experiment with better sound. There is a noticeable difference in the sound quality, albeit not a big one. It's very clear - for what it is."," Bad packaging; one of the capacitors were bent upon arrival. Hardware was easy to install, but software was a pain to figure out - update is easy; don't EVER rely on CD for drivers... instead download them from the Creative website. If you're unfamiliar with software sound settings, this can be a pain when configuring even a basic 2-speaker w/ sub system with ONE plug for the soundcard. Had to look up in several search engines for what other people did until I finally got it to work by plugging it into the green (which didn't work at first), and then finding the right configuration via software."," Be sure to reboot after installing drivers and setting up the right input plug/socket as well as selecting from sound manager which of the 3 devices to run from (that's right, 3; not just the new one that should be there to integrate and process it all for you conveniently for the sake of plug-n-play like with a graphics card). Also - with some tinkering, I did get many programs to work with the card. However, many programs (especially run at the same time, or just in general; i.e. switching from watching media and listening to music to another program such as Skype or playing games) won't work well with it, or you'll hear music, but no sound or voices. You either have to tinker with it a bit, or keep switching between the soundcard and onboard. Might be good for beginners to experiment with and learn the basic painstaking troubleshooting of sound, but the result is barely worth it. A soundcard at all is better than onboard sound (just like a graphics card), but it's more difficult to find the right one for you, and harder to discern a noticeable difference - unlike with graphics, let alone harder to install and to tinker with just to get results at all.",None,None

Where you can REALLY hear the difference is on a decent set of headphones, more than likely due to the higher S2N ratio, cleaner signal due to the headphone amp and lack of interference.If you are OK with your onboard and don't use headphones, you probably don't need a sound card.

You can find my original review by the same name from well over a year ago. I'm not planning on reiterating anything, so you're best off reading that as well.(Posted as XionEternum, but with review changes it should be Michael W. now)Now, what's new to report? Well, as the title would suggest; I have learned a lot more about audio and audio hardware since my original review. First and foremost, this is a hardware internal DAC and amp and little else. It's got a middle-of-the-road DSP that has been around for quite some time now and still holds it's own for the price to this day. If you want ""more"" out of your on-board audio and that audio is rather old itself or extremely generic; then this will at the very least give your sound equipment a bit more punch and remove most if not all hiss.", While in my original review I claimed Windows would push 192kHz to it - and it can if the limits aren't auto-detected - the DSP itself will compress that down to 96kHz which only serves to increase the demand on both it and your CPU which is feeding the DSP the higher bit-rate audio. So you're best off matching the spec in Windows. ASUS software tends to conflict with some games. Case in point; an update to Saints Row 4 shortly after launch made the game crash at launch due to GX mode injecting .dll files whether the mode was enabled or not. I had to and still use a third party freeware driver called UNi Xonar in order to circumvent this problem. I would recommend anyone using any Xonar cards to use this software too as it's less conflictive in most cases.," I still stand by everything else I said. The audio quality value between this and the Arctic Sound P301 (which Newegg no longer carries for some odd reason) is undeniable. It's easily one of the best sub-100USD options available for both headphones and mic.I must however reconsider my stance on True Surround Sound(TSS) vs Virtual Surround Sound(VSS):I must admit, I fell for the VSS for a while until I realized I wasn't actually able to determine front/back origination of sound. I thought I could at first, and the Dolby Digital VSS effect DOES emulate what the sound would sound like coming from an array of surround sound speakers, but with one caveat... It's warped audio coming from a singular source. How can you tell? Well I dare you, any of you wannabe audiophiles out there to really pay attention to the famous ""Barber Shop"" mp3 out there which is recorded in stereo. Find your favorite audio forum and discuss - actually discuss - whether you think the sources you hear are in front of you or behind you at any point. Focus on it and ask yourself whether their sounds and voices feel like they are in front of you or behind you and when they are in front or behind. Here's a little mind-blower for you too: Also ask yourself if it sounds like they could be above or below you too. If you pay so much attention to it you can't tell; you'll start to feel this cone of source representing where the source could be coming from. If not, then frankly you're still deluding yourself. Try snapping your fingers in front, behind, below, and above you. Does the source in that mp3 REALLY sound that distinctively positional? Didn't think so. Now for the flipside... I've not found a single TSS headphone/set out their with sound reproduction quality rivaling even the Arctic Sound P301. We're comparing a 20USD headset with reasonable build quality if simple and minimalistic design and 2 50mm drivers to 100-180USD headsets with 6-10 30-40mm drivers that typically sound worse... tinny... weak... Frankly, all we really need is distinction between front and back, so where are the 4.0 headphones/sets? What happened to quadraphonic? The closest thing I've seen that sound reasonably good is the 40mm driver powered ROCCAT Kave - which I have and like for games, hate for music - and it's successor the XTD which I have not tested yet for fear of the same drivers....Yes... my thoughts are this complex... *cringe*",7,8

9SIA1N82M64384,29-132-020,8/14/2014 9:27:03 PM,Anonymous,Affordable awesome upgrade,5," This card is definitely one of the best value card and most affordable upgradable to your average motherboard sound. Why? 105db snr, dolby headphones (powered by hardware dsp), standard front panel 3.5 mm connector and builtin headphone amplifier. 105db snr might not sound attractive to some people because motherboard sound has improved during recent years. Still a separate card should provide advantages over motherboard because of separate dsp chip and helping elimination of noise. In present era, when creative eax is no more used by game developers, this card can be a perfect candidate for gaming along with music and movies. If you like to play older eax titles very often like me then I will recommend you to buy a creative card instead (preferably sb z). Please do not compare eax performance of this card to creative since this card only tries to emulate that which is not really accurate and well appealing.  This card performs exceptionally great for music and movies and on board audio does not even come close. Dolby headphones will really make you feel as of watching movie in theater. Once again, this is only about positional audio preference. Some people like creative cmss more but I prefer dolby headphones. If you buy this card, you have to play with these options to discover this cards true potential.10 band equalizer is available along along with its software and is very responsive and accurate. You hear almost every missing tone from your previous listening experience. I also own essence stx and pair of hd600. I must admit this card justifies its price very well and somewhat beyond expectations.Environmental presets however (hall,  room, theater etc) are not as good as on creative. Sound quality wise, this card will make your cheap speakers and headphones sing. Obviously it is recommended to use high quality speakers and headphones to see its true capability. If you never had a chance to upgrade motherboard audio or you are still owning x-Fi or older cards and looking for a cheap upgrade, please try this. Be patient after installing and the card will show its quality after it will have its burnin done which may take a while. Initially after installing, it might sound somewhat terrible but with time it will give clean and louder sound."," Asus provides GX for emulating eax but it is not reliable and can cause glitches, sound loops or even game/system crashes. If you play old eax title, they will sound flat but still headphone amp and dolby headphone compliments it to some point. Creative has been the ultimate choice for more immersive gaming experience but sadly developers are not so much interested in hardware audio as much. New creative cards now offer a great value still because they have updated specs but they cost quite more than this card.", So make your choiceCheap and value genral purpose card: Asus Xonar DGgame oriented: Sound blaster z (better music and movies than xonar dg)Music and movies: Asus Xonar DX (superior sound quality)Please note that above suggestions are value oriented since there are higher end and expansive cards out there.,1,1

When that happened  I double checked the drivers and that and everything in Windows was OK, it was not muted and Windows sound indicator even showed sound when playing music or playback on Windows sounds.After physically checking the card I still did not see anything wrong but after a shutdown and just pushing in the power connector which seemed like it didn't move or was loose at all and powering back on it was back to normal no problems with the sound.

Got lucky and got it super cheap that included a rebate. Was TOTALLY worth my waiting in not just gold but PLATINUM...DISCLAIMER: i am not a DJ or a sound engineer (yet) so my expertise on audio is slim to none.I read the reviews about it in how people had issues with the front audio panel. I didn't have the problem (yet). Just connected the HD Audio into the designated slot on the sound card and it'll take care of itself. HOWEVER, I did ignore the disk drivers and just installed them from the Asus website.It took a bit of technical knowledge in de-activating my on-board sound to allow it to connect to the soundcard better. Also, the card required a PCI slot. However, i already have a wireless card (PCI) and a graphics card (PCI-E) on my system as well. I had to move things around a bit to prevent the sound card from completely covering the GPU fan.Now, the good part: Audio QualityInitially, the music and all the audio from the computer was similar to what was native on the motherboard: the only improvements were things were just slightly more clear/crisp.. not enough to justify the sound card...Until I found the Asus software & mixerWith the software, it unlocks the full potential of the card to add effects (such as modifying the audio to simulate an arena or how it would sound underwater) as well as a modest equalizer & a dozen presets.

Just a set of simple controls with many options for mixing, setting environments, saving multiple custom sound settings, etc.GREATLY improved the sound quality of my micropower FM radio station.  One of the few inexpensive but good cards to ship with a low pro bracket. No reason to ever consider C-Labs again."," For the super picky this of course is not true audiophile quality, but if audiophile quality is what you want then you shouldn't be looking at a $25 card."," I'm confused as to why so many had trouble with the installation or don't like this card. This is my second Xonar DG, maybe other Xonars are a pain, but my first one a year ago wasn't and the new one isn't either. For Win 7 go to the Asus DL page and get the driver file, delete any old sound card drivers from the Device Manager, shut down the PC, pop the cover, install the card, close the PC, fire it up and go directly to the BIOS and disable the OB sound card, restart and run the software from Windows that you just DL'd. Reboot again and you're done. I have a barebones PC with an Atom 2700 CPU, 3 gigs of RAM, Win7-32bit and lousy OB sound. I added this Xonar DG and GREATLY improved the quality of my micro FM station. However, I'm still using analog outs which is what I need for my external EQ so I can't comment on any difference with the on board digital or Xonar digital output.To be honest I don't use the external EQ much now.

9SIA1N82KJ4649,29-132-006,6/4/2013 6:50:12 PM,Anonymous,Best Sound Card I Have Ever Had,5," Where to start.  First, I have owned just about every major variant of sound card since the days of the original Sound Blaster 8 bit ISA.  I have since owned C-Media based cards, the Turtle Beach Santa Cruz, Sound Blaster X-Fi, Auzentech X-Fi Forte, not to mention another variation of THIS card, the Xonar DSX, plus my most recent try...the Sound Blaster Z.  So, you could say I have had some experience.  I am not a true audiophile, but I am picky about my sound, and I am a FPS gamer.  When looking for a sound card, you are left with a lot of choices.  Depending on what you want, your choice might be easy.  Or, in my case, difficult.  I want it all.  I want a mode where I can listen to my Trance/Techno/Dance in stereo with no sound processing so my Klipsch Promedia 2.1 speakers can put out the sound they were meant to, and I want the ability to have 3D sound over headphones.  Oh, and I want it with awesome sound quality and rock stable drivers for $100 or less.Don't ask much, do I?In my quest, I FINALLY found what I am looking for.  I thought I had it with the Sound Blaster Z, and nearly so....except for the Z driver issues, such as cut-off Windows start-up sounds and more instability than I care for, plus a slow driver interface.  Creative will NEVER truly get it right.  I gave them chance after chance after chance.Enter the Xonar DX.   What, you ask, separates it from the DSX and DGX?  Why did I not keep that DSX?  Simple...the DSX and DGX don't meet my requirements.  The DGX does not have the sound quality I demand.  The DSX cannot do virtual 3D positioning over analog (eg, headphones)...it requires it to be done via digital out.   The DX meets my demands, but lacks a dedicated amplified headphone out port.  I had to make one trade-off in that respect, but it was worth it.  I now have SPECTACULAR 2.1 audio over my Klipsch speakers...as good or better than the Sound Blaster Z.  I now have very good 3D positional audio, using Dolby Headphone.  I have a Hi-Fi mode (like the Creative Sound Blaster Z ""Stereo Direct"") where there is no sound processing going on at all...just nice clean 24bit/192KHz piped out.  I now have one more thing...rock solid drivers that are fast.Here are the enumerated pros, after having used this card for about two weeks:1.  Extremely high quality hardware.  All solid capacitors.  Neutral high quality DACs, with some real bass behind them.2.  Stable drivers, and I mean STABLE.3.  Awesome sound, as close to audiophile-level for the money.4.  Tons of digital in and out options with basically every Dolby Digital technology supported, which I don't use currently.5.  Highly configurable driver interface.6.  Bundled RightMark Audio Analyzer utility comes with the card, and using a 3.5mm loopback cable (not included) you can measuring sound quality like the professionals do.7.  Reasonable pricing, considering it is $20 cheaper than the Sound Blaster Z base card and is more stable."," Every sound solution is going to have a con.  Some of the cons are going to be related to what it COULD NOT give you, and perhaps what it DID NOT give you yet was promised.I can say with all sincerity that everything ASUS promised they delivered upon.  I discovered no operational annoyances related to how the card was designed or how the drivers are written.However, having freshly come from the Sound Blaster Z card, I do have some comparison-based feature cons that I wish the Xonar DX would come with.1.  No dedicated amplified headphone out port.  You have the choice of unplugging your speaker system, which requires giving your computer the old reach around or using the FP header.  I opted for the FP header, with trepidation, since I was sure I would get a drop in sound quality...I did not fortunately.  But you might.  Depends on your case, EMI, and other factors you might not even have control over.2.  NO JACK SENSING AT ALL.  Plug in the device, and then you will need to know how to use the driver interface to configure it for PROPER use.  Not a huge deal, since jack sensing sometimes does not work right anyway, but this is still a con.  There is a longer learning curve.   Perhaps this is good...it will teach people to read about their hardware more...Other cons:1.  Driver interface (feature-wise) has a learning curve, which really does require you read the manual.  Don't assume you will get the most from this card by simply pressing one of the preset-mode buttons.  You won't.   2.  Card requires a older floppy drive style power supply connection.  Apparently the 75W the PCI-E interface supplies is not enough.  You must exercise care and caution inserting the connector...do not force it in or out.  Insert and remove at a 45 deg angle!  This is how the connector was designed and had folks below read their Quick Start Guides they would not have a power connection issue or broken card.  The card comes with the required floppy connector to 4-pin MOLEX adapter.  I highly recommend plugging in the floppy connector on the card FIRST before you seat the card in the PCI-E slot just to be sure you don't accidentally force it and bend or break something.None of the cons here are deal breakers.  Most of it is FYI, in fact.  Not true cons."," My rig:MSI Z77A-G45 GAMING, v. 17.0 BIOSCrucial Ballistix Tactical DDR3-1866 9-9-9-27, 16 GB (4 X 4GB sticks), 1.5VCore i7-3770KCorsair H110 water coolerSamsung 840 Pro SSD, 256 GB as OS/PrimarySamsung 830 SSD, 256GB as secondary gaming-onlyEVGA GTX 780 Super Clocked Edition video cardWD Blue 1TB as mass storageASUS Xonar DX sound cardASUS DVD/RWSeasonic X-Series 650W, Gold Certified modular PSULogitech G400iOne X-Armor Cherry MX Brown mechanical keyboardKlipsch Promedia 2.1 system and Razor ORCA cansViewsonic AH-IPS LED backlit 27"" display VX2770SmhCooler Master HAF XM caseWindows 7 64 bit OEM SP1",7,7

However, the software was  a pain to download from the site and even more of a pain to uninstall from my system when switching back to my Xonar DX.

I am not a gamer, but I do a lot of audio processing and editing. The old Creative card was not doing the job, especially in XP, and I was fed up with it. This card, though a bit challenging to install, is working great with both operating systems now that it is comfortably in place.Another great feature is the extra SP/DIF output which I have remoted to the rear panel. Just drill and mount an RCA jack to one of those spare rear panel peripheral covers, and connect to the two left pins with just about any two pin header you may have lying around. On the card, there are two pins, a space, and a fourth pin. The lefternmost pin is ground, pin 2 is the the signal. That 4th pin by itself can be ignored. While I was at it, I mounted two more RCA jacks and now have an auxiliary input to the soundcard, using one of those 4 pin audio cables we used to get with CD ROMs, cutting off one end and soldering in place. Even without the rebate, this is a very good card, despite not having a SP/DIF input. Highly recommended.",2,2

9SIA1N82M64384,29-132-020,1/11/2014 1:37:02 PM,Richard R.,Excellent value for improvement over onboard audio but some caveats.,3," First of all I must say that at this price point this card outputs better quality sound than anything else. The headphone pre-amp powered my ATH-M50 headphones superbly, bringing out more details than my motherboard's onboard sound (on a new computer I built last year) or my old soundblaster audigy pci card. For optimal sound quality I need to change the preamp setting to boost the ohms >64 which is far higher than normally specified for my ATHs. Now the ATHs require lower ohms to drive them than most other high end monitoring headphones. So if you headphones require higher ohms the preamp may be under powered (?). Worked perfectly for me though. :)"," The main reason I bought this card was to have better sound quality over my headphones while both recording and singing karaoke live. The side of the box touts karaoke functions.Unfortunately though, the card doesn't support live monitoring (i.e. hear what your inputing into the card in real time). Sure you can enable monitoring, but it noticeably lags to the point it's disconcerting and makes it entirely useless for karaoke or sound recording.  Disappointing when my 10 year old Soundblaster Audigy supported this flawlessly. I was going to RMA this card but after restocking and shipping fees my refund would be too little to be worth bothering. Understandable at this price point. Still for general sound quality this card is a steal, so I'll be putting it in my dad's old computer with sub-par onboard sound and purchasing a different card for my use. The drivers aren't the greatest but you can download improved ones made by a 3rd party. Just google Xonar Uni drivers. There's an accompanying replacement interface called xonarswitch which allows you to make different sound profile you can switch between, which is very useful!! xonarswitch is in beta though so make sure you have a system restore point created before installing just in case."," If you're in need of a cheap PCI soundcard (interface which is often absent in newer computers by the way) with good sound quality for powering your high quality over the ear headphones, this card is a solid bet!! The lack of real time monitoring is really my only major caveat, which probably won't matter to most people one bit.",1,1

9SIA1N82KJ4649,29-132-006,2/9/2013 3:36:00 PM,Darren U.,Awesome card,5," I was uncertain how much better this would sound than a pretty recent onboard audio chip (Realtek ALC892), but I'm sold on it now.  Listening with a great pair of headphones (Sennheiser HD280 Pro) it's a clearly distinguishable improvement.  It's a matter of clarity and crispness of sound.  When listening to music through the onboard chip there was a slight amount of static in the background, which was clearly audible during quiet portions of the track.  This Xonar card eliminates this static, and provides a silent audio floor.In general, sounds are much more precise, from the lowest frequencies to the highest.  Sounds can be much more clearly separated; bass becomes a clean and nuanced part of music as opposed to the dull background boom it can be with lower quality audio cards and headphones/speakers.  Is the difference dramatic or worth the price to you?  That would depend on how much you value the quality, how closely you listen to music and movie tracks, and other personal factors.  For me, since this PC is my primary source of music and I spend a great deal of time on it there's value in it, particularly since I expect to keep this for a while.There is a front panel audio connector, which many cards of this quality lack.  It's a low profile card which includes a low-profile bracket in the box.", No major cons.," It requires a floppy power connector, though the box includes a MOLEX to floppy adapter.  I used third-party UniXonar drivers, which installed in Windows 8 64-bit without a hitch and seem to carry less installed baggage than the ASUS driver package.   For compatibility with newer systems which are starting to phase out ""legacy"" PCI I chose this PCI-express version.  As with any high quality audio card you'll need to invest in headphones and/or speakers of commensurate quality to fully appreciate the sound quality.",6,6

There are lots of options in the interface program to get your music, games, and everything else sounding just the way you like.Comes with a ""low profile"" bracket, which is useless to me, but I'm sure many people will find such a thing handy!"," I experienced 2 key problems with this item (both of which were surmountable, but annoying)1) Driver install seems poorly programed. It pops up a background image, and then your usual End-User License Agreement window that you have to agree to in order to continue... except that it never showed up (or rather, flickered up for a split second) so I was sitting there staring at the background for a good five minutes, thinking the program had crashed. But Alt+Tabbing revealed the EULA hiding ""behind"" the background image, so I was able to click it and continue.2) Microphone was NOT on by default. You have to go into the control program, and go through a mini maze of button clicks to find the mic options and activate it manually. This might be in the expanded instructions, I'll concede full ignorance as I didn't bother reading the included PDF.Between these two issues, I took off an egg."," Neither a pro nor quite a con, but the mic option is REALLY sensitive. I have noise-canceling headphones with an attached mic, and I never had the problem that I'm about to describe (when I was using on-board audio): Once I got the mic working, it was picking up my mouse-clicks and keyboard taps at sensitivity/volume level Five. Out of ONE HUNDRED!Turning off Mic boost helped a little, but if I want people to hear me in games or online chat or what have you, they're also going to be treated to annoying clicking and tapping sounds unless I turn my volume down so low that I'll have to yell to be heard, which I feel is a bit counter-intuitive.Also, if you get this and hear something rattling around in the box, don't worry, it's just a couple loose bracket screws =)Don't let the relative length of this and the ""Cons"" sections compared to the ""Pros"" dissuade you: This IS a very nice product and worth the money, it just came with a few minor annoyances I had to figure out.",1,1

I plugged one in and the connection it made was loose.  Once powered up and drivers installed, the card only managed to make quiet and garbled noise: a symptom of not having the additional power connected.  I tried all the floppy connectors my power supply had and a couple molex->floppy adapters and none of them worked.  No damage was visible to the connector on the card so I don't think mine was defective -- just a bad design.The solution was to take the molex->floppy connector that shipped with the card, cut out a small piece of a business card, and force the connector in place with the cardboard just underneath the pins on the card.  Once that was done I wrapped the whole thing up with electrical tape.  After this was done, I'm getting a good connection and it sounds great.",,1,1

Well, after searching online for a while, I found a post stating to use a 3rd party tool to remove all traces of the Asus drivers in safe mode, then power down, pull the card out, re-insert, boot normally and then run the driver setup with 'run as Administrator' - finally the driver installed completely.  Once the driver was installed, I still needed to launch the Xonar Audio Studio and check a box to allow it to direct sound out the optical port.  Also, the default playback device needed to be selected to be the digital out - why do we need to do this in 2 places?Running Win7 x64",1,3

The noticeable difference is the lack of distortion at peak volumes. The software features some virtual surround sound emulation which is great for gaming but my favorite feature is the system-wide EQ.I think this card is perfect for anyone that has a decent pair of cans and wants to get the most out of them without breaking the bank on an O2/ODAC setup or anyone that has hissing or unbearable onboard audio.",1,1

Their speakers, MP3 players and Soundblaster cards have served me well. Making good sound cards sell is tougher these days, since most people's audio needs are available in onboard audio included with the motherboard. But this sound card does stand out. Its ports on the back allow for older analog connects AND digital, which is good. Sound quality is nothing less that what you'd expect from Creative, absolute brilliance."," The firewire port is nice to have, although I've never used it. Not much point when USB 2.0 is around. The card's software and drivers can be a pain to set up. Creative has the habit of selling ""software suites"" on CD along with its audio products. Sorry Creative, I don't want to use your MediaSource player. I'll take your EAX console so I can adjust my surround settings, but all the other belly whistles you can keep. Getting a Creative  product, it's a good idea to download any drivers and firmware updates directly from their website. The downloaded versions are not only more up to date that what the product is packaged with, but tend to be cleaner without all the sugary graphics."," I've been using this sound card for about a year now, in conjunction with a 5.1 Klipsch set of speakers. It's a great choice for those who want the ""room filling"" audio experience for their music, or who want to watch movies on their PC, or who like to play video games. Or all three!

Recording at 24-bit at 96KHz makes sound very clear, even low-amplitude recording.  The card was easy to install as well, short of finding a screw (this is typical of OEM products)."," The sound drivers are buggy.  After anywhere from 3 to 5 hours of continuous play, the sound all of a sudden cuts out and stops.  All playing has to be terminated and restarted, but it'll happen again after another 3 to 5 hours.  When the sound cuts out, there's a fairly loud very low-pitched sound (about 70 Hz) that fades away.  The audio programs play just fine, but without any sound produced.  After 12 hours of operation for one day, this occurred 3 times."," The 600 MB hard disk space requirement is wrong.  Even a full installation doesn't pass half that, more around 250 MB, and you have the option to install just the driver only, which shouldn't be much more than 2 MB.

Creative makes several lines of cards that are much more expensive, but having studied electronic engineering and spent hours reading the technical specs on all their cards, I really don't think that whatever capabilities their more expensive cards have rate for their insane pricing.  This card is MUCH MORE than enough to blow onboard sound out of the water, as well as sound quality from most other soundcard manufacturers.  I may not agree with Creative's tendency to massively overprice some of their other products, and prey on consumer assumptions that the product will perform better, but one thing is for is for certain. Creative makes the best sound cards out there.  Also, this particular card is more than enough to make most any audio enthusiast drool.  If you're into spending 5x the money for a few little quirks here and there that won't really make much of an improvement on audio quality, feel free to buy one of their more expensive"," The driver support is pretty good, but could be better and a bit more comprehensive, stable, and use friendly.  Still, since they make the best product out there, i'll give them a break and let them keep their budget on their hardware development."," Beware of their higher priced cards without much improvement in audio quality.  Some of the higher priced cards even have less audio quality.  The main area I could see them improving in, would be adding onboard memory to their cards to take more load off the system, which would, in effect, speed up overall performance, not increase sound quality.  Some of their latest cards have actually started getting some of its own memory, but that pretty much increases the price by a factor of five, without really increasing the sound quality.  Basically, I view anything inbetween that card and this card as a waste of money... and the price they charge for the only card I would consider as an  ""upgrade"" is absolutely rediculous.

The Control Panel is much more streamlined compared to previous cards/drivers. I have it plugged in 'legacy' style 3 analogs to a Klipsch Ultra 5.1: I have one that still works!!! :) I know a lot of previous driver issues were related to switching back and forth from game mode to entertainment to create modes (all of which are gone now).

Unfortunately, Asus no longer sells them otherwise I would have bought another one. For months I have been trying to find something which compared. I first tried the XFI Titanium which was good in gaming but not for music. I then tried the Recon 3D and not only was that under powered the music playback was very poor. I then finally decided to give this one a try. After I set the equalizer the way I like and played back a song it nearly brought tears to me eyes. If someone blind folded me I would have sworn that this was my old Asus Xense card. This card is unbelievably powerful especially for not needing an extra power source.

9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,12/5/2012 4:27:28 PM,Travis K.,Glad I Got It,5, Good features.  Great audio quality.  Drivers on Windows 8 64-bit work properly.  Software for the sound card doesn't use much RAM in the background.  Compatible with front panel audio connector on my Corsair Obsidian 650D case.  Pretty-looking.," If you have a computer that is lit up predominantly blue, you might be in for a surprise as this has a bright red LED.  Even though my machine's inside is entirely blue, I still like the red LED.  The subwoofer crossover feature works, but not quite how I thought it would."," I have the Edifier S550 speaker system.  I was skeptical about getting this sound card, and I even thought myself that I was crazy for spending over $100 for a sound card.  Glad I did.  I was expecting only a small difference, but I was really looking for in improvement in sound, especially with the bass on my Edifier's.  (I thought the lows were lacking with the onboard audio)  I've always thought the quality gap between onboard sound and a dedicated sound card has become smaller, but let me tell you, there's a HUGE difference between this and the Realtek HD Audio onboard my Gigabyte Z11X-UP4 TH motherboard.  This soundcard puts out a lot more bass to my Edifier's, and the audio really brings them to life.  Not only that, but the audio is cleaner, adjusting the equalizer doesn't make the audio fade in and out as badly.  You can also crank the sound up significantly louder.  There was barely, and I mean barely enough room for this sound card to fit in the PCIe x1 slot below my NVIDIA GTX670.  There is a fairly bright red LED that comes from the sound card.  When your computer is already lighted like mine is, it appears more of as an accent light, but it could be fairly bright if no other lights were in your computer.  Anyway, I definitely recommend this card if you feel like you're not getting enough from your onboard audio.",7,7

9SIA1N82KJ4649,29-132-006,6/7/2008 3:14:18 AM,Craig S.,Wow,5," This card was an amazing step up from the onboard sound on my Abit IP35 pro. Even on my modest PC speakers you could tell the difference immediately. Music playback was much sharper and had a clarity that the onboard sound did not, tones tended to not blend together and become muddy as they did with onboard audio. 3d audio in games works much better as well, again this card lends a precision to the audio presentation not found in the onboard solution. Setup on Vista was painless and the card and its features worked without having to tweak the install at all. My package also came with a molex to floppy converter, asus may be packing those in standard now as well."," None for me. The sharing of the mic input in the back with the SPDIF may be an issue for some, but I use my mic through the front panel audio connector. Very little featurewise is explained in the manual and not everyone likes pokeing buttons in the software to find out what things do. I like having a printed feature refrence packaged with hardware personally."," This is hands down one of the best sound cards I've purchased, especially when you factor in the price/performance. It wouldn't shock me to find out that this card would hold its own against its pricier competition.

UT3 does not crash as with X-Fi in HW OpenAL but UT3 is where the environmental and/or echo/reverb is overdone or low quality.The dobly virtual Headphone and virtual speaker (3d sound dsp) modes seem worthless -- as it sounds as if you are in a small tile room filled with water.  Perhaps some other game configuration is needed. I bought some higher priced sound cards in the past and I didnt think the sound was all that great in games.  The Asus DX seems better but for the Environmental/Echo/Reverb.," Oblivion crashes in a sound card dll soon after gameplay starts if DS3D GS 2.0 buttion isnt unset in the control panel applet.A managed direct sound application I compiled crashes or hangs.  It might have bad parms/bounds it doesnt check -- but it works with X-Fi.  An XNA app did work.Previously mentioned Environmental/Echo/Reverb quality issue.

Do not have to use an extra program just to get surround sound in D3d games.I am using this card to replace an Xfi pro card. I originally thought all my game crashes and instability probs were because of the new Vista OS. After a lot of troubleshooting and forum reading I narrowed it down to my sound card. **continued in other thoughts.**, None. I highly recommend this card for gamers using windows Vista.," I had no problem in switching cards. I was already ill about having to use Creative Alchemy with my drivers to get surround sound in my ""older"" games. Plus I had constant crash to desktop (CTD) in other games such as Unreal 3. I have now installed this card after a clean reinstall of my system. Unreal 3 does not CTD, all my ""older"" games run with the correct sound without having to set up an additional program (ex: Half Life 2 series, Oblivion, etc), and my system feels more stable. I actually like Vista now. The sound quality is about the same as my XFi card which is a good thing to me because I did not have an issue with the quality of sound with Creative but I did have an issue with the quality of their drivers. Also I am using the Xonar with an EVGA 680i Nforce mobo with no probs, but I am not sure what my Bios version is.System: EVGA 680i mobo, Quad core Q6700, 4 gigs ram, BFG 8800 ultra, Vista 64 OS.",3,3

I immediately noticed a difference in sound quality over sennheiser headphones. The sound is much more crisp and the surround adds the effect of a much more realistic field of sound. Can't beat the price either. Runs off the PCI-e 1x slot so I have room for additional cards on a micro ATX motherboard with a 2 slot video card. Drivers and mixers installed in less than 30 seconds.," It's brand new so internet based support is pretty much non-existent. Needed to install a CD-ROM to install the drivers. The PCI-E 1x slot doesn't offer much support for this card, needs a sturdy case.

Also has the option once you enable dolby headphone to take it another step further and click the 7.1 virtual surround check box.

It actually makes me glad that i fried it because otherwise i would have never bought this. Newegg needs to list DD/DTS in their specs for this card.  DD is a major selling point for a lot of people.  I have a high end motherboard and enabling dolby headphone blows away on board.  Without that enabled id say its about the same.

It's overkill!I could list so many more.  Basically, you need to buy this.  Let me reassure you, the jump from onboard sound to the Asus Xonar DG is a lot more significant than from upgrading from a Asus Xonar DG to a $200 sound card.  Don't look any further and grab this even if you do plan to get a high-end sound card down the line.  This will take the place of your sound card for a long time or at least until you decide to go with a $200+ sound card.  The DG has excellent sound quality.  You will be surprised, 100% guaranteed.

The difference is night and day.  IGNORE user reviews that say it isn't a huge upgrade.  A) you need to have great speakers or high quality STEREO headphones.  Not a gaming headset.

I hear things I've never heard before without even trying to hear or listen for it.  Sometimes, I turn around and look behind me because I thought it was sound from outside but it was just a sound effect or instrument in the background that i never heard before.

Please allow me to tell you why.First and foremost, I am not an ASUS rep in disguise.  I am an extremely satisfied Newegg.com regular, who happens to enjoy products like Gigabyte, Asus, and others.- Dolby Headphone.  If you are a headphone audiophile, you NEED this.  It is pointless not to have this feature, but the Asus Xonar DG does.- Headphone Amp.  This sound card has its own built-in headphone amp.  It magnifies the sound.  Ever hated when a game's volume was too low even on max master volume.  Well, you dont have to worry any more.  - Smart Volume- 7.1 virtual/simulated surround sound.  I don't care for this feature but some do."," (PROS Continued....)There are so many features that you can tweak and mess with.- In 7.1 virtual surround sound, you can place where you want each sound (speaker).  You can have the front speakers to your side, or behind you.  Any combination.  Just click and drag each speaker and subwoofer anywhere in your virtual room.  I think this is a very neat feature.- A huge upgrade over onboard sound.  I have a newer motherboard so my onboard sound is one of the best of onboard sound out there.  HD Audio.  When I got the Xonar DG, I was amazed of how much it improved sound quality.  It's like NIGHT and DAY.  I'm not exaggerating.- Those that say that it isn't a significant upgrade over their onboard sound are misleading.  That isn't possible.  It's impossible.  And they need to be honest.  I am 100% sure they did not tweak the sound (equalizer, etc).- With that said, buy this if you cannot spend $100-200 on a sound card.A must buy for stereo headphone audiophile users."," My Specs (for reference, to compare)AMD Phenom x4 965 BEAsus EVO SLi MoboG.Skill Ripjaws DDR3 1333Gigabyte GTX 460 1GB SLiCorsair TX 750 PSU, Western Digital 640GB HDDAsus DVD driveNZXT Apollo caseAsus 26"" 1920x1200 res monitorAsus Xonar DG 5.1 sound card (Very happy with it!)",2,3

At the time I am writing this article, I just installed this card and have listened to some classical music using Grado SR80. Before that, I had been using Creative eXtreme Gamer for a while, and Xonar DG is far superior than the latter. I particularly like the option for me to choose from different levels of AMP, <32ohm, between 32 and 64 ohm, and >64ohm. I can tell a definite difference using all three options, and the middle one is the best!I will test my Xonar DX and also D1 against the very inexpensive DG and maybe write another review to compare them!",1,1

I have the audio from my 360, PS3, and Roland drum kit running into my sound cards, so this was important.  Absolutely no interference with the DG's line-in.  As stated above, EQ and EAX effects also apply to the line-in signal; a feature very few cards out there have.  Most just allow audio pass-through.  So I'm pretty psyched about the DG.I just can't believe what appears to be a stripped down version totally holds its own against the more expensive Xonar cards, or any of the others I've mentioned for that matter.  For a 2.1 or 5.1 setup, there's little reason to go any other route.  I'm not an audiophile; more like an audio aficionado.  And I highly recommend the Xonar DG.",13,13

A minor issue I did have though is that this card is geared towards headphones yet the drivers are set to external speakers by default. Just make sure you set it to ""Headphone"" under ""Analog out"". Also, don't forget to set the proper impedance as well. Once you do these two things you'll be amazed how well things sound when compared to on-board."," This card was essentially my introduction into the sound card world. Initially, I assumed sound cards were a waste of money. I ignorantly assumed they were equal to buying expensive cables when cheap ones work just as well. However, given the price of this card I decided to give sound cards a try and I'm glad I did. I couldn't be more happy with my purchase; the difference really is amazing.

The problem is you can't tell it how much boost. On my integrated sound I could change the DB levels 10-30 with the microphone. The features it does have are focused on headsets. It does not have any features for speakers like the Xonar D1/DX has. It's focused on headsets., If you were allowed to change the microphone boost 10-30 I think this would be a solid VOIP audio card.

This is the entry point for decent audio boards, and the Xonar DG meets or exceeds the performance of other cards in this price range. I use headphones exclusively on this machine, so the headphone amp is a plus. I had no problems installing this card on Windows XP SP3, and the latest drivers were already on the CD. At the time of this writing, there was nothing newer at the ASUS website. I have always been somewhat leery of fancy driver UI configuration controls, preferring to use the regular Windows configuration tools. However, the control panel for the Xonar DG is nicely laid out, and rather easy to use. It took me a while to figure out some of the nuances of the mixing panel, but once it's set up, the big volume knob is all I really need. And the defaults are sensible, which helps out of the box. I love the Hi-Fi switch to turn off all the audio processing gimmicks for pure, clean audio when I want it. Click again, and the presets are back."," Nothing serious. The noise level is within specs (I checked). If you record silence using Audacity or other audio editor, you can check the A/D converter noise levels without any outside equipment. While the noise floor is at least 100 dB down at all frequencies, the noise floor is not ""clean"". It seems to be dominated by static-y digital noise, instead of smooth white noise. Maybe that's what you get when you buy the Xonar Essence.  Most of the time, the room noise or CD dither will swamp out the Xonar A/D noise. At -100 dB, you're just not going to hear the noise floor, unless you crank it so high your ears bleed."," This isn't really the fault of ASUS or the Xonar DG, but I was a little disappointed by the Dolby Headphone processing. I was rather hoping it would be more like the simple cross-channel mixing/delay that some audiophile headphone amps use to move the sound out of the middle of your head. Instead, this sounds more like I stuck my head in a bucket. Dolby evidently is trying to encode the 5.1 surround into the headphone space - which is fine if you have 5.1 source material - maybe. Dolby Headphone is good for adding some interest to monophonic or synthetic sound, such as MIDI, or maybe some games. With good quality sources, it just seems to muddy the sound. Maybe if there were more configuration, Dolby Headphone would be more useful.",1,1

Even though I'm using $20 Sony MDR-v150 headphones, it drives them 100x better than my Realtek audio did.- Puts out a ton of bass, especially if you fiddle with the EQ.- Dolby Headphone works great on some media."," I had A LOT of trouble installing this card. Whether it was my case, my fault, or the shape of the card remains debatable. The card must be pushed into the mobo. slot absolutely 100%. If you see a slant where the gold notches are on the card, be prepared to reinsert the card several times and potentially re-install your motherboard (I had to). I never had this problem with installing my giant ATI Radeon HD 4670 card. The card will not fully detect itself until its installed PERFECTLY. Windows would detect it and the Xonar DG drivers would install (sometimes), but I never got any audio and upon reboot, the card would fail to detect. On a different note, Dolby Headphone seems to impose some sort of strange delay/echo effect that's quite noticeable depending on room setting you set it to.And I still have to use ASIO in FL Studio. Ah well."," I bought this because I grew very sick of my audio clipping/distorting and my Creative Gigaworks T20s doesn't amplify anything you plug into its headphone jack, unlike my old Altec Lansing MX5020s. What I got was a device that was cumbersome to install, but well worth it in the end. No noise or distortion. Just clean, clear, pure audio.This is a GREAT budget card.

I had a different sound card and could not get the drivers to work for the life of me. Asus's drivers were very straightforward and easy to use. The Xonar Control panel gives a lot of nice options too for the card. I have a 2.1 system set up with a microphone. I should note though that to get the microphone to work you need to set the recorder to the back panel and not the front panel in the settings and make sure detect is on (this makes sense when messing around with the settings). The sound is great (so much better than onboard garbage). It is nice and crisp in games and with music. You hear things you don't with onboard and there is no electrical interference., None so far., It takes the audio processing off of the system cpu and produces much better sound. I highly recommend if you only use headphones or have a 2.1 system and have no need for Asus's higher end cards. I do still recommend the Xonar cards though even if you choose to get a nicer one than I did.,1,1

The difference in audio quality between this little card and my board's chipset really is amazing. I usually use a pair of Numark studio monitors for output, and frankly I'm appreciating my music in a way I couldn't before. The most telling fact I can disclose: for the first time I DON'T have to play with the equalizer. Music and games sound rich and true with all the levels flat. Beautiful.For the $23 it cost me, this card is phenomenal and all I will need for the foreseeable future. Few people actually need 7.1 channel output; 5.1 is perfect.

This soundcard is leagues beyond any generic on-board audio found on most motherboards. I doubt it's better than the dedicated audio on some, like AsRock using Creative SoundCore3D; ASUS using Supreme FX; or even Biostar using Puro Hi-Fi. If you get any of the above, you won't find better sound until the dedicated ~200USD price bracket. So, choose wisely. If you already have a motherboard without dedicated audio beyond the generic Realtek chipsets, then this is an affordable start.Excellent audio reproduction and EQ tuning, even FlexBass crossover tuning. 8 channel reproduction (still 5.1 output but offers 7.1 virtualization), Dolby headphone mode instantly turns Stereo headphones and headsets into believable surround sound systems. I will admit, the sound is a tad crisper than I'm used to. I don't have reverb enabled, but I think there is some by default with Dolby Headphone mode enabled. It's not something I can't get used to. Feels odd, but sounds better I think.Has a mic boost function that is extremely powerful. I find myself leaving it off and letting my mic sit at 100%. It's there if you need it though and extremely clear. There is no distortion when using mic boost too.Does feature AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancellation), however... (see cons)VocalFX looks like fun to play with but I haven't tried to yet. Lots of modes and options for tweaking your outbound voice in either games or apps. You can even setup custom profiles per game/app.Last but certainly not least is that it also has impedance adjustment for three levels: <32ohm; 32~64ohm; >64ohm. This will only enable for headphone mode though.Couple of points of interest:1: You will want to open Windows Sound and turn your bit and sample rates up through that. Not an available option in the Xonar Control Panel. I'm at 24-bit/192khz Yes, higher than the soundcard is rated. Sounds fine.2: You will want to enter your BIOS after installing the card itself, then just save and exit. If you don't, it may not be detected right away. If it's still not detected after that, then reset your CMOS."," My ONLY and I do mean ONLY complaint, is that turning on AEC will disable ALL other functionality. The on-board Realtek chipset from my old ASUS M4A79 Deluxe (now retired) had the same functionality and didn't disable anything else when using it. Hi-Fi mode does this too, but it doesn't sound any better than without anyway."," Now, I've recently given up on the Arctic Sound P531.Not because it wasn't excellent sound, quite the contrary it's fantastic sound. No, I gave up on it because even with the adjustments I've made, it's semi-aural or 'on-ear' design continues to cause soreness where my glasses go over my ears. (See reviews by ATI IS KING!!! and XionEternum on the P531). So, since Arctic Sound has impressed me with their quality audio reproduction at the low-end price bracket (which many of us are shopping these days) I've decided to give the P301 a try knowing they were Stereo and 'Over-Ear' and needed a decent soundcard to make them 'sing'. The ASUS Xonar DG PCI soundcard with the P301 are actually another tier better in sound quality, and two tiers better in mic quality. All while retaining the positional clarity of the P531, yet on a Stereo headset. My impressions of virtual surround have been somewhat raised. I shall repost with an updated review after some time to experience these two together. (C&P on Arctic Sound P301)",12,12

I had heard sound quality was good for the price and a lot of the issues were easily fixed, such as the sound loop and EEPROM issue. This was not the case for me."," I tried for six hours to get this card to work. That's not an exaggeration. I stuck the card in the computer and it wasn't being recognized. I tried wiggling it, removing the bracket, putting it in my other slot, etc. I sent the first one back thinking it may be dead. Got another one, same thing. Knew it had to be something else. I updated my MOBO drivers and finally got the card to detect as an unknown device. Driver software did not recognize the card was plugged in. I tried all the methods to fix this. The EEPROM fix, installing the drivers through Add Legacy Hardware, using the Unified drivers. The only thing I got out of it was blue screen after bluescreen and eventually I had to install Linux on a thumb drive to get myself out of a blue screen loop. The quality doesn't matter if the drivers are absolute trash. Credit to ASUS though, most usually are."," My MOBO is an ASrock Extreme3 Gen3 but I could not find any issue related to that specific piece of hardware that would have caused all of this.

So, when a user selects PCM output for S/PDIF, the Xonar sound card will always deliver 2 channel PCM data through the S/PDIF output port.""With this card you can ONLY select PCM for the output, there is no other option.

So excellent, and so impressed am I... I'm taking a break from Diablo III to write this. This sound card has a headphone amplifier, which essentially allows you to adjust the gain to your liking--making ""quiet"" headphones louder, as well as more dynamic at lower volumes. It has a very flexible software EQ with ""Smart Volume"" (I'm assuming that is Asus's name for loudness compensation) and bass boost. These features allowed me to really tweak the sound quality of my (pretty basic) Sennheiser headphones to sound much, much better--not in a ""it's a little more clear better"" or ""I can pick out the nuances better"" but whoa these $20 headphones sound AWESOME"" better. I feel stupid for not upgrading to this card (or something like it) earlier. If you're a headphone user, and still have onboard audio, this card is for you."," The only negative aspect of this card would be that for it to truly reveal its benefits, a little tweaking is definitely required. I highly recommend, especially if you're a headphone user, to spend some time with the gain settings as well as the EQ to dial in the sound you like."," I don't have a surround sound setup, nor surround headphones, so I can't vouch for the quality there. I also didn't test it with external speakers, as I exclusively use headphones with my PC--but I imagine it would make a similar difference in quality, especially with lower-end speakers that need a little boost to sound their best. Setup was a bit wonky; it didn't detect the card on first pass, a reboot and reinstallation of the drivers worked and added the control panel settings.

The card functions as well as cards with a much higher price tag. I really feel the Xonar DG is definitely one of the ""best kept secrets"" of soundcards. The positional audio is great. Dolby Headphone in conjunction with the Xear 3D 7.1 audio filter sounds wonderful for gaming. Not so good with music, but you should never split music's stereo channels like that it just ends up sounding distant.The low end is a bit loose but that's how I like it to sound personally. Drum kicks are punchy and the hit lingers just enough for me to go ""oh yeah that was a nice punchy kick"". The high end is nice and tight. Very crisp sound there. The card doesn't have much of a mid range to speak of but modern sound has kind of shirked the mid range anyway so pumping up something that isn't really there doesn't do much anyway.", I have no cons for this card.

The Audigy SE was a great card - still is pretty good don't get me wrong, but this little elite card blows the brakes off the Audigy SE, my older X-fi..... I mean FOR CRYING OUT LOUD (literally) I had no idea analog sound could be this pristine from a mere gaming/sound card.I installed it after popping out my Audigy SE. Installed the card and then loaded drivers from the CD - ok on initial setup and listening it was like the onboard sound of my MSI 970a-g46. Low Voume but sounded ok. So i began to toggle things in the Asus UI/Sound control panel. Still no joy after a bit, still the same. I know it must be better than this right..?So then with my old (but good) Grado60 cans (analog out back panel) I clicked on the arrow to bring down the extended menu of the Sonar. Ok so by defualt it was set to 5.1, I changed it to cans (headphone) then i see a little hammer sign off to the right of the speakers selections (that's HP Advacned selection) - then I see the actual 'headphone amplifier' section. It was on default moderate settings raise volume to 80% and its ok, then i toggle pro-gamer mode WOW much better. The I toggle 'exciter mode' and 90% volume, then click ""ok, here's where the fun began.LOOL _ i literally could not believe what i was hearing. It was so much louder, volume, clarity was there. Rumbles. Playing Black Label Society ""Funeral Bell"" was astonishing -- rumbles galore and i can hear the highs and lows. mids pretty well.  Dude my canz is shakin round top to bottom my eyeglasses were cocked sideways on my face. My bag of Doritos were dancing too. I fired up some ambient Steve Roach and was again blown away with the clarity and loudness. Then i fire up BF3 and after a few pops with an AK74 i had to look outside for police to make sure they ain't in my grill. Kidding aside the gaming sounds were also astonishing. It sounds that good.This card is better than the old X-Fi if you take the time to go through all the settings correctly and toggle the correct AMP settings for your cans. Smooth it out with EQ if you like. I also hooked up FP (front panel) to the Thermatake High Definition Audio front panel and it works great and the volume and AMP is the same - exactly, but you do need to re-toggle both front panel and then toggle the AMP again to hear the same volume and amplitude.This is the card to get if you want to use basic analog outs and you have some decent cans to use.

The SB seemed to not output a hot enough signal. This made it hard to hear some dialogue in movies and raised the sound floor due to the fact that I had to raise the volume as a result of the low signal level, increasing distortion and lowering headroom. Well, the DG did exactly what I wanted it to do - that is have a higher/normal signal level. This confirmed my theory about the SB card and the sound seems clearer now too, regardless of the output level. Ok the SB was 10 years old but at the same time, I've never heard such clear audio from much more recent onboard sound either... I don't need the headphone amp since it's for a HTPC connected to my stereo but it's a nice feature for those who can benefit from it. I went PCI because my HTPC basically gets all my old PC parts so I'll probably get a lot of life out of the DG and it was inexpensive anyway... In the future, maybe I'll upgrade to a higher end PCI-E Xonar but for now I'll stick with the DG...I didn't like the fact that the EEPROM was corrupt on arrival and I had to reinstall it.

That is to be expected of course. The application that comes with the card provides several options for any amateur to professional audiophile to play with. The user can adjust their audio channels, sample rates, adjust the mixers, add/adjust several different sound effects. There is also a karaoke setting that allows the user to adjust the key shifts, vocal cancellation, and mic echo. There are FlexBass adjustments a user can adjust to have their bass level and frequency to whatever their desire.I do like the AEC (Acoustics Echo Cancellation). It's pretty useful during Skyping and VOIPing. It does however disable all current settings though, but it does restore them once you turn it back off. The vocal effects only work if you have a microphone with your headset, or a plain ol microphone that is plugged in to the card. It won't however work with a webcam mic. You'll have to change your default mic to make it work with the cardTLDR: Has great basic software to adjust your card playback"," I got the please plug in your xonar card error as well.I wasn't too worried though because I know I wasn't the only user who had this problem. All you have to do is look up on lots of forums to troubleshoot the issue. I did try a USB bootable to fix the EEPROM. When you get in the OS just type ""restoree.exe"" when you get to the front page. When I did that, it said my eeprom was fine so I did a hard reset went back into win7 and installed my drivers again and I didn't get my plug in error that time around.So before you decide to RMA your card, be patient and find the solution first.

Hope he does not work for Asxs. Here is what I have tried a so far: 1- no sound card - HDMI from ATI Gfx card to receiver2- sound card - Toslink to receiver passthrough3- sound card - Toslink to receiver processed by sound cardTest results: 1 = 2 and both are better than 3. What I have found is if raw digital audio data is processed by the receiver alone, sound quality is highest. I can hear all the little details clearly and sound is louder at the same amplification level. At first, it seems to me the sound card may have smoothed out the edginess of the audio, but after many more hours of experiments, i have concluded this is not the case. The only justification with the card is if you need analog output, for example, headphones. Otherwise the smartest choice would be to use the HDMI or Digital Out ports on your motherboard/gfx card and buy yourself a nice DAC and better amplifiers and speakers. Trust me, there is no gain using a discreet sound card.

Before this, I was just using my onboard sound with some Logitech 5.1 speakers. I haven't really played with any of the EQ or other settings. As far as sound quality, I can't really tell a difference with 2 channel sources like mp3s or AVIs with 2 channel audio. Where this really shines for me is when watching movies or playing video games with 5.1 channel audio. All the channels come through very clear, and it's very life-like sound.Sorry to hear about those that had trouble with the drivers and could not get this to work. Just for reference, my motherboard is an ASRock z77 Extreme 6 with 2.40 BIOS. Im running Windows 8 Pro 64bit. I uninstalled the realtek driver for the onboard sound, then disabled the onboard sound in the BIOS. I installed the card, then downloaded and installed the Windows 8 64bit driver from the ASUS website, and everything works perfectly. Hope that helps.",2,2

9SIA1N82M64384,29-132-020,12/23/2012 1:31:51 AM,Karl U.,Great Value,5," If you care at all about audio, but you're on a budget, this card is a no-brainer. For an entry level price, it will be a major upgrade to integrated MOBO sound. If you look at the real-estate on this board, and then imagine any MOBO manufacturer devoting that much space to audio support, you can see the problem. This card solves that problem. The headphone amplifier provides the drive necessary to power less sensitive audiophile headphones, such as my AKG K-501s."," None, really. You do need to install the drivers that come on the CD (or download the latest ones from Asus), because Windows isn't aware of this card. (At least not Windows XP. Newer Windows versions might have built-in support, but I haven't tried it)."," I am an audiophile (not an audiophool). I prefer verifiable, reproducible, science-based results. Sound quality matters to me, and I am a veteran audio engineer, experienced listener and music lover. I haven't used every feature on this card. I use two channel stereo headphones, or feed two channel audio to my Hi-Fi. The stereo sound is superb, but I haven't tried the surround modes, so I can't vouch for that. I am not too enamored of the Dolby headphone ambience effects. It isn't really hi-fi; it's gimmicky. I was hoping for an ""out of head"" headphone experience, but it doesn't provide that illusion. 3D headphone simulation should be very subtle, but this Dolby Headphone effect is like a ton of bricks. I also do not use the spatial ""effects"", or even the equalizer. I leave it in HF (Hi-Fi) mode the vast majority of the time. I use the card to transcribe my huge vinyl collection to digital using the Audacity audio editing tool. Editing with 24-bit audio is really handy, because I don't have to be really fussy about headroom. It's just set and forget. I use Audacity's normalization tool to fix up the levels after the fact. The card's measured noise levels on the line input are pretty good, weighing in at just under 96dB unweighted (which is typical for sixteen bit), measured with Audacity's level meters. The spec claims 103dB, A-weighted, so my measurements are consistent. A-weighting yields better specs. The noise floor is pure analog white noise. There's no whistles, hum or digital whine or buzzing. The quality of your MOBO ground and power layout can affect this too. This is great performance for an entry level price tag.",29,29

I've never had a soundcard before, and having seen the good reviews for this one i decided to give it a try. My verdict is this: it's worth it...but barely. Did it improve music quality vs. onboard? I suppose, mostly due to the equalizer it has, but not by much. the simulated surround sound is kinda cool too i guess. if anything it was worth it just to satisfy my curiosity of whether or not a $30 card could make much difference.

Great quality for the price especially with rebate offer. Software has graphic equalizer which can help (although the sound reproduction is so good I haven't found a need for it yet like I did on my Soundblaster cards). Excellent audio chip. This chip automatically processes and converts audio from a selectable bit rate from 192 khz. I was skeptical at first but I notice that there is definitely a difference when left on the 192 khz with my high end morel speakers. It seems it processes it at 192khz instead of the default bit rate of the media before any necessary conversion. Extremely low distortion (much lower than an Audigy 2 card. Voltage output levels are perfect thanks to the power design., Not really a con: but I wish that the level sliders allowed mouse wheel input to finely adjust levels. No software support for customized environments (but this is not necessary although Creative supports this on the Audigy 2).," This card is much smaller than I expected. I have two Creative Audigy 2 cards which are almost twice as large. Both have good sound quality. I don't like creatives lack of support for a real graphic equalizer for these two cards. However, I have to say this Asus card produces a much cleaner sound. If you want to get the most out of your stereo system, this is a great entry level audio card (at the price). I can only imagine what Asus higher end cards sound like.  I don't really see how others don't give this card enough credit.",1,1

I'm using it mainly for music listening with my Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 speakers with 16 gauge wire for the satellites.  What I instantly noticed was improved localization of the different sounds in songs.  The soundstage is more spacious and open now compared to the X-Fi XtremeMusic, which sounds like bland stereo in comparison.The spatial aspect is awesome in that now, for example, when playing the same songs again, I hear those same sounds about a foot away from the left side of my head, whereas the X-Fi made it sound like it was coming just from the left in front of me and didn't expand the sound much outward or to the side.Imaging is improved with nice separation between the center/left/right, almost giving the impression there is a center channel speaker on some types of music.I am not using any type of control panel enhancements.  These improvements are due to the better DAC and auxiliary components on the board", There aren't really any in terms of sound quality.  Maybe some might not like the presence of the 4-pin floppy connector (4-pin to molex is included in the box) wire slightly reducing airflow in their case...," When you enter or exit the OS, two fairly quiet clicks can be heard.

It has a tiny board that comes with it that uses its own dedicated little slot, at the lowest spot, that does not seem to have anything more than all the connectors and jacks. This Xonar cad fits the only other slot, not covered by my video cards,which is the x1 slot. I was happy to find out there were cards made to fit it. I did not especially want to go with another Creative because I have an Extreme Gamer, (that I have to use in my second computer that uses video cards that only take up one space each), and it did not seem to be a real improvement over my regular Blaster card that it replaced."," Happily there was no problems. The installation only involved pulling off the Video card bridge and dropping the sound card between the two video cards, into the x1 slot.You have to install the drivers off the CD that comes with the card in order to get the  Xonar Audio Center. You can not get the 5.1 to work with windows alone. You have to use the Audio Center to set the speakers, otherwise it will just give you stereo from your front speakers. I know because the first time, I just downloaded the drivers from the web-site and the Audio Center did not come with it. I guess you can load the CD and then do the update."," Before I got the new card, I thought I should pay attention to my current on-board sound so that I could judge the difference later. I am not an audiophile so I can not give a good description of what I am hearing other than to say I heard a lot of ""noise"" coming out of my Logitech X-530 speakers. What I mean is there was a lot of ""something"" being produced that you could call a volume of sound. With the Xonar, you seem to get less ""Whatever"" but I have to figure the loss was of ""something"" that I do not need.

I had originally planned to install a much more expensive card, but after reading every tech review I could find on this card I decided to give the Xonar DX a try, just to see if it would live up to all the hype.  After installing this card, I can honestly say that I was not disappointed.  I was very impressed that a card in this price range could deliver an audio quality equivalent to, or at least very close to, higher end cards.Installation was a breeze, with no surprises.  No driver issues and no unwanted snaps, crackles, or pops."," I have only been using this card for 3 days and, so far, I have no complaints.I've read most of the reviews on here and, while I agree with a lot of the cons that were mentioned, most of them aren't really cons against the card itself.  They are just those things that some of us wish were different, like the included software.  Sure, it could have been better, but it doesn't detract from the audio output quality of the card."," Before you buy, read the spec sheet (and the reviews) on this card so you'll know what to expect and what not to expect...it's all right there.  Everyone's system setup is different, so you may or may not have driver or sound quality issues after installing this card.  If you are among those who are less than satisfied with the performance of this card, keep in mind that there are many other factors to consider before blaming the card.  Take a good look at your system setup.  Don't expect it to deliver something that it isn't capable of.This is a very good card for the price.  It will enhance your audio experience even if you have a simple 2-speaker setup, but you can't really appreciate the 'magic' this card performs until you plug it into a 5.1 speaker system.If you want the audio quality of higher end cards without the high price tag, I recommend this card.",8,8

Some other manufacturers claim their products support Vista 64, however they have never worked properly in Vista 64, whereas the Asus is perfect.  The DSP effects in source engine games are awesome."," No front jack input detection.  You have to manually switch on the front jack.

9SIA1N82KJ4649,29-132-006,11/20/2008 9:48:26 PM,Anonymous,,4," Based on the successful Oxygen chip from C-Media, which means it not only puts out good sound, but the drivers are mature and Linux support is there with newer distros (albeit unofficial and without all the bells and whistles).  I'm driving a set of Creative T20's and they sound great."," Annoying requires a floppy power connector.  Supposedly the floppy connector is required because the audio chip is natively PCI, not PCI Express, and the bridge is what requires the juice.  Asus says it's because the power source is cleaner, but I don't buy it...if that was the case, they'd do the same thing for the PCI version of the card. So yeah, it's kinda dumb to get a PCI Express version of a native PCI sound chip, but I went with it anyways, as it fits in with my ""death to legacy"" philosophy.Card does not auto detect headphones when plugged in, but I don't really mind...just wish there was a way to change the outputs by right clicking the system tray icon, rather than having to open up the entire interface. Missed out on the rebate by a week. :("," On every C-Media based soundcard I've heard, the ""soft rock"" equalizer setting produces the clearest, most well balanced sound.  The default setting is rather bland/flat and most of the other presets sound awful.This card offers no hardware acceleration in games, but Vista's audio model has leveled the playing field and with multicore CPU's now constituting the mainstream, hardware accelerated audio isn't missed.",6,7

Since this card uses the PCI Express interface, it won't be taking up any of your motherboard's precious PCI slots. The card's smaller-than-average form factor meant it was a breeze to install, and both audio quality and the included software suite were top notch. I'm currently running the card under Vista 64-bit, and I've had no driver issues to speak of."," I'm not the biggest fan of the card's combined toslink out/mic input -- I would have far preferred two separate jacks, though this would have increased the card's form factor.

I like to have my speakers plugged into my sound card and my headphones connected to the front audio ports.  This is not an option in the software suite.  You can only send audio to one port at a time, and if you want to change it you need to manually select the port from a list."," I came from an X-fi extremegamer and I enjoyed the smart sensing of the ports (you could plug in your headphones and the x-fi would know that they were plugged in and silence the speakers if you had that option selected).

The sound quality is great; it is a significant step up from onboard sound and just as good, if not better, than an X-fi.

The front end software is completely buggy.  Nearly every third boot, WinXP (32) jacks up the CPU usage to 99%, forcing me to reboot to knock it off, and it's doing it through System Idle Process even after letting the computer completely sit still to load up on it's own.  If I shutoff the software, it's about 90% more stable in games.While gaming, it's much different.  I get snaps and pops at the beginning and end of sounds.  Not in game music, however, nor while playing sounds in Windows.  Crashes and near crashes with looping sound.  Some sounds are way too loud or soft.  And I usually end a game by hanging the system, not quitting.I pulled the card back out of the machine and now it runs like a dream again.  Speedy boot times and completely stable.  I'll be running with onboard sound until I upgrade to a new system soon."," Honestly, I think the drivers are ready yet.

Little to no difference between the Xonar DX and the D2X, the much-higher priced older brother of the DX. 7.1 quality support, optical input (I doubt I'll ever use it though)."," Lack of all the bells and whistles of the D2X, though, this is what drives the price down but preserves 95% of the sound quality of the D2X. Drivers are buggy and the Audio Center is confusing and some features are rather useless.For speakers, I use the Klipsch ProMedia Ultra 5.1 system and I think this thing really gives them the strength they need to perform at their best. However, as I use a 5.1 system, I ran into some difficulties.I initially had the card hooked up to Logitech Z-2300's, a 2.1 system, but, after getting my Klipsch's and selling the Z-2300's, I had an issue with getting the surround sound to work on the Xonar. For Firefox/the web, it would only play 2.1 at first, then sometimes randomly the center channel would work too (but not the rear still).

This sound card is definitely worth the"," 5.1 would work in iTunes though. Then, it would only be 2.1 in iTunes AND the web. I had to re-seat the sound card, uninstall and re-install the drivers before I got 5.1 in all applications. It's working now, though, I'm a little nervous if it'll randomly go out again.This card is exceptionally priced. I had an older M-Audio Revolution 7.1, and upgraded to this. What a difference. The M-Audio sounded fantastic and completely destroyed my on-board audio in terms of performance, but, this opened up another notch of computer-audio fidelity. Along with the fact that the Xonar DX is compatible with Windows 7, it was a worthy successor.Anyway, like I said, I had a bit of a problem with the drivers. But, the sound quality of this card is great. Games sound amazing, it has a high SNR, the Cirrus Logic DAC's are very high quality and music is extremely well defined. Great sound card.

I spent several minutes trying to figure out why my front panel audio wasn't working, and after some research found out that you have to use AC97... it doesn't support HD Audio.  On top of that, you have to go into the audio controls for the card and manually switch between speakers and headphones.  For someone that uses their headphones regularly, how tiresome would that be after a few hundred times?  And given the above, it certainly doesn't support auto-mute of speakers.  -  Static, and lots of it.

And I mean *lots* of static, especially from subwoofer.  -  Inputs are not color coded.-  Needs and additional power connection."," I pulled my old Creative X-Fi Gamer Xtreme gamer card from a prior system and it worked flawlessly.

There are *basic* features missing.Eg: You cannot listen to the line-in input without making it your recording source and losing the ability to use the microphone. This is a hardware limitation.Seriously, I have to go through the sound drivers to switch between using a microphone or watching tv (using line-in for sound). WHY!? All my previous soundcards and built-in sound cards allow this. Also, I had to go through their tech support to find this out, which was not a pleasant experience, you don't speak to anyone who has actual knowledge of the hardware, just a phone-head.What else.. it can often sound louder in one ear than another on occasion.

9SIA1N82KJ4649,29-132-006,12/28/2009 5:34:42 AM,Nik M.,Best in its Class,5," I was reluctant to purchase the DX, even after all the research I did on it. However it turned out to be the best choice. 116SNR for the front two channels (112 for the rest.)  High-definition audio at up to 24 bits and 192kHz across all their inputs and outputs. I was very pleased with the sound quality of the DX, though it is not the best I have ever heard, it is the BEST I’ve heard on a PC. Musically speaking, every note was clear, crisp and had a lot more contrast compared to the X-Fi Surround 5.1 (USB) I was using (and that was better than any on-board audio I have sampled.) The Base is very tight, more suited for Classical Music than, let’s say Hip-Hop. At first it was hard to listen too, with all the extra detail outputted, not being used to that fidelity. But, now I will not listen to music with anything less. It is amazing how much sound you miss from a song or melody with subpar equipment. On this reason alone (crossed referenced with its price) the DX deserves Five eggs."," However, there is a bad side as well. Gaming. The DX will decode EAX, but only up to version 2. From 3-5 it uses an emulator called DS3D GX 2.0, and let’s just say the DS3D GX puts in a good effort. After using EAX for so long, I guess I took for granted the 3D sound it gives, and I can say that the DX is lacking in that department. To produce the 3D Gaming sound Asus does not advertise that is uses two technologies to do this. DS3D and Dolby Surround. The result is over shouting the reverb (even lets say, when you are in a virtual open field in a game, and there is not support to be any echo). Grated all sounds are more crisp, and clear than X-Fi, you still have the feeling you are in a fun-house for sound illusion. X-Fi provides a more realistic exeperience. But if you can live with that, I guess the DX is a gold-find."," The DX uses an Asus AV100 which is the C-Media CMI8788 OxygenHD (capable of Dolby Digital Live & DTS Connect, though the DX only has DDL active.) The DAC for the front left and right channels of the Xonar DX are Cirrus Logic CS4398 (120dB.)  The other six channels use the Cirrus Logic CS4362A (114dB.)  The CS4398 is Cirrus Logic’s Top of the Line DAC. Given all, I must add, because the DS3D is software based, it can be potentially improved on, to a greater degree than the EAX on X-Fi, which makes the only con of the DX mendable with updated patches from ASUS. I hope DS3D is improved on in the near future. Many of the reviews for this product have stated that the DX need for a 4pin connector is a fault. This is simply not true. There is a method behind their madness. Like the DS2X, the 4pin connector is for the card to get the cleanest possible power from the PSU. Cleaner Power, Cleaner Sound. Over all the Xonar DX is the Best sound card in its Class.",17,18

9SIA1N82KJ4649,29-132-006,10/3/2009 12:24:07 AM,Anonymous,A Good buy,5," Driver and software setup was pretty easy. Front panel audio control through software. Clean Sound. Nice Audio Control Center. Lots of options. PCI-E interface. No added static, hiss or artifacts when listening through headphones . Sound leveling on/off activation through software which is probably good for TV listening on a HTPC using the SVN (Smart Volume Normalizaton) feature. I need to test the SVN feature further on some TV programs and maybe some classical music, before I give the feature a thumbs up. I haven't heard any abnormal pops, hiss or clicks yet, using this card. I'm basically gonna use this card for 2 channel listening, so for 2 channel listening, you can't go wrong for the price, features and easy setup. This will probably be the last card I'll buy for a long time. It's a good card that was easy to set up with Vista 32 bit. I was listening to music about 5 minutes after loading the software. The sound is pretty clean. I'm now a fan of ASUS soundcards."," No color coding on the panel jacks. But that's a small con, because I pretty much set it and forget it. It's only been a day and I'm looking for cons, but I'm not finding any others, yet. The outlook for this card looks pretty good."," After plugging the front panel connector onto the card, I can listen through headphones. I switched my speaker setting to ""FP headphone"", which in turn disabled the main speakers through software. Some of the competitor's cards won't let you disable the main speakers through software, period. I bought the ExtremeGamer X-FI card PCI card from B.B., but after trying this card, I'll be returning the X-FI card. This card has a warmer sound to me. My PC seems more responsive, but that may be due to this card's PCI-E over the other card's PCI interface, but who knows. This card like the other card, has sound leveling (basically sound compression) which you have to switch on through software. It's probably a great option for a HTPC. It should bring those low volume levels sounds on TV, up some. I like some of the software features on the competitor's card, but this card seems to replicate most of the features nicely.  It gets 9 out of 10 stars. A very good buy.",2,2

Fairly easy installation & set-up., Manual is almost useless.," What's the big mystery about the power connection?? This card isn't using ""extra"" power from the floppy connector, but the floppy power is its MAIN power. It is using very little to no power from the PCI slot it's mounted in, or perhaps just as a ground return. ASUS went with 4-pin floppy power because power coming directly from the PSU has LESS NOISE than power from the motherboard (PCI-e). Makes sense for an audio circuit, no?Too bad some of you claiming ""High understanding"" don't know simple things like this before you whine.So what's the big deal? Most decent PSU's should have a floppy connection. Plug it in, and get over it.",2,3

It's also the only good sounding card I've used that has front I/O connections. I've spend a lot of money on several other cards, yet I couldn't use the front jacks of the case because they didn't include it.The AV100 chip, is the same chip as the AV200. It only gets a lower SKU and label from manufacturing testing. What surrounds either chip seems to have a greater impact than the chip itself (Even and X-Fi can sound great given a great board design)And it's PCIe x1! I'll never go back to PCI. (make sure you have an x1 slot open and not covered by a video card)"," Dolby was enough until I got a Bluray, where lossless codecs like DTS-HD Master Audio or Dolby True-HD can pay off. You pay out the nose for those capable cards though.Software is pretty, but pretty hard to get around in at first. The manual. It tells you how to put it in a slot in 4,583 different languages. When you find the language you read in, you get depressed because it's nothing that need written about.The only reason I opened it, was in hopes of finding the front panel connection pin-out. Not there. I used my motherboard manual, as it's basically the same on all of them. But to have pins and not include pin-outs in a manual, is shameful."," I run a prior purchased one on Klipsch 5.1 Ultras. Fine to me. One's in the front room HTPC on a really nice Klipsch/ RS\H&K AV/R set and works great there too. I can't imagine why bad volume would be an issue on anything less than not plugging in the power cord. I do believe it's because the PCIe x1 bus only supplies 3.3v and isn't enough juice. Well, either the plug or having your front speakers in the side or rear ports.",1,2

I bought SILVERSTONE SST-FP32-B Aluminum USB/1394/Audio Panel from Newegg and neither the AC97 nor Azaelia connector worked.  I checked with ASUS forum and they seem to think it should be AC97 compatible, but again neither worked and there is no mention of FP connector in the manual."," It needs a direct power connection from the power supply via floppy power connector. Some people might put this as a con, but it is necessary as it can't get as much power through the PCI-express slot. You can operate without it I think, but the audio won't be amplified.  Drivers for the Xonar DX are available for Windows XP/Vista, both 32-bit and 64-bit.  But they been stuck at  6.12.8.1764 beta since 3/20/2009 and development seems to have shifted to Windows 7.

Great sound quality when paired with a decent pair of headphones or computer speakers.More than worth the $80 price tag. May be the best sound card in this price range period. Highly recommended.," None. To some who don't have an extra 4 pin floppy power connection, the connection needed to supply supplemental power to the sound card may be a hassle, otherwise, not a con to speak of.**Word of caution though. When plugging in the 4pin power connector, pay attention closely, as applying to much pressure, or doing it crooked, can push the pin on the card you connect too out of whack. If you DO happen to push the pins out of whack, just gently push them back to their normal position, & attach your 4pin connection. The design Asus used for the connection on the card could have been more solid. But for most avid computer users, it shouldn't be an issue."," For the $80 price range, I think this may be the best card you can get. Phenomenal sound. Easy to install using a empty PCIe X1 slot. Software is pretty user friendly, even for novice hardware ppl. With a high quality set of speakers, or a decent pair of phones, wow. I think this card can even make a cheapy set of speakers/phones sound like a much more spendy set.Having mine running with a 2.1 set of Monsoon PlanarMedia14 speakers, with the 8"" base reflex subwoofer, & the 2 - 9"" dipolar PFT ribbon transducer main speakers, the sound is amazing for a sub $100 card.

This was a significant bump over my onboard Asus mobo sound.  I was playing the new Alice game at the time, in which certain levels you have to find hidden pig noses by their sound location.  Onboard sound with my headphones I could hear if they were on my left or right only.  As I turned my character so the nose went from left to in front of me to my right as far as the sound went it went from 100% on my left to all of a sudden 100% on my right.  Not bad but not immersive.  With Dolby headphone (and a regular headset) I can close my eyes and tell not only that the sound is on my left but close behind me.  Instead of hearing a sound on my left I can now tell that it is coming from 8'oclock and far or close.  With DDL I can use my wireless mixer to get the same 3D sound wirelessly on my astros."," My card came with a bracket that will not fit.  It drives me mad but I have reason to believe this was a rare defect in manufacturing and not a common issue.  My card fits to the bracket at a slight angle, so if I fully plug my card into my mobo the bracket will not line up to be secured, if I move the bracket and secure it, it pulls the card out of the mobo slot.  I can hold it to the case fine enough with a little twisty wire so I won't bother with the hassle of returns.The Xonar software supporting this card comes with a mode called DS3D GX that by default kicks on.  It helps emulate old EAX sound in games from what I understand, it uses a driver that will crash some games and applications, for me it was crashing Oblivion and Fallout 3 without explanation and was tricky to uncover.  It's easy to turn off though, once you know its the culprit."," A couple cons, but I've come to expect that with soundcards.  Your never going to find a soundcard that doesn't cause you some driver problems if you want an affordable boost to your sound for gaming.  You get more pro's than the cons as some of the con's are manageable.  For those looking for a Dolby supporting card this one is great for the price and well worth the money to my ears.",1,1

It also has some voice tweaks to annoy your teamspeak friends with, if they so choose."," The software isn't the easiest to get to do what you want, pretty clunky. The card requires the use of a floppy drive power connector to provide extra power to the card.  I don't have a floppy drive, so this sent me on a quest to locate a 4 pin adapter.  The bracket adapter screws were loose in the box, and they are tiny.  Easily lost.  The worst thing was the drivers and setup.  Windows 7 picked up the card immediately, but the driver software (I downloaded the latest from the ASUS site, didn't bother with the included CD) took at least 4 minutes to install, and then told me it couldn't find the card and aborted the installation!  Several more attempts, even with the uninstallation of the device in the device manager netted the same issue.  Finally had to restart in Safe Mode, uninstall everything and reinstall and then it worked."," This isn't a ding for the card, but for Newegg - I ordered the card on a Friday in the morning.  It sat all day until 6 PM ""Packaging"".  I paid for next day delivery.  Because it didn't get picked up until late for shipping, it didn't make it to UPS in time for next day delivery - which meant my next day delivery was now 3 days later.  If Newegg couldn't make the delivery they should have refunded me the next day charge and billed me regular 3 day.  Ridiculous.  First bad experience with Newegg shipping, but they did a bad one this time.",2,2

Another thing to mention, if your not using your own eq settings, any type of audio you use with this card will sound awful, so you have to take the time to eq it yourself. I guess this is a good thing because you are able to eq it to your taste, but its dissapointing that things don't sound better till you eq it.

Re-seated card; confirmed power connections; moved card to another PCIE slot - nothing was working.  Sound was ""off"" and volume was non-existant - almost like it had no power.  Broke out the flashlight and took a good look at the small 4-pin connector that goes onto the sound card for power and found that the yellow wire's pin was not pushed into the connector all the way.  Pulled it out, bent the ""catch"" on the pin up and put it back into the connector then reattached everything.  Unfortunately I forgot to turn down the volume on my system so when I restarted the system and fired up some tunes it was LOUD - at least I proved the card was working as expected.  :-)Used latest version of drivers from ASUS site, worked just fine (disabled onboard sound via devices as well as in BIOS prior to install).",2,2

So try from the disc first and then update later.Would be nice if the audio ports were colored with the standard port colors instead of all silver, but they're logically ordered at least so it's not difficult to figure out where to plug things in."," Personally I was expecting a larger difference in sound quality, as it was my first time with an audio card.

9SIA1N82KJ4649,29-132-006,4/17/2012 11:39:19 AM,Eric L.,Outstanding Sound Card,5," -Amazing quality of sound.-Completely silent, including the line-in port for mic and recording.-Handles any sample rate and 24bit resolution with no troubles.-Powerful drivers with lots of control (once you set them up properly).-Sounds great with 5.1 surround sound in games and HD movies-Partially takes load off of your CPU, especially for multi-channel sources. Using winamp, my CPU usage dropped from ~25-30% load during playback (for 24-bit 96k sample rate) to ~10-15%. I gained about 10fps in games (such as Arkham City) over motherboard audio.I didn't really understand what silence was until I got this card. Turning up the system volume to 100% yields no noise through headphones at all. Most people wont notice this, but I was really surprised at how crystal clear the audio is coming from this card rather than the motherboard audio."," -The driver software had problems the first two installations that I tried. For the installation that DID work, I used the CD that came with the card to install the older drivers, then updated from the ASUS website.-TO GET FRONT PANEL AUDIO WORKING, YOU HAVE TO SELECT ""FP Headphones"" IN THE ANALOG OUT FIELD. The card doesn't auto-detect when headphones are plugged in sadly, but it's not hard to get used to. Because I'm completely stupid, I had to figure this part out myself. If you can't get your headphones working, then double check you have this selected.-No color coding on the outputs on the back of the card. It has a cleaner look, but it's very hard to know for sure which output is which without looking at a diagram (especially when you're plugging in speakers in a dark room)"," If you set up this card and some part of your audio experience isn't working, it's most likely user error and not a hardware error. I seriously haven't found a real flaw with the card itself, only with the driver software's confusing qualities.For recording, I can plug my guitar right into the front panel audio (with an adapter of course), and there is nearly no noise picked up in the process. I feel like my recording is studio-quality, especially when using the proper software.

For gaming i would highly recommend this card if you budget is around or under 100 dollars ., If you hook up your front audio to this for a head set its pretty worth less. maybe its just the cables my case came with but there is added static noise and you transmit alot of static though your mic so i only use the rear ports on the card and everything is fine  this is why i removed a egg.  It could also just be interferance from all the electrical equipment in my case.  but when useing the front audio with the on bored sound i remember it working like it should witch is why i thight it might be the connector on the card its self. how ever like i said  i just use the rear ports no big deal for me .,,1,3

9SIA1N82KJ4649,29-132-006,12/11/2011 6:36:06 PM,Gerardo P.,Great Sounding Card,5, At first I was skeptical of an Asus Sound Card?  Judging from the specs. I've taken a chance and purchased this sound card.  Did I make an error in prejudging Asus on the quality of sound this card puts out.  It uses minimal drivers to get it running and the sound adjustment interface software is easy to use if not over simplified.  This card just plain and simple sounds great., Not a serious gamer but from what I've heard this card isn't the best for some game titles as it doesn't support some of the gaming sound standards.  As I'm not a gamer so this part of the cards difficiency don't bother me as much as it would a gamer.," Get a good set of speakers for these if you want to experience the great sound fidelity.  I had purchased a set of Bose Companion 20's and these I believe aren't good enough for this card as I can't really appreciate the sound quality as the Bose Companion 20 seems to have some strange behaviour if the audio has too much fidelity not sure how to explain it but the audio seems to fade in and out ever so slightly hardly noticable if your not a true high fi nut.  Just in case you get alarmed this thing is powered by an external molex connector to a floppy drive power adapter.  It clicks because of relays that control the audio input and output inputs I believe to isolate noise coming in from unconnected inputs, not 100% sure but makes sense.",None,None

Awesome software interference, tons of options and menus to play with. - Allows me to use my all-in-one Cambridge Sound-works speakers as my front left and right speakers and a separate subwoofer. They each have their own port on the card, and I set the card to output 5.1, but I used Dolby Pro Logic IIx to move all the sound to the front so it's not trying to powering non-existent rear speakers. -Easy to use crossover frequency slider. They call it ""Flex-bass"""," Just get the D1. And just to be clear, I'll say it again. Just get the D1. It's the same exact card, just without a floppy power connection and a PCI interface. In fact, the card is natively a PCI card, but the DX has another chip to do the PCI to PCIE conversion. Also, with this card (DX), you have to have another cable (the floppy power) running up to the motherboard, so if you really care about cable management, don't get this. The difference between the power coming straight from the PSU (floppy power) and through the motherboard PCI slot is so minimal you'll never notice it in the sound. Also, another con of the floppy connector is that it's only held onto the card with the 4 soldered metal pins. These bend easily. With my Corsair HX650, the floppy power was nearly impossible to take out because of the clip, and in the process, I bent those metal pins and now the floppy power does not seat all the way. I was being careful, anyone could of done this.Just get the D1.", Almost every motherboard still comes with at least one PCI slot. So that is not an issue for the D1. The D1 should come with the same software and similar drivers so hopefully my pros still apply to it.,4,4

ASIO support is fairly well developed as well.OpenAL is supported through the ALSA driver if you have the OpenAL-Soft installed. I recommend using the Oxygen ALSA driver rather than the Virtuoso or HiFier drivers.Note: On BSD and Solaris based systems you will have to disable the native audio stack to allow OSS to take over with it's own drivers and audio stack to load properly.Again a reminder the Xonar series is based off the C-Media Oxygen HD 8788 chip series."," Bought a few of these cards from another vendor (Newegg was out-of-stock at the time) and they did have a bad batch come out of the factory. I had to RMA them back to ASUS directly, but they did replace them with working new models.(BTW... for all the bad reviewers out their claiming Newegg can't help you over defective and bad models, or even damaged packing, Newegg can still help, but if they can't... GO TO ASUS DIRECTLY FOR AN RMA.)Drivers still have a few minor issues on Windows where the right side speakers will lose audio after running applications for a long time requiring a reboot to clear it up, but once rebooted the system works fine.The Media Center Controls are a bit clunky and don't do much, but I rarely use Media Center myself to even notice it, and I did only set them up once and then left them alone."," For two years now I've had this card and it's been great. ASUS makes great stuff, but occasionally a few bad models and bad products do slip through the cracks from time to time, but honestly, all companies have this happen from time to time with technology. You just have to be patient with the product, patient with the vendor, and patient with the manufacturer when things go sour. I've bought and RMAed video cards, CPUs, memory, even motherboards... so a batch of bad sound cards from any manufacturer is inevitable.To date, this is one of the only sound cards I have recommended and still continue to recommend for anyone needing an audio solution for whatever reason.Creative's days of being the best in sound cards is done and over. C-Media is the best now, so if you find a C-Media solution, even if it's not an ASUS Xonar, it's still worth getting.",4,4

As others say, it has reasonably good sound, and good stereo separation. Frequency  spectrum is decently linear, but only decently (see Other.)"," Floppy connector. Since its op-amps are not particularly powerful, it should get power through the buss. Digital to analog converters' word width not nearly enough for professional grade work. For that you'll need at least an M-Audio Delta 44 (36 bit wide word), at about $130. The DX7 is NOT in the pro league and it probably wasn't intended to be. No pro card will ever need EQ and they're flat from 20Hz to 22 Khz, and on up. If you need EQ, do it in your sequencer's individual tracks."," Now, I never had any trouble with reliability, yet again, this may be a matter of luck. I read complaints about cracks, pops, his and hum. I had those too, but the problem was not with the hardware, as I soon found out. It was with the software. Be careful when installing drivers. Most of these problems stem from faulty installation (including post-installation configuration.) I completely wiped out the drivers from my Win7 Pro system and reinstalled. None of the above symptoms repeated whatsoever. Sound is clean, good, but the dynamic is not as stellar as it could be, and, though there IS some hiss (little for most ears out there, but enough to be a disqualifier from pro work), there's no hum, on mine at least. As I said, it NEEDS equalization because when all faders are on zero the sound is flat as a table (little base, treble and middles are are colorless. You'll need plenty of EQ work.

No problems with power cable, and it did come with a free MOLEX adapter."," Installing the drivers was a pain, whenever I attempted to install the drivers (on multiple occasions) it would say 'please install Xonar DX!'  Yet it was securely installed and powered each time, and recognized by device manager.  So, I bought this card thinking I could output 24-bit 96khz 5.1 (or 7.1 for that matter) over a digital signal.  WRONG!  It is incapable of sending out any digital 5.1/7.1 signal at a greater quality than 16-bit/48 khz.  It can output a 16-bit 96khz signal, but only in 2-channel mode via PCM... which defeats the purpose of my surround setup.So after learning this, I decided to output via analog.  This too was a FAILURE!!  Sure, it would output analog signals just fine from native surround sources (like dvds, games, and 5.1 audio tracks), but it is absolutely impossible to upmix 2-channel sound to anything higher via analog.  Sure, they advertise the Dolby Pro-Logic feature... but that does NOT work with ANY setting.  Believe me, I tried every combination"," Finally, after about 3 weeks of owning it, the right front speaker became considerable more quiet than all the others... and I had ZERO enhancements on, no EQ, no volume adjustments per channel, etc.  After resetting the settings to factory, the right speaker was still MUCH more quiet for no apparent reason.  Yes, I did do a receiver check to see if it was the sound card or not, and it was in fact an issue originating from the xonar.  Also, my microphone sounded like there was a harley sitting on my desk when I keyed up in game!  But when I was on desktop, no issues.  I've never had this issue with the same game/settings on other cards.In summary:-HORRIBLE drivers... sure lots of settings, but many DO NOT WORK!-CANNOT output hifi sound over anything more than 2-ch-Buggy drivers & installation-Mic input sounds like you live in a cessna-Terrible tech support from AsusSwitching back to my trusty Auzentech X-Fi Prelude!!

Hardware audio mixing works reasonably well on it, but still not as well as the Creative Audigy2 it's backing up."," Available controls through ALSA for the card are extremely limited for the capabilities this card should have, but the real problem is that despite Asus' claims of a 116dB S/N ratio, background circuit noise on this card is offensively high.  There is a constant low-level background of electronic noise — buzzes, whistles, chattering, stuttering — even when all channels are completely muted, and completely independent of any volume control settings."," I haven't tried this card under Windows; it may work better there, though I suspect the background noise will be a constant.

I've already heard a few details in songs I haven't even noticed in headphones (and this is coming from a musician).  The Xonar software is very minimal and EAX emulation also works with no problems.  The card itself is low profile enough that it fit well above my huge Radeon HD 4870, although it just barely cleared a couple of capacitors on the motherboard.  Have had no problems with the power cable staying in, as well as any of the other things I saw mentioned in a few other reviews before I bought it.

The Xonar software seemed to have some oddities about it, but I'm more than satisfied with the default settings.  That's about it.

The sound quality is much clearer than the X-Fi which emphasized bass too much while the rest of the frequencies felt flat. The Xonar is very well balanced all around and I can typically hear everything out of music, movies and games. Unfortunately, I don't have any digital amplifier to test out the optical output.The Xonar drivers also have less processes running in the background and have never failed to load (which the Creative drivers did do occasionally on Windows 7 x64 Pro). Beware of the games though, the EAX emulation won't work for some. Games that use the latest Miles Sound System (Civilization IV/V, Empire Total War, Anno1404, etc.) will sound garbled if you select EAX or DirectSound in their settings. Despite a few problems, I don't think there's a better sounding card for its price range.",1,1

(not really a con)," I ran this card and a SB Audigy 2 ZS side by side through the same speaker setup in a blind test.  The sound quality, especially in music tracks was MUCH better that the Creative card.  It also sounded MUCH better/cleaner/crisp, whatever you want to call it, in games.

Everything sounds tinny with default settings, so you have to spend some time tweaking the equalizer to get it sounding decent.Connecting headphones to the front panel doesn't automatically switch the output to the headphones. Instead, you have to change it manually in the control panel. Be sure to select FP_Headphones, as there are two options for headphones and it's not immediately obvious that you have to specify the front panel headphones.As other reviewers have said, it fits poorly in your system. When you screw down the bracket, it wants to pull out of the PCI-E slot. Add in the weight of the additional power connection and it can unseat out of the slot easily."," I bought this card because it seemed to have good reviews and was highly recommended. After about 5-6 months of ownership, I have to say that I'm disappointed.As mentioned in the cons section, the card came unseated even though the bracket had been securely tightened down to my case.

The sound quality is much better than the onboard audio--sound is rich, fuller, better volume. However, sound still has its flaws. If you pump the volume up to the maximum, it gets distorted. Further, the ALSA driver in Linux is subpar--the channels have bizarre labels and it's hard to figure out what's what. Maybe that's because there is one jack on the card that doubles as both a digital and as an analog jack--better cards have more jacks on them so that digital and analog have dedicated jacks. Linux driver did not even have a master volume slider, so you have to fiddle with individual channels even if you just wanted to cut the master volume."," I RMA'd this and got the Soundblaster Audigy 4, which is well worth it. No sound distortion even on maximum volume. No funky channels, and dedicated analog/digital jacks. Much better Linux driver. Definitely worth the more $$.",5,6

This mixes multiple inputs to create a surround sound effect, and being off meant that when first connecting my speakers, some weren't even working and it sounded horrible. Also, the sampling rate was at 48kHz as opposed to 96kHz and the depth was at 16 Bits as opposed to 24 Bits!!!  It states that changing these to the higher settings means more CPU usage , but with today's CPUs it seems it would be at highest setting by default.  By the way this setting can found by clicking on the ""Go!"" button in MediaSource Go! and scrolling the bar to the right to find the Device Control button, click it and your there, AND IT""S DEFINITELY WORTH DOING!!!", You have to use the Creative Media Player to use the hiss removal and such...  Surely worth the money - didn't find the sampling and depth options until the 4th day and was still impressed up to then - with the new settings it's even better!,7,8

Creative Labs has been doing this for a long time, so I trust them, and the higher end sound cards in my opinion are more than MOST people need.  The human ear can only hear so good, and unless you need high end recording capabilites, HTPC outputs, or MIDI capabilities, this is all you will ever need."," I can't think of any possible con to this product other than some people may THINK they need a higher end sound card for PC gaming and general use and will slam this card because its cheap.

The minute I installed it (back in 2007, first time I built a computer) it did not play any sound at all through the back speakers, no matter how I configured it. Ok, I was excited about my new computer and this was really cheap compared to everything else, so I ignored it. I could live with it."," After a year, the software stopped working. Completely. No sound was playing through. I had to use the onboard device, because Creative drivers were/are horrible and did not fix the problem. Upgraded to vista later, tried installing the drivers/software again. Of course, it didn't work, and Creative once again had zero drivers at the time (unless I missed them on their impossible-to-navigate website). It finally installed, but I could not adjust the volume settings for the mic/aux/other options on main screen (I can't remember them), only for master level. You probably find it weird that I can't remember what settings are on the main volume screen (why doesn't he just look at it?). That's because I can't open the audio control panel at all anymore.

You must set it in speaker properties to 24bit manually, default is 16bit. As for those saying it is not Windows 7 compatible are absolutely wrong. They are doing something wrong. It is just a basic sound card but it blows my on board out of the water. I have a very good speaker setup though and definitely notice a huge difference in sound quality and volume. It produces better sounds then your average on board no matter what the others say. It is a cheap way to get quality audio for a decent sound system. Very good for games, music, and movie playback at a budget price.", Could use a direct output for amps and one more input., Be sure to uninstall your old sound drivers then disable onboard chip in bios before installing the card.

It definitely seems most instructions are geared to the analog connections and headphones, and not much info for the SPDIF connection set up. Playing around found that you have to set the default output as the Speakers and through sound blaster software select DOLBY or DTS, which they let you know- but also have to make sure the bit depth in the settings are set to 24 bit 96000 Hz for the receiver to playback the signal.

Being able to switch between headphones and speakers was nice," I bought this soundcard to drive a pair of Sennheiser HD600 headphones temporarily while I was building my new desktop amp. The card advertised having a 600 ohm headphone amplifier and while I guess it is technically true, as I was getting adequate volume out of the card, music and games just sounded so dull and lifeless out of the card. There was no punch, lows were muddy and I couldn't hear details I could hear through my previous audio source. Also, the microphone that came with the card was next to unusable. After boosting the microphone gain to almost 180%, I was hearable but it sounded like I was down a train tunnel. Don't get me wrong, this card works great, and if you are just looking for a gaming card then it will do fantastic in that role. However, if you have a decent pair of headphones and you are looking at this because it advertises having a built in headphone amp, do yourself a favor and look at the Xonar ST/STX by Asus.

You will need to take the time to configure it for your speakers.  If you have bottom of the barrel 5.1 speakers, like Logitech's over priced variances, you are not going to get the full picture and might as well use your on-board sound if you have that.  That is what most of those speaker systems are designed for.That being posted, this card has very clean and crisp 2.1 sound as well.  I am using the Klipsch THX certified 2.1.  Not the highest end speakers by any means.  BUT...  they are AMAZING with the right sound card.  I was truly blown away once I got it right.  you can turn these bad boys up real loud with almost NO destortion.  If I were a real reviewer I would give you the DB at which the sound starts to crumble.  But for Gaming??  Just perfect!I currently have use an Asus Rampage IV Formula with the built-in SupremeFX III and the SB-Z is noticeably better.  The main difference is the theatrical quality of games.  Just powerful, and clear...  I suggest using the Crystalvoice feature to make sure in-game dialog is coming through clearly.Also, online communications is awesome...  almost meed to adjust it because I wasn't used to the VoIP clarity over the game sounds.  I mostly use a Corsair Vengence 2000 headset for that but I kinda wish I have something that nice to plug into the SB-Z card...  It's just WAY better all around."," This card requires some serious tuning for each system.  So don't just plug-and-play this card thinking it should ""just work"".  It simply doesn't!!  Oh...  it will give you decent sound for sure, but you are better off using the on-board sound if that is why you spent $100+ on a high-end sound card.Especially you kids out there complaining about everything you buy that was expensive and doesn't work.

9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,6/9/2013 8:36:08 AM,Shane C.,Sound card review,2," Great card, loud, heavy bass, and a lot more."," The sad thing about this card is it doesn't deliver surround to a 5.1 or 7.1 speakers. I have logitech z 5500 speaker and when playing music all my speakers work but the center speaker is muted when logitech effect is set to 6 ch. Even when playing a movie, center is muted still and there is no dialogue when character is onscreen, but off screen there is a dialogue. There is a echo coming from it when the dialogue happens offscreen and as for gaming, center speaker are still muted and still no dialogue. I've talked to creative tech support and they think that something is wrong with my logitech z 5500 speakers and told me to disable my logitech z 5500 speaker when my logitech z 5500 control pod is a hardware that doesn't install with in windows such as driver/software like the sound card z does. A Control Pod is a control center hardware where you control the volume by turning the dial or press the button to change input or effects and such [look it up on google, google is always your best friend] it is obviously they do not have every speakers that everyone have or had. They only have creative speakers that why they found no problem with the sound card and would rather blame on us over speakers than the sound card they made, if they have the logitech z 5500 speaker like I do or Klipsch speakers that other had/have or any other speakers from 3rd party other than creative, I am sure they would've solved the problem and knew what was wrong with the card."," I decided and went back to the onboard sound [realtek] and have no problem, there is dialogue coming when it is onscreen even offscreen, there is no echo coming from it and it does play surround 5.1 and my center speakers work with it but unfortunately it doesn't give out bass and not even playing it louder like the sound card Z does, but better than nothing. =\ I am disappointed in creative, they should know better if they are gonna deliver a sound card that will blow our mind, then they should be able to solve the problem with the sound card and not sell us a broken one. And they should have the 3rd party speakers knowing what is wrong with the sound card they made.  So by my knowledge when they say ""Disable the logitech driver for z 5500"" it is obviously they do not have the same speakers that I have =[ SO DISAPPOINTED! That why I rate this card from 5 to 2 now [ignore my other review] The only reason why I left the other review to 5 is because I just installed and play the sound but I didn't play around to see if there is any hardware issues or sound problems.Would I recommend others to buy this card: My answer would be yes and no I will explain why below.Yes - because of how loud they deliver the sound, however if you set it to stereo [not 5.1 surround] and turn off the surround in the SBX tab, you're good to go! make sure you enable the full-range speakers front left and right and surround speakers and the bass management in the speakers/headphones tab.No - since this sound card doesn't give 5.1 surround or 7.1 to your 5.1 speakers and doesn't even give sounds to the center speakers and even the dialogue isn't even working when playing blu-ray movie in HQ [even youtube] and causing echo. Since I've read a lot feedback from other people that they have problem with this card, then IT IS NOT FOR YOU ALSO! Unless creative get this problem solved and give us a better driver that will make this card work as it is supposed to be then I will go for my YES answer instead of no and I will change it to 5 eggs instead of 2.",1,2
9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,6/4/2013 8:02:22 PM,Anonymous,Creative Getting it WRONG Again...FOLLOW-UP REVIEW,3," Further down, under the name Don I gave this sound card a glowing review.  Most of those pros still stand.  It is a decent sound card.  The Stereo Direct mode is excellent, the driver is easy to use/configure/understand, and the 3D positional audio works well once you have it dialed in right.  It will take some playing around.  BUT, some cons have reared up that made me buy another sound card."," The primary con is that with each driver iteration the number of issues increase, despite the assurance that they are fixing ""driver stability and responsiveness.""  Well, my experience tells me that the reverse is happening.  At first, with the driver I originally used in my original review, I had no real issues that I noticed where others did have issues.  I, being someone who does update drivers to head off any potential problems, started having the following issues upon keeping up with the updates on Creative's website:First issue to appear was:1.  Start-up sound in Windows 7 x64 is absent or cut in half.  Since I boot from from a Samsung SSD, it is not that my system boots slowly....This issue has become worse with each driver revision.  What is odd is it does not occur 100% of the time.  There are times when I do hear the start-up sound, perhaps 2 times out of 10.  Three times out of ten there is no sound at all.  Five times out of ten I hear the last second or two of the start-up sound.2.  My first sound card related driver crash in years happened just a few weeks ago, on the latest driver.  I thought I would not see one of those again, but here it is was.  A BSOD...hard lock.  I could not remember the last time I saw one before that!3.  Driver interface is still slow, and has not improved despite Creative's assurances they had improved responsiveness.  I have a very fast system.4.  No anti-pop technology is implemented in this card.  When booting/rebooting my Klipsch Promedia system is subjected to a loud and significant jolt/pop sound that if left unchecked would ruin them over time.All of the above cons have caused me to post a follow-up review and to rate the card at 3 eggs as opposed to my original 5.  This will average out to the 4 eggs it deserves at this point. Also, all of the issues I have seen are very thoroughly documented on the Creative Sound Blaster forums.  No one from Creative has intervened or attempted to answer any of the user issues there.  I did not even start looking at the forums until just recently, and to my surprise I see their forums buzzing with the same items I am pointing out here. Also, I performed a complete OS reinstall between driver updates, and used the new driver(s) on fresh installs each time.  I will usually wait until a few drivers have queued up and then perform a reinstall as opposed to removal of the old one/load new one.  This makes sure that I am not subject to drivers that leave junk behind."," Will Creative ever truly get their driver's right?  With successive sound card releases, years and years of trying, and listening (or not listening) to user feedback I am doubting that Creative will ever figure their own stuff out.  I hate to say it!  I was hoping that Creative had put all of the negative stuff behind them and were turning over a new leaf and becoming relevant again.  I guess not.

The sound is clear, the bass is heavy I can't feel my own heartbeat because of the bass. It help my logitech z5500 to play music and game and movie louder. A MUST BUY!"," The only issues is I can't figure out how to get the center and rear speaker to work in 5.1 with this card while it is in 6 ch mode [shown on my logitech z5500 control center] All I have to do is change it to movie mode or music mode in order for all the speaker to work. Then again in the creative control center if switched from 5.1 to stereo, all speakers will work in 6 Ch mode but it doesn't sound right at all =\. Hopefully I receive a little feedback and help from creative or from those who solve their problem with the 5.1 channel using the same sound card and logitech z5500 speakers."," Turn off the surround in the SBX pro studio tab , it makes the sound ugly and kinda a little low. Make sure you enable the Full-range speakers [front left and right is checked and surround speakers is checked to make it louder]. That is all I can think for now.",None,None

9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,5/25/2013 1:34:13 AM,Alex C.,SBZ review,4," Well I've had this card in my rig for about 2 months now and I have to say that it had performed almost flawlessly at all levels for game audio playback and some light music listening. It took the sound that my onboard chip (whatever the Z68 fatal1ty pro gen3 has) with all its electronic noise and dead empty sound, and turned it into a D*** fine sound with both my headset ( its a 2.1 but this thing makes it sound like a freaking 7.1) and my 5.1 speakers. Bass is much nicer than onboard and is not as uncontrolled as some say, just tweak the cut in a little to get it where it sounds right. Lights on the card are nice in my case because they light up my PSU (evga supernova 1500) and give it a menacing hue. Crystal voice works VERY well, I can put my headset mike INSIDE my case by the loud as heck fans WHILE blaring music through the external speakers loud enough to shake the desk and my friends STILL cant hear anything but my voice. The voice mod thing is ENTERTAINING in many ways over voice chats to people who dont know you. The provided FPA jack works very well with the 600qhom amp that even amps headphones that are pluged into the front panel not just the back. I cant say anything about the digital parts of the card as I will most likely never even use them. It fits very nicely in any x1 slot and the gold connecters are a nice touch (though in reality they do NOTHING for sound at all.....trust me I have a 100k+ reference grade audio system  and know how this all works) Overall for a computer based component it does a very good job of providing a pleasant listening experience for music and making the gunshots and bombs and spells and swords and nukes and footsteps and random bits of flying metal all sound RIGHT THERE and falling around you in games........as it should as it is a gaming focused product."," (sigh) Well I have to be honest and say there are a few things wrong with this card. First off is the thing doesn't seem to want to seat properly under my 2nd 680 so I had to put a lego in between them so the sound card wouldn't sit at a slight upward angle from it bracket. Second is THE THING FAILED AT LIFE. I was changing my background music while playing an RTS and then *poof* the driver cuts out and the device is listed, or not as missing from the whole computer....wth? I then found out the hard way what a TOTAL PAIN it is to reinstall this things drivers and almost ripped it out. The ONLY thing that stopped me was just how utterly HORRIBLE the onboard audio sounded for the 2 hours I spent getting the card up again compaired to the Z. Other than that freak occurance the card has acted totally normally providing it nice sound. Only other thing i can think of thats bad is that it makes ppl stare at your rig when its open at LANs and kind of makes me worry........but thats just me, right?"," Overall this card is AWSOME for use as a sound cleaner/enhancer moving from onboard chips and does quite well at listening to music. Voice comms are greatly improved by using this with a GOOD HEADSET, don't expect it to work wonders with any sub $50 one or with the useless ""beamforming mike"" they throw in with it. I must say the free mike is nice for use with a macbook (darn thing's hardware is so inferior that ANYTHING works better, gotta love that battery life though :) I would recommend this sound card to anyone looking to hear what their games were meant to sound like and don't want clan mates constantly b****ing about background noise.",1,1
9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,5/22/2013 9:56:43 AM,Michael M.,Z!!!,5," Powerful sound card that is very easy to install. Software and drivers work flawlessly on my win 7 X64 machine. My new mobo doesnt have PCI slots, so i couldnt use my old X-fi Fatality. I sold my old components to a friend and bought myself this card after being fed up with my onboard motherboard audio.  Great decision. This card is better and louder than my old X-fi Fatality. Explosions in BF3 are crisp and deep. Gunshots are how they should sound and no sound is missed. Great for CS:GO. I'mproves the audio experience no matter what you're doing on the computer. I bought it mainly for gaming but it works great for music too. I use HD 555 headphones and it brought new life into them compared to onboard sound. ability to switch between speakers and headphones is a great feature."," The red LEDs might prove annoying to some, but for my case and my build, it's a welcomed addition.

Whoever thought out the UI did a good job. It's easy to navigate and all the important information isn't hidden by additional menus., None through the past 5 months.," I've spent a great deal of time with sound cards in my life, ranging all the way back to the lovely MSDOS days. Man was it fun configuring your games to properly ultilize your sound card.  Since then I've become heavily invested in audio production, and in general high audio quality.When building a new system late last year I searched far and wide for an attractive sound card that offered high quality audio delivery while being affordable. I finally reached a consensus and stuck with trying out the ASUS Xonar Essence, which to note at the current time of writing is nearly $100 more than this card. After spending some time with it I came away completely frustrated in how poorly the UI was designed for the sound car control panel. Ranges of equalization in DB aren't displayed, frequency ranges are incorrectly labeled, bass mangement settings are pretty bare, etc etc. For a $190 card I expected more. That being said it did deliver in sound... until the Sound Blaster Z came out two weeks after my purchase.Having used Creative products in the past I knew well enough to stay away from them. Driver issues, aspects of sound management working and then suddenly they never do. It wasn't THAT bad, but I had a few hurdles I didn't enjoy jumping over again. I figured, though ""Hey why not, I'll return this and save some money, and if it sucks I'll just stick with the Asus card"". I'm glad I did.After spending the last 5 months with the Sound Blaster Z I can honestly say I think I've found a pretty solid choice in terms of options to price ratio. Mid ranges are warm, bass production is great, and the added features in Scout mode and crystal voice (while I don't use); are a nice added option. It's as if someone up at creative finally understands what they've been doing wrong and improved upon it.Some better highlights:SOUND:*Mid Range is warm and clean. If you're upgrading from onboard audio you'll probably hear some instruments playing in the background of your favorite songs you've never heard before.*Highs are crisp, but as always can be configured to be crisper through the crystalizer option.*Bass reproduction is handled nicely by being able to adjust the crossover frequency, but more importantly is the fact the sound control panel can separate the center channel and the subwoofer. Suprisingly a lot of sound cards out there tend to combine the center and sub.DRIVERS:*Easy to install.*Installer package is cleaned up, no longer comes with a lot of bloatware or unneeded programs.*The UI of the Sound Control Panel is nice and sleek, and offers much better functionality while retaining a modern feel. Most sound cards I've spent time with tend to have these techy/flashy design, like they came straight out of the 90's.FINAL THOUGHTS:With all that being said I didn't go into great detail. You can only fit so much information on these reviews and you can probably find some finer details in extensive reviews. Overall though",2,2
9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,5/14/2013 3:17:27 AM,Alexander W.,Great sound card if you can get the thing to work.,3," Sounds great with my 5.1 surround sound systemEnables complete surround sound where windows otherwise would not (e.g., music plays from all of my speakers instead of just the front left and right.)The red LED, although kind of bright, looks kind of cool in my Antec 900 case. Clashes with the blue but I still like it."," Where do I even begin with the cons of this thing?Trying to install the card is a nightmare, and had me pulling my hair out and screaming at my monitor. Here is the sequence of events that led me to getting this card to work.1. I installed the card in my case, easy enough except for the fact that the card just *barely* does NOT line up with the holes to screw the card in and align the ports. Very annoying, but it still works.2. I tried to boot my PC, but everytime I insert or remove this card from my system, the first boot afterwards freezes. Works again after forcing the power off and restarting.3. Installed the drivers from creatives website, they failed and hung my system.4. Installed the drivers from the disc which do not work, as they would not detect my speakers correctly.5. Removed the card from my PC.6. Deleted all the drivers and controllers for the card7. Reinserted card and rebooted8. Restarted Windows with only Microsoft services running.9. Installed the drivers from Creatives website again, this time successfully installing.So yeah, if you have 8 hours that you want to throw away installing a sound card, this is for you."," IF you can manage to get the card work, it sounds great. Bass is nice, sound is clear, etc. etc. The process of figuring out why my card wasn't installing and then figuring out what to do to get it to install was incredibly irritating and time consuming. Creative does NOT have a phone number you can call for support, so if you do have a problem you have to email them and wait for a response. I will think twice before I ever buy a sound card from Creative again.",2,5

It's a much fuller, richer sound with more clarity all around.Real time Dolby/DTS encoding is GREAT! I know some audiophiles don't like using the optical output on a sound card, but I love the ability to use optical out with true surround sound for devices that need it (e.g. my Razer Chimera 5.1 headset).The software has a lot of options to customize the sound to your liking, which is really nice. You can set up a sound profile that you like for gaming, one that you like for music, and one that you like for movies. I really like the Dialogue Plus and Crystalizer features here - they make games and movies sound great on my speakers.The included microphone is good enough to be worth using.For the features and quality of sound, the price is pretty good."," This thing is crazy buggy. You had better be prepared to troubleshoot your system when you buy this. Here's my experience after a week of use:Installed the sound card, booted up my PC to find MSI Afterburner and my graphics drivers completely messed up. Had to do a full clean and reinstall of both. Then, after 10 minutes of playing games, got loud and obnoxious static over all audio that required the PC to be rebooted or the sound card to be reset in Device Manager to fix. This also occurred during youtube videos or pretty much anything else.As I was debugging the static issue, I found that it would also sometimes get confused about what audio channels were which, and it would swap all the outputs around in bizarre ways over both analogue and optical out.Reinstalled the drivers, cleaned out all my on-board drivers and audio devices and disabled on-board audio in BIOS, reseated the card in the PCI-e slot... no luck. Turns out that the problem was that the card needed to be in a different PCI-e slot. I changed the slot and since then, sound has been working perfectly.-1 eggs for all that hassle and for not working in whatever PCI-e slot I want.HOWEVER, there has been a marked increase in BSODs on my system as a result of this card. I mine BTC with my rig, so my GPUs are running 100% of the time, and while it was stable before, it now has about 1-2 BSODs per day. Often, playing with settings in the software while the GPUs are busy will cause a BSOD, so I'm fairly certain it's the sound blaster software that is the issue.-1 more egg for decreasing system system stabilityAlso, the red LED is SUPER bright. Obnoxiously so. If you have a windowed case with any them other than gaudy red lighting, this card is going to look awful in your rig. It doesn't look so bad in my red-lit windowed Storm Trooper case, but for a lot of builds this would be -1 more egg. I think there's videos out there for how to disable it, but I bet that voids your warranty."," I hadn't used a dedicated sound card in about a decade before buying this, and this card reminded me why. The sound and the hardware is great, but the software and the implementation is stupidly buggy. I don't understand why having good sound in my PC means I have to have a less stable system that requires tons of troubleshooting to set up.I haven't decided yet if I'm going to keep this card or RMA it. Depends on how annoyed I get with BSODs while Bitcoin mining. I really do like the sound quality, and especially that I can finally get real surround output from my PC for my Chimera 5.1 headset, so I'll probably wind up keeping it.Creative's support is a bit slow at getting back to you, but they have been at least moderately helpful so far, which is good.I have this card hooked up via optical to a Razer Chimera 5.1 headset and via analogue to a set of Logitech Z906 speakers.My other hardware:i7-2600k16GB DDR3-2133ASRock z68 extreme7 gen3 (PCI-e 5 is the slot that worked...

9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,4/23/2013 7:40:55 PM,Adam K.,A Worthy Upgrade,4, The card with its EMI shield looked really cool.  Unfortunately once it's installed you can't see it anymore.Installation was a snap.  Everything went great the first time and I have yet to experience any problems.Tweaking the card with Creative's software is straightforward and easy.The separate headphone jack with its own amp is very convenient. Games sound amazing.  This card was obviously designed with gamers in mind over music listeners.Sound quality is worlds above my motherboard's Realtek ALC887 chip.," That being said, sound quality isn't an improvement over my X-Fi XtremeGamer Fatal1ty Pro I've been using for over 5 years.I've read others complain about it on here and I'm going to bring it up too: the red LED is totally unnecessary.  It clashes with my Antec 900's blue LED's and is too bright.Bass was too emphasized with this card IMHO."," Like I said, I've been using a X-Fi and the only reason I bought this Z is because I upgraded motherboards and the X-Fi just wouldn't play nice with it.  The audio quality and balance on the X-Fi was perfect for my tastes right out of the box, all I did was turn on Crystalizer.  This Z needed a little more tweaking.For starters, the speakers I'm using are Klipsch Promedia 2.1.  They'll make anything sound good, but with this sound card, the bass was way too heavy.  I feel like Creative assumed most people are using cheaper speakers that need augmentation from the sound card to sound decent.  I had to uncheck the bass enhancement box otherwise it sounded like my subwoofer was under water or something.  Now I can control the bass with my Pro Media's control unit and it sounds much more accurate and less messy.  I also unchecked the surround sound box because these speakers are so immersive already that it just sounded unnatural.The Crystalizer is great and I've enjoyed that feature since it was introduced.  Games sound just as good using these speakers as they did with my X-Fi, music isn't quite as clean though.Same goes when I use my headphones.  They are Ultrasone HFI 700's and again, can make anything sound amazing.  They have S-Logic which is Ultrasone's own surround sound replicator so having that feature turned on with the sound card makes it sound like you're in a coffee can.  Bass was way out of control, even with the box unchecked, there's too much bass.  It's almost distracting.  Luckily games couldn't sound better.  The detail and separation is outstanding and I can pinpoint sounds in the environment in FPS's like never before.So bottom line, if you already have an X-Fi, there's no reason to upgrade.  It's just as good with games and in my opinion the Z falls a little behind with music.  If you're using motherboard audio, this card will easily show you what you've been missing.",None,None

Like clockwork every 20-30 minutes after having my computer on the card would start crackling, popping, screeching and distorting the sound HEAVILY. I did research to find the newest drivers since Creative's automatic driver update tool doesn't work at all. Got the new drivers and the EXACT same thing happened.The sound was so horrible that I had to kill all the drivers and sound coming out of my computer to try to get it to stop and mind you it didn't. There was NO volume of any kind coming out of my computer but regardless the card decided to try to blow my headphones and eardrums out with ear deafening feed back reverb that managed to cycle through multiple bands of frequencies WHILE distorting even at low volumes. In short this card is so terrible I'm impressed.", Don't waste your money. I can't believe I spent $100 on this just to have to wait to get my RMA processed so I can buy a DIFFERENT card that does what it says it does.,4,7
9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,4/16/2013 8:14:39 PM,Michael W.,driver installation woes,4," The sound is very adjustable, loud, clear, and distinct.  I can hear bells tinkling and the bass is clear.    It installed easily and once I got the drivers working and the sound dialed in I am very happy with it.  This is a powerful card that will not need an amp unless you are using top of the line headphones.  I have the sound volume set at 40% and when watching things on Youtube I turn the volume down to 50% or so there."," While I was installing the drivers I dl'ed from the Creative site, Windoze was happily installing their drivers which conflicted with the drivers I was installing.  This caused all kinds of bad things until the sound card quit working."," The best way to install the drivers for this card is to first disconnect the computer from the internet so Windoze will not mess things up.  Then the installation went well for me.  A word of caution.  The default sound was set to 100% and when the sound kicked in it nearly blew the headphones off my head.  It hurt!    My case does not have a side window, so the red light is not an issue.",1,2

(Gaming and music/movies)Looks great and seems to be well made., Poor design; doesn't mount properly.," Don't get me wrong, it does exactly what it says on the tin, does it really well, and it looks great too. However its obvious they didn't put in nearly as much thought into the design of this card as they did about how ""pretty"" it is.I was having issues with this card suddenly vanishing from my device manager. After some searching online it seems the problem is the card, when properly mounted inside a case, it does not seat properly inside the socket and fails to register. If the card is installed without the mounting screw it tilts slightly at an upward angle away from the mounting bar but makes proper contact. If you push it level with the mounting bar the back of the card rises and looses contact with the PCIe socket. (This is true for all the PCIe sockets I have in my PC.)While the card preforms and looks great I can't justify more than 3 Eggs with such an obvious flaw to the card's design.",0,1
9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,4/10/2013 5:26:26 PM,Kenneth Z.,Great Card - Bad Drivers,3," The sound quality was mind blowing.  It looks great, and if the drivers are installed properly it sounds even better.", The drivers are typical creative; once you get a bad install you will need for do a format/reinstall or full image restore to fix it.  My boot time went from 65 seconds with an X-FI Xtreme Gamer to over three minutes.  With no sound card installed/enabled I can boot from off to ready to game in less than 30 seconds.," When first installed, it worked great until I tried to game.  Then the sound became choppy and the video frame rate dropped to a slide show.  I had used the wrong PCI-E Buss.  So I moved from my secondary x16 Buss (my video card in the primary slot) to my primary x4 slot (there was nothing in the secondary slot at that time).  Please note that according to the documentation it should have worked fine in the secondary x16 slot.  I got a huge nasty buzzing sound that almost knocked out any other sound the card attempted to make.  The RFI shield is on the wrong side of the card to stop the interference from the proximity of the video card, also the driver did not automatically reset itself to the new slot, it had to be manually set to the second Sound Blaster Z.  I uninstalled the driver, moved the video card, wiped everything creative from the computer and started over.  Dozens of installs and a long set of e-mails with support later the only time I get acceptable sound is when I am watching something off of the web that uses Flash (like YouTube).  Everything I play on my computer sounds tiny.  The sub-woofer simply does not cut in like it should.I am seriously thinking of formatting and reinstalling windows, but I really don’t want to do that nor should I have too.  I am considering asking for a refund...",1,3

This card is a major disappointment for me, but I wanted to get the cheapest good quality. Sorry to inform you, but this is not the one; it will go back to the store as soon as I can find appropriate replacement.I needed a card to upgrade from the one in my Inspiron 660, exclusively for movies or (rarely) music. Although gamers rate this card high, I cannot comment on that, because I do not game at all. The high ratings seem to come from people using amplified speakers and/or headphones. As my Harman Kardon 7550HD has a better sound processor, I am using the analog output (tried the optical, but it sounds worse) and let the HK do the sound conversion (Digital 7 on movies with all other things turned off as I am a purist). After trying all possible setting on this card, I can say it manipulates sound with everything turned off; enhances both bass and treble that is simply unacceptable in movies. The sound with all enhancements turned off should be linear, but this is far from that. In movies, the lower end of human speech (about half an octave, so it is impossible to correct with the software equalizer) is hardly audible. ""Crystallizer"" and ""Surround"" enabled and set at 25% gives body to the human voice, but the whole sound image gets mushy.However, if you are a gamer with cheap equipment, this is likely to work b/o the loudness it adds to the sound.",1,3

The difference is night/day.  If you already have a dedicated sound card you are probably good, unless you really one one of the ""features"" this card offers.I use headphones almost exclusively when on my PC.  If you are spending $100 or more on a set of headphones, then you'll want to make sure the source is sending a quality signal.  In that regard I am happy with the Sound Blaster Z.If there was Linux support at the time of this review it would have earned 5 eggs.Creative software/drivers have always been hit/miss.  As long as the sound stays this good, i'll be happy.Red LED:  I get the need for marketing, but an audio component doesn't really need a bright light, does it?  Though I do like the red finish on the card itself.  It seems like the smallest thing, but some people will want to put this in an HTPC and the light may be a distraction in a living room setting.",1,1

I sadly couldn't compare it to the XFi I had previously afew years ago as the P8V77-V Deluxe is PCI-e ONLY, but the Sound Blaster Z does sound better than I remember the XFi being.Only negatives are the bright red LED (which clashes with the blue that all my case fan lights in my Antec 900 are, and the blue and black mobo) and the Control Panel could be better.

There is a noticeable audio difference in both games and while listening to music.  The Creative Control panel is intuitive and lightweight. One of the benefits of using this sound card is that you can have speakers and headphones plugged in at the same time and you can switch between the two easily via the control panel. Took Creative long enough to implement this awesome feature :D," While all the connections in the back of the card are labeled with icons or numbers, I feel that it would be easier for poeple to differentiate between each connection if they had labeled each of the connections with text rather than icons or numbers.

9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,2/14/2013 10:01:09 AM,Anonymous,"FINALLY, Creative gets it right",5," I am going to write an in-depth review.  This new Creative card deserves it.  I have used Creative Sound Blaster cards in the past, starting with the original Sound Blaster 8 bit card, all the way to the X-Fi series.  I have experienced the driver foibles, hardware issues, and you name it.  I have also owned the ASUS Xonar DSX, Auzentech X-Fi Forte 7.1, and others.  Creative blows them ALL away.  First, the box.  The retail packaging is excellent, and shows off the card nicely through a transparent window.  The card comes tied down with twist ties to the red velvet coated cardboard inside tray.  Driver disks and a quick start guide are provided, although I downloaded the latest driver set from the Creative web site.  I know to never use a driver on a CD as shipped, especially for sound cards.  The big pros are that the card has a short, compact size with a PCI-E interface.  The connector is PCI-E x1.  EMI shielding (red metal), and the card has two red LEDs that are very bright and...well...more on that later.  Installation was painless...I simply uninstalled my VIA audio driver, went into my system BIOS and disabled on-board audio, and then shut down and put in the card.  Windows picked the card up immediately and I had sound.  I installed the latest driver set and was off and running.  The driver IS STABLE.  The driver does not appear to be buggy.  The driver is a little slow when bringing it up from the systray, but not a big deal.  The driver also provides a understandable interface that is easy to configure and most importantly has a one click switch between headphones and external speakers.  The settings for each are remembered between switching...which is a big deal.  I do not have to unplug my headphones, and I have them hooked directly into the dedicated headphone jack.  Speaking of the connectors on the card, we have a dedicated mic-in for the beam form microphone (included, but I don't use it), dedicated and amplified headphone out jack, and the typical array of other outputs including TOSLINK.  The card has a header for HD Audio, but I skipped this as I want maximum quality and passing the audio over a cable that runs through the case could introduce noise.  The driver provides a Stereo Direct mode that works extremely well with my Klipsh Promedia 2.1 set and provides 24 bit / 192 KHz direct stereo via the Cirrus Logic DAC with no molestation by sound effects, like SBX.  I have not heard such good sound before out of my speakers.  Switching over to headphones, I then utilize the SBX (formerly THX Tru Studio Pro) to provide virtualized surround and some extra punch with the Cystalizer and Bass Boost.  I turned up the surround portion, but reduced the Bass Boost and Crystalizer so the sound was not over processed.  Switching back and forth from standard SBX mode and Stereo Direct did not lead to crashing or any issues.  I have great positional sound in my games now, so the surround works well.  Get this card!  It is worth it!"," Only one...yup...just one:  those RED LEDs cannot be turned off.  Not that it is not pretty and it might fit into someone's lighting scheme that uses red, but what if you have a different lighting scheme or don't like red?"," Creative, my hat is off to you.  Seriously.  But, it took long enough to finally provide a sound card worth buying with your name on it.   This card caters to purists via Stereo Direct and those folks DO NOT like their sound streams processed or messed with.  This card also caters to the gamer who uses less expensive headphones and wants great positional audio in-game.  I could not have asked for more, since most other solutions do not provide both of these at once, or seriously fall down on sound quality in the process.  If you want basic bleeps and blaps and listen to just a few MP3s from time to time, then your on-board ALC898 or VIA VT2021 will be great (they are the best of the on-board solutions right now and I have used both) but if you care at all about your sound then this card is a must have, and it won't break the bank like the over-priced and over-rated HT Omega series, which have lately been cropping up with driver issues per the reviews.My Rig:Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD3H, F18 BIOSCrucial Ballistix Tactical DDR3-1866 9-9-9-27, 8 GB, 1.5VCore i7-2700K, default clocksZalman CNPS5X-Performa CPU H/S fanSamsung 830 SSD, 256GBEVGA FTW nVidia GTX 670 video cardWD Blue 1TB as mass storageSound Blaster Z sound cardASUS DVD/RWEnGenius B/G/N USB WiFi adapter, EUB9603HSeasonic X-Series 650W, Gold Certified modular PSULogitech G400iOne X-Armor Cherry MX Brown mechanical keyboardKlipsch Promedia 2.1 system and Razor ORCA cansWindows 7 64bit OEMViewsonic AH-IPS LED backlit 27"" display VX2770Smh",33,34

9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,1/24/2013 4:31:48 AM,Angela Y.,Superb Sound Quality,5," First off, I have used the X-FI Xtremegamer since 2006 and it has preformed amazingly even as it aged. Recently though it has started to act up so I decided to take a look at the new sound cards on the market by Creative since their last product I owned really rocked. So, after some looking around I chose the Sound Blaster Z and man I'm glad I did. This card blows my old X-FI Xtremegamer out of the the water in every aspect. The sound quality produced is amazing. The 116 snr gives a crystal clear audio experience in every medium I through at it. With my 5.1 Turtlebeach Z6A's hooked up to the sound blaster Z I can hear everything! I literally can hear the difference in audio in the games I play.(Planetside 2, BF3, Skyrim, Dirt 2). What also is cool is that Scout mode can be bound to a macro to be turned on and off when in game so you can hear enemy better. Honestly, it does work so you can her enemy better but messes up the other ranges of sound. I don't even need to use scout mode because I can already hear the enemy well enough with my 5.1 Turtlebeach Z6A's.  Overall the Sound Blaster Z has blown all my audio test out of the water. Great sound card for the money, couldn't be happier!", The only con I have is that I wish the SNR was 120 because everything else is awesome., If you have an old X-FI card this is a more than worthy upgrade!,3,4

Just stunning, this is my first sound card ever and I have to say I don't think I'll ever go back to onboard audio again. I cannot highly recommend this enough to everyone, if you wanna know how a game is supposed to be played it's with this, if you wanna know how content should be professionally made with high quality audio well this is the solution. Get it, you won't regret it."," Can't see why someone would put a bad thing about this, if anything comes up I'll update my review in the future."," Blown away by the performance boost, both in audio but in the fact that this frees my CPU from having to process the audio itself.",5,5

I tried everything I could think of, including disabling on-board audio (in bios) and all other audio devices (HDMI audio on my video cards), and re-installing. I have the card installed right next to one of my video cards (dual radeon 5850s), and Creative says not to do this, so perhaps this is the problem. Well, I can't install the card anywhere else on my mobo (Biostar A870U3, so this isn't helpful. When the Creative software did manage to recognize the card, I wasn't too impressed by the sound anyway, though it did seem to be working OK - the sound was alright, I just wasn't that impressed, even after fiddling with the various options in the control panel. And the full software installation is *very* bloated (but if you just install the driver and control panel it is fine). I noticed that another reviewer here thought the sound was better when driven by the standard Windows high def driver (Windows 7 in my case), so I tried this, and the sound is better IMO this way - it *does* impress me with this set-up. I have Logitech z5500s, which have their own set of effects, and it may be that the sound just gets over-processed with both the Creative effects and the z5500 effects. I was thinking of returning it, but given how it performs without the Creative software, I think I'll keep it. If you do use the Creative software, I recommend disabling all other audio devices before installation, and also downloading the driver from Creative's website rather than using the included CD. I'm dinging one star for the software issues.",2,4

I am a casual gamer, movie watcher, but when it comes to listening to music, I do not settle for sub par sound reproduction.  I tried several Asus cards initially, but something was always missing.  If the sound definition was good, then the imaging was poor or vice versa.  That said, I am quite impressed with this card and for what it is, I don't find it over priced at all.  Sound and imaging is awesome on this card, every instrument in songs have been very accurate to me, and just overall, a very clean sounding card."," You guessed it, the creative drivers.  It installed and worked, but it really degraded the sound quality.  I tried first with just the audio driver and it caused all sorts of issues with the quality.  It kept switching from stereo to 5.1 even when only the F L/R jack was used.  Installing the SBX studio suite solved it but it made everything somewhat muddy.  None of the SBX features really wowed me and took a lot of the clarity away.  Gamers and home theater buffs might enjoy them however."," For the best sound quality results for me was using this card with the stock Win 7 driver ""High Definition Audio"" one where it autodetects and installs on its own.  So if you find the SBX features just underwhelming and muddy, try it because it really made the quality a whole lot better.  But thats just me.  But the downside, you lose 5.1 functions.",1,1

Also, the control panel lacks the EAX effects options of my last sound blaster."," I was hoping that the ""shielding"" advertised with this SB product would have done a better job preventing static noise coming through speakers. Regardless, the fact that the noise is there, combined with the lack of EAX controls, and some issues trying to download updates with Creative's auto updater, I'm giving this product 3 eggs.

9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,12/9/2014 6:45:16 PM,Marcia P.,Wow big difference from onboard,5," Great Sound - I was constantly debating whether to pull the trigger on getting a sound card because my motherboard (Asus Maximus VI) already had pretty good onboard, but when plugging my headphones and speakers into this sound card is was i'd say 100% difference. I have a good headset (sennhiesers g4me ones) and my heaphones were being nerfed so hard by my onboard. With this soundcard I now see the full potential of this headset.Good Software - Lots of things to customize, the scout function isn't bad it pretty much dims the other sounds in the game so the footsteps stand out a lil bit more, not a huge difference thoPlug and play - really easy, just installed on board, installed software from creative website and it was workingIf you're debating and wondering if it is worth getting a sound card. I'd say just get the soundcard (this is my first sound card purchase ever). The sound coming out of my speakers and headset are much better.", The card was a bit loose inside the box it comes in from Creative. It was easy to rattle around so I was a bit concerned if maybe all that vibrating and constant movement would be bad for the card. So far no problems with the card at all.NOTE: It is better if you disable your onboard audio so that the windows sound properties knows the soundcard is now your default audio.,,1,1

In fact, my old X-Fi Fatality card was nothing less than STELLAR. However, it was PCI only and not compatible with my new machine. After a large amount of research I landed with the Sound Blaster Z. It had good reviews and I trust the judgment of others. Newegg’s shipping time was super fast, as usual, and I couldn’t wait to hear my new PC roar!!! The truth is, my computer started to whimper. The sound from this card made me scratch my head in disbelief, but that’s okay… it just needed a little tweaking, right? Wrong! After hours of maneuvering settings and reading set up reviews, I was left in awe. The card sounded extremely hollow and lacked polished/vibrant sound. For those thinking it’s his speakers? I tried this sound card with my Logitech z5500 5.1 speakers as well as my Logitech z623 2.1 speakers. Both are THX certified and able to BOOM with the best of them. I consider myself an avid gamer and overall audio enthusiast so needless to say I was very disappointed with this product. While playing Battlefield 4, I could hear loud surround sounds but my gun lacked the hard hitting ‘warlike’ feeling I have been used to with previous Creative cards. The Sound Blaster Z lacks in too many ways to count and doesn’t even have a dedicated bass/treble setting.I cannot recommend this for anyone looking for a dedicated sound card. I am VERY displeased with this product and will likely be looking elsewhere for future audio needs. Learn from my $100 mishap and consider another brand (Asus Xonar?).",0,1

So much better than the on-board audio on any motherboard especially on my Gigabyte UD4H.  The crossover frequency for the bass is really nice in the control panel to adjust how much bass I want for the different times of the day.  The included microphone is really nice for how cheap it feels.  I can have my music blasting, and a person on the other end doesn't hear a thing.  Also good so you don't hear the voices of people talking at you from another room haha.Works great for my Astro A40.  The dedicated headset port works really great also.  Sounds very clear, and not scratchy at all.  For some people, the red LED's on the card might be disruptive, annoying, or just plain ugly, but the card looks great and matches the rest of my build very nicely.The sound blaster control panel is very nice, and has a lot of adjustment features to get your sound to fit the environment you are in."," There are only a couple things that slightly bother me with this card.  1.  The card sometimes doesn't initialize with Windows 7.  Only has happened like 3 times since owning the card.  Nothing a quick reboot doesn't fix though.2.  The sound is VERY loud when using headphones in the headset port.  I need to have the volume at like 6, and even then it is loud.  3.  The back ports are hard to figure out which port is for which channel in 5.1 audio.  I always get it wrong, even when I think I have it right.  None of these points even together are worth taking an egg off for though."," If you are looking for a good all around sound card with excellent sound quality, look no further than this card.

Sound comes out of the speaker that it should come out, clear and crisp"," - Card can encode all sound (including games) to DTS or Dolby Digital Live using the optical out.  Hook an optical cable up to a home theater and you should get great sound.  Good thing is it sounds fantastic.  Bad thing is there is a very noticeable amount of latency.  Optical out is worthless for me.  Luckily I have the option of using the analog 5.1 on my system.  It worked like a charm.  If it hadn't been for this issue, I would have given this card 5 eggs and said it was the best value for the menu.  Instead, this holds the card back from being the best.  I checked the internet, I'm not the only one complaining about this issue so it isn't my system.- The red LED is ridiculously bright.  Users with a clear side window  on their case who put their system on the desk next to their monitor will be permanently blinded.- Scout Mode sounds artificial and is just a gimmick.  Waste of time implementing this in my opinion and should not be a major selling point for the card."," I would like to pat Creative on the back for a bit.  Creative's drivers have historically been horrible to bad when it came to installation and setup.  I have Windows 8.1.  The driver CD doesn't include win8.1 drivers.  So, I downloaded the drivers from Creative's website.  One download included all software and the drivers.  Installed the drivers and everything worked like a charm the first time.  No fuss.  The way it should be.  Additionally, the system app tray for the card doesn't have to be running all the time.  Make and set your changes.  Then you can close it.  The card always uses those changes.  Closing the app frees up memory and CPU time.  Nice.  Very nice Creative.  Keep it up.I have a Asus Xonar DSX.  I gave my system to a family member.  I bought this card for my new system.  I kept this one; the sound quality seems fuller and the drivers/app seem more stable.

The CM storm headphones take some serious power to get the most out of them, since they are analog, and this card is the perfect match.Here's where I went wrong: I bought an Asus maximus vi Gene, assuming the beefed up onboard sound would replace this card and I could run Crossfire on the small matx board instead of stepping up to a bigger board. Well, I assumed wrong. The Asus board doesn't even come close to what this sound card can do. So now I'm installing the card onto the Asus board and will have to step up to a more powerful single card and return my unopened 270x.Don't make the mistake I did by assuming that even top end onboard sound options are good enough.

No issues with drivers under windows 7.", None so far.," I found this card for $100, so I went for it. Upgraded from a Sound Blaster X-fi Extreme Gamer.

If my subwoofer is working one of the speakers isn't and vice versa. Uninstalling creative's software is the only thing that stops it, but without the driver backing up the special features you're defeating the point of having the card in the first place.I stayed away from creative products for 10 years because of bad drivers and now it appears it'll be another 10 before I think about buying more.",3,5

9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,1/2/2014 1:54:35 PM,Jacob M.,Very happy,5," This definitely makes a difference in the bass quality for sure! I love how it makes the clarity of every sound effect just totally enhanced, at least 40% better of what my on-board HD audio sounded like. I love the design and casing of the card, it's very attractive and flashy. It's definitely a must buy for every build I'll do that's going to be gaming related."," Only problem I can see is when windows starts up and it does the start up sound effect, it gets cut off about halfway through it, not that it's a big deal or anything. I just don't know why it tends to do that."," This card is perfect for gaming, the price, design, and quality. I'd say this is one of the best produced sound cards out there overall for the price and performance. I've followed this company and used their products for over a decade now and as of always, Creative hits a solid home run for me.",1,2
9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,1/2/2014 12:59:03 PM,Scott C.,Ignoring is Fun,5, Very good Sound Quality!I definitely hear the little differences in the music  that you never pick up off a MotherBoard. As for the program they provided; it is easy to understand and navigate through.," The Red Light. I kinda did not expect an Internal piece to have its' own LED. That's not really a big thing to complain about, but my entire system is Blue. (Not really a valid Con)"," I asked around before I bought this. Previously I only used the Motherboard, because EVERYONE told me it's basically the same. Well, I'm telling you I noticed an imediate difference in sound quality. I was also told to use a reciever instead of a Sound-Card. Multiple people have told me to do that, I ignored them and tried out a Soundcard myself. I've heard the 2 Side by Side now; Sound Card is superior in Quality. Granted it didn't get nearly as loud as the one hooked up the reciever, but I definitely get MUCH higher Quality sound from the card. THe Reciever sounds just like it does on the MotherBoard, just loud. And Admittantly I'm not sure if it's truly effecting my Games; but I've noticed a fairly large jump in my Perfomance on games; that I have a Lot of things going on (Skyrim with Loads of Immersion Mods).",1,2

Great bass & the midtones & highs come through with so clarity, every nuance in the music is there. It has so much more volume & detail. My head phones work & sound better in sound & volume also. The detail in the sound is awesome!!", None so far," I had ASUS DX sound card in my machine before, which are the same price as the Sound Blaster Z. I have a new build & I was going to get another ASUS card but decided to try a different brand just to try something else. I mean how are you going to really know if you don't try? Well I put the Z in the old build as I use it the most & I will put the ASUS in the new build & keep the Z where I have it.My system did not recognize the software so I did a manual install & it was no sweat. Think I'll just listen to it for today & tweak it later.One nit pick, wish it had a blue light instead of red as blue is the color of all my lights & mods. But I knew going into this that it had a red theme & red lights. Hey it's Christmas reds OK!H&ll yes I would recommend this to a friend & foe alike.",3,3
9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,12/17/2013 6:30:37 AM,Zachary L.,Great sound card,4," 6 channel sound (5.1), stereo mic+ stereo mic in, TOSLINK in/out, software suite", OBNOXIOUSLY BRIGHT RED LEDS," The beamforming mic it comes with is okay, I mainly bought this because I wanted to have both my Sennheiser 598s AND 5.1 surround to be plugged in, without having to mess with physical connections. The drivers are slow, but they do work once they are set up properly. The acoustic audio cancellation (stopping speakers from feeding into mic) is amazing on this card. I also noticed one of the speaker settings ""stereo direct"" when selected crashes windows audio, and requires you to manually restart the service.    Scout mode is honestly unnecessary.I have to say this card is great, and the Zx version of it, I have read that the ACM (volume wheel + I/O) adds noise. Also, my card (not the Zx) has had zero noise, even though it is right next to a 760 and 310. It is kinda scary though, the back of my 760 is about 3/4cm away from the ALL METAL SHROUD OVER THE SOUND CARD and might short something.    Also, you can unscrew the red cover and cover the LEDs with duct tape to make them less bright, that's what I did. I'm not risking bridging past the LEDs or removing them.",1,1

He is satisfied and uses it with Bose speakers and Beats headphones (yeah, yeah)...", Sometimes audio driver gets messed up and computer has to be restarted. But I think the new updates fixed that., There's a cheaper OEM version but this one has included mic which is cool but probably useless.,1,2

This soundcard was on sale and after careful research and comparisons I bit the bullet and decided to give it a try. WOW WAS I GLAD I DID!!!! The Soundblaster Z has blown my mind and changed the way I play my games, everything sounds so much more, and has enhanced the immersion level of everything I play as well as movies. I would hands down recommend this product to anyone looking for that extra edge as well as immersion in gaming. It has great sounds, options, as well as voice morphing to fool your friends lol. The bass levels (with a good pair of headphones or speakers) was awesome. I now have true 5.1 and with its additonal scout mode, it literally DOES help you in first person shooters, to almost be considered cheating lol.

9SIA4RE4VN5417,29-102-048,11/24/2013 5:38:49 PM,Philip O.,Great Card,5," As someone who was burned with terrible drivers and constant audio-related BSODs with an X-Fi card years ago, I took a chance on the Sound Blaster Z, as I have a decent 5.1 surround sound system and felt that the onboard Realtek solution was subpar.I've been happily surprised by how solid the drivers have been and how the card has performed in different rigs (a i7-920 and an i7-4770). No crashes whatsoever and I get great sounding audio out of my THX-certified speakers.The drivers/control panel eat up a paltry 4MB of RAM when minimized to the taskbar. They do eat up about 50MB of RAM if you open it up, but that's nothing on my 16GB system. RAM is cheap and plentiful."," Would be nice to disable the red light.

Audigy - XFi PCI - XFI PCIe - Core3D and now Z/Zx/ZXr all cards provide the same terrible drivers. Zero efforts by Creative to provide fully Windows compatible drivers. Problems people were facing since Audigy/Vista, the same ones face even today. For instance, settings not being saved after reboot, cards not being recognized in Device manager and other problems. This indincates only one thing. Creative doesn't allocate capable developers to fix the drivers. Simply unacceptable and you will waste your money. They aren't even capable to natively bypass UAC. As it seems their drivers need re-write from scratch, something that will never happen."," So many more I could day, but... forget it. Do as you wish. Keep buying gives Creative the incensive to keep doing the same over and over.",3,7

Games and movies sound very good with minimal adjustments in the Sound Blaster control panel software provided."," It's loud because you can't adjust the headphone amp, making the minimum volume very difficult to adjust.  Anything over 10% volume blows your eardrums out so you can really only adjust the volume between 6 and 10% in Windows volume control.  Drivers are mediocre at best, especially under Windows 8.1.  Sound Blaster Control Panel software is frequently unresponsive after upgrading to Windows 8.1, even after wiping the drivers and reinstalling."," I bought this for 80 dollars and I don't feel ripped off, but if I could go back, I'd try a different product from someone that isn't Creative Labs.  Their refusal to release quality drivers, updated regularly, was the reason I stopped buying their products long ago and I'm not sure why I gave them a second chance.",5,6
