It is a fast drive when being copied to. Writing to another drive, the speed will vary based upon the characteristics of the other drive. Physically,  the drive warms up a little bit but I have other Fantom drives that heat up to a greater extent. This is not a problem to date. New Egg now advertises another 5TB Fantom HD (GD5000U3 Silver) for $210.00 with free shipping. The drive I purchased sells for about $204.00 plus about $8-9 shipping.

If you use battery power (UPS), you will experience eSata disconnecting issues and not being able to format them.

Hope this helps someone else.Edited Dec 1st:  Multiple days of fast backups with no issues.  Suddenly last night one of the drives starts acting up again disappearing during write operations.

(maybe can be addressed through firmware update?)No eSATAHad major issues with Windows 8.0 x64 would BSOD on USB3.0 portonce upgraded to windows 8.1 USB3.0 port worked fine on my ASUS crosshair V Formula-z With this My Book Duo"," First impressions was how nice the look of the device was its pretty well designed, the passive air flow is good just by looking at it, as you can see through top to bottom, while testing the device would give off heat and you can feel it flow through it, without even the fan engaging.   I dislike the wall adaptors I would prefer a wired adaptor like laptops and other devices have, that gives you the freedom in tight spaces.  The utility is nice and slick but is designed for the avg home user, and the lack for advanced options showing more raw data about the controller and the physical drives is a minus in my book.  (unless I missed some tab or setting).  This unit compared to my Vantec NexStar HX4R is nice as far as design for the air flow, but of course we are talking about 2x vs 4x enclosure that give way more raid options and a dedicated 80mm fan with manual speed control.  Price wise the Vantec has the My Book Duo beat considering what you get with the NexStar, if you do the math of the cost of the 2TB red drives.  This is why I believe WD should have had a much lower price since they are using their own drives and can save more with preinstalled units in this enclosure.   The WD My Book Duo should not come with Raid 0 preinstalled, I will bet the average user will think that Raid 0 might give them redundancy which it does not, in fact gives 2x the risk.  Personally I will be running this unit with Raid 1, the performance is still good in my book, and the size of the unit makes it very convenient for moving around along with weight (2x drives vs 4x).  My Vantec HX4R configured in Raid 10 with 4x old but trusty Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 ST3320620AS 320GB 7200 16MB cache drives, did decent in comparison, to WD My Book Duo in Raid 1, of course Raid 0, lost in the speed.

N82E16822236728,22-236-728,8/11/2014 10:10:14 PM,Anonymous,Nice but could be better,3," Nice sized unit, not too large or small and it's very heavy so it's not going to get knocked over very easily.The drive includes software and utilities for windows and Mac thus no need for a CD which is not included or you can download the latest from WDC's main site.The front LED is white which is nice for a change instead of the super bright blue that are usually used.Each drive has it's own LED which will be black unless there is an issue in which case they will turn red alerting you to a problem that needs corrected.Installation was as easy as plugging in the USB cord, power and allowing windows to install some drivers and it's up and running.The unit is packed very well in the box which is always good to see. It's not DOA, always another plus.The drives in this unit are of course WD RED drives which are decent, not the fastest but decent.Two included USB3.0 ports on the back to daisy chain another My book or another external enclosure.The Price is fairly decent if you take into account a RED 2TB drive is roughly $100 each thus the unit with raid controller is only $79 currently.I doubt you will find any external hardware raid unit for that price point from anybody currently.Made in Thailand, not China!"," WD is a bit misleading on their stats. The unit comes pre-configured for raid0 which is why you have 4TB but you do not have two 4TB drives.The idea behind backup is redundancy, you do not get that with raid0.This unit has a built in 50mm? fan but it does not turn on until the RED drives hit 60C! thus the fan will never turn on making it pointless.[WD confirmed this for me]WD states the RED drives can ""safely"" reach up to 60c max which is extremely hot and will really kill the lifespan plus induce errors and bad sectors as the media breaks down.Not sure I'd trust my critical media to that environment.That said doing benchmarks and transferring some files I easily had it up to 48C [120F] which I find a bit warm. I could feel the heat rising from the top of the unit and the unit had a slight burning plastic smell.My Lian-Li case has a top fan and once I put the WD My book Duo on top so it gets some decent airflow through the bottom grills [and out the top] the drive temps dropped to 84F which is so much better for long life. I never planned to have this on top of my case as it is rather heavy to leave on top of a aluminum case long term.Another issue is the fact there is no ON/OFF switch. You can setup with WD software to have the unit sleep but if you want to physically turn it off and put it aside then your only option once you eject it is to pull the power plug.The unit has a 2 year warranty which I found odd as the RED drives have a 3 year warranty.

I have subsequently seen many reviews stating you must use the WD MyBook AV version w/ eSATA connectivity for this purpose. I have not verified this info by attempting connection & use via the DVR USB port & MyBook USB Cable."," Bottom Line: MyBook meets my requirement as a back-up device, and I would recommend it for that purpose. Although the item may work better with higher end software / back-up program. I will need to check this out further.",5,6

So far, it has been cool running at around 85F-100F depending on idle versus actual use.8TB drives are not exactly in the $/GB sweet spot, but when capacity is important, this drive will certainly perform its task.

A few years ago, I couldn’t have dreamed of having 10 terabytes sitting on my desk next to me.  I am a freelance/professional photographer in my spare time and anyone who has done independent work for someone knows just how absolutely scary it can be to lose someone’s files.  Having backups of your backups of your backups is the best way to ensure you’ll never run into that problem, and this is a great way to do so!  The unit is pretty attractive, features a quick on/off button, and some nice little activity lights for each drive (that I currently have covered with black electrical tape!  Blegh.)In my 10+ years of purchasing computers and hardware from Newegg, I can say without a doubt that Western Digital is the only name I trust.  Not that others aren’t reliable, but nothing is better than a Western Digital drive for reliability and performance.  Granted, I’ve only had this setup for a few weeks now, but as with anything else by WD, I look forward to years of trouble free use.  The drives themselves are 5 TB WD Black drives, each at 128 MB of cache.  Again, you just can’t buy a drive with a better combination of raw speed and reliability.  The USB ports on the front allow you to plug in other devices, including another drive like this or a cell phone to charge.  It has some daisy-chaining functionality; I have my wireless keyboard receiver plugged in and it is working.  I’m not entirely sure how far that capability stretches, though. Having the option of RAID configurations and JBOD is nice, though I suspect RAID 0/1 are going to be the most used.  Mine are currently set up to stripe, not mirror, for all out speed.  Though using USB 3.0 is going to limit your speed a bit compared to thunderbolt, I’m still seeing 300+ MB/s and I’m quite happy with that."," Why does “Professional” now have to mean Mac?  I have been doing professional photography for 6 or 7 years on a Windows system with no problems.  All but two of the most high end photographers I know use Windows for their systems because duh, they don’t have $3k to shell out on a laptop.  I am not sure if this is directed at WD or not, but I think you get the idea.  I wasn’t thrilled to have to re-format just to be able to even use the drive on my Windows 7/8/10 system.  Yes, it is pretty painless for just about anyone.  Some of the reviews I’ve read on Newegg and elsewhere talk about how quiet the unit is because the cooling fan built in rarely, if ever has to kick on.  This is true, I am yet to hear the cooling fan kick on, but that’s probably more a product of the environment it is in (cold computer room around 55º) rather than the device itself.  Standard disk drives still make plenty of spinning, seeking, reading, writing noises and these are no different.  I guess I wouldn’t call them loud per se, since they’re probably identical to every other HDD I own, but when they aren’t tucked away in a computer case, you’re a little more aware every time they spin up.  Just be aware and don’t expect them to be super whisper quiet. "," My system is admittedly a little bit on the older side (18 year old me NEVER thought I’d say that!)  Running an AMD 1090T, 850W PSU, Radeon 6950 card, and 890G chipset motherboard.  Good for 2011, and gets the job done in 2015.  However, my machine does have USB 3.0 onboard, so pairing and getting everything set up was pretty easy, once I went in and set up the drive for Windows.   The ability to hot-swap the drives very easily is nice, though I don’t see a whole lot of people having the need to hot swap 5 TB drives.   I suppose if you have to (or if you have it set up for JBOD) the feature would be much more useful. The bottom line: yes, its very expensive.  But you get what you pay for!",1,1
9SIA1UH4N09613,22-236-977,12/4/2015 9:23:26 AM,David K.,Outstanding Quality and Performance,5," This Western Digital My Book Pro external RAID enclosure features two 5 TB WD Black series hard drives. Each drive is rated for 7200 RPM and has 128 MB of cache. In my experience there is no better hard drive than Western Digital Black series. There are drives that are a bit faster, but their cost far outweighs the benefits and they're usually limited in capacity as well. With the Black series drives you get near SSD level performance, but far more capacity at a much more reasonable cost. I have also had experience with WD Purple, Red and Blue series drives as well. Each series is targeted for a specific type of task. For example, the Blue series is their economy line. If maximum capacity is your sole concern, and maximum bandwidth isn't a factor, the Blue series drives are a great choice. If you want capacity and the highest possible speed for gaming or for high resolution recording, then the Black series is the way to go. That's what you're getting with this external RAID enclosure. The highest capacity consumer level hard drives available and solid state drive level performance in a convenient, mobile platform. This My Book Pro features 3 USB 3.0 ports, 2 on the front and one in the back. It also has a two Thunderbolt ports on the back as well. This device is nearly as convenient as any standard external hard drive. A bit bigger, of course, but it works the same way. But with an extraordinary advantage in capacity and bandwidth.Cooling has certainly been taken into consideration when this RAID enclosure was designed. It has an external power supply, so heat from the power brick won't be a problem. It is also fan cooled. It has an 80mm exhaust fan to remove any heat the dual drives create. This enclosure also has a power button. Which may not seem important, but it is nice to be able to turn it off when it's not needed. If you're using one of these, then you must have important data that you don't want lost and being able to maximize the life of your drives by simply turning it off when it's not needed is an excellent feature. But, a RAID array isn't as simple as a standard hard drive. It is recommended that you either shut down your computer or properly eject the drive manually in your OS to avoid data corruption. With the included software you have the option to choose between RAID 1 or 0. Personally, I would only ever choose to use RAID 0. But RAID 1 does have advantages. RAID 1 or 0 requires identical had drives, which this already comes equipped with. RAID 1 only gives you access to half as much space. Whatever the capacity of a single drive of your RAID configuration is what you will have access to. But that has the advantage of being the faster option and your data is far more secure should one of the drives fail. With RAID 0 you will have all the capacity of both drives and excellent performance, but should one of the drives fail, all your data will be lost."," My system specs: Core i7 4790K 4.8 GHz Z97 OC Formula 16 GB DDR3 Trident X 2666 MHz SLI GTX 980 Classified RAID 0 SSDs, RAID 0 HDDs, BD-R 1000w PSU Dual Custom liquid Cooling Loops Win10 x64 I hooked up the My Book Pro to my PC via USB 3.0. Windows correctly recognized It and installed the appropriate drivers. But when I went to my ""My PC"" it wasn't listed. I opened Device Manager and it saw the My Book Pro. But for some reason I couldn't access the contents of the drive from anywhere. So to gain access, what I had to do was.. In Device Manager, right click on the My Book Pro drive and select uninstall. Next, unhook the My Book Pro by unplugging the USB cable and restart the computer. Then once Windows has rebooted, reconnect the drives USB cable. Once Windows has recognized the device, right click on the Start Button and select Disk Management. When in disc management, right click on the primary partition section of the My Book Pro graph on the lower section of the window, and select Delete. Once it has deleted the primary partition, right click again and select Format. When it asks, select NTFS as the file system and change the drive letter if you like. I left everything at default. Once the drive has been formatted you should be able to access it as if it were any other drive. All the factory installed software will be gone, but you can download all of it from Western Digitals support website. As I've never had that happen before and I've only been running Windows 10 for a couple weeks, I had to call Western Digitals phone support. A live chat support would have been more convenient, at least that is what I would have preferred. I'm not a fan for chatting over the phone. When I called their support, a woman with an Indian accent answered the phone. She was very polite, professional, spoke clearly and was skilled in support for Western Digital hardware. I asked a few off the wall questions about their software and she was able to answer without having look it up. Not a con really, but attached to the previous subject.I tried to connect the My Book Pro to my router to see if I could use it for network access, but my router didn't recognize it.  My router is a one of the newer high end models, so that is a feature that probably won't be supported.I don't consider any of these things to be at the fault of this device or Western Digital.  So I am not deducting any Eggs for this."," I tested this device in RAID 0 using Crystal Disk Mark, AS SSD and AIDA 64 benchmarks. I benchmarked file sizes between 256KB to 25GB. I also monitored transfer speeds from this RAID enclosure to my RAID SSDs with file sizes up to 50 GB. Sequential read and write speeds were fairly consistent across all my benchmarks, maxing out at around 390 MB/sec and dropping no lower than 340 MB/sec for both read and write. A RAID 1 configuration would probably get much closer to the rated maximum speed Western Digital advertises. Swapping drives is a piece of cake. Just pop open the plastic cover for each of your hard drives. The drive on that side will eject as you open the plastic cover. Just grab ahold of the drive and pull it out. Reinstalling the drive is just as easy, just make sure your drive is oriented correctly and push it into place until it's seated back all the way. It will get to a point where you can feel the SATA power and data ports locking into position and the mech won't go back any further. To complete installation, you just close the plastic cover to lock the drive into proper position. If you've already got one of these, and you find that 8-12 TB capacity isn't enough, you can Daisy chain up to 6 of these devices together. Giving you a virtually inexhaustible source of data storage. This feature would be particularly useful in a corporate setting. Giving your entire network access to a large data pool without the need for servers or a cloud, but with enough bandwidth to accommodate simultaneous access for multiple users. And the security of being able to disconnect it with a single yank of the cord or the push of a button. This external RAID enclosure is an absolutely excellent source for high resolution recordings. I have been struggling with a way to record my 4K game play at 60 fps with 7.1 surround sound without dropping frames, stuttering, lag or just plain freezing. I have determined that using my primary data drive to run my OS and games while recording isn't a viable option for beyond 1080p. I was an early adopter of 4K technology and was eager to show off the quality of 4K game play on social media. However, at the time I had only a single 10K RPM Raptor hard drive. Which was only good enough to use as a primary OS drive while recording about 3 fps at 4K. So I upgraded to RAID 0 SSDs. Which was sufficient enough bandwidth to record my game play at 4K, 60 fps and beyond. But due to the minuscule drive size, the SSDs tended to fill up within a matter of a couple hours. However, with the speed of 2 Western Digital Black hard drives in RAID 0 and 9315 GB of free space I can record every session, no matter how long, and not run out of storage.The build quality is excellent, it's very sturdy.  Certain to hold up to a lot of abuse.The My Book Pro is a serious performance external storage solution.  If you have need for a mountain of storage, excellent speed and don't mind the cost, this is a great choice.  I love it.",None,None

I'd say this is ideal for people who work on projects with large images or videos and want to use this disk as a sort of scratch disk for their rendering, etc. Or in RAID 1 it could make it a very attractive option as a backup drive. On the whole, the product is well made. I really wish, however, it had the capability of being on the network, but it's not the end of the world.

You can either have it use the drives as one large partition (10TB) or you can use a RAID configuration so you do not lose your data (5TB when in RAID 1).When combined with a Wireless Router that supports a USB 3.0 Media Center it proves to be a very reliable network drive. Since it has RAID I copied all of my music, home videos and pictures to the drive. Since I use ROKU’s (and do streaming for TV) around the home I was able to access the My Book Pro from any room and any TV in the home.The My Book Pro is the perfect solution for a network drive, media center with the right equipment. Its biggest feature is if the drive goes bad the data is all mirrored and you just need to replace it. No more worries about a virus taking over your computer or the hard drive crashing because all of the important data is farmed off to this separate drive on the Media Center network.If you like listening to music on your PC (or laptop) you can use Media Monkey to connect into the Media Center and access all the music off the My Book Pro.The drives are hot-swappable and if you ever need larger storage you can just buy new drives and take these out.", - This particular unit is very expensive," - Although the price for this 10TB unit is expensive there are lower options within the same family line of hardware.

According to the specifications, the My Book Duo measures 6"" x 6"" x 4"" and weighs in at a little over 5lbs, so this isn't something you'll be using on-the-go.  It ships with two (2) 6TB WD Red drives designed specifically for NAS use.  The WD Red drives have become some of the most reliable HDDs on the market recently, so it's nice to see WD using their flagship consumer grade HDD in this device.The plastic lid pops off without the need for tools and provides access to the HDDs.  Each drive can be removed from the back plane by pulling on a plastic tab (more on this tab later) and the drive slides out.  This makes for a pretty quick drive change, except for having to transfer the posts from the old drive to the new drive.Turn the device around and you'll find the Micro USB 3.0 PC interface, a power connection and a USB 3.0 hub containing 2 x USB 3.0 ports.Out of the box, the device is configured for RAID 0 providing for a ton of storage buy no redundancy.  I almost wish that WD would have shipped this RAID 1, as some people might not understand the different levels of RAID.  I wouldn't want to see someone transfer all their files to the drive and later find out there was no drive failure protection.  The RAID level can be changed by using the provided WD software.  Keep in mind that RAID 1 is not a viable backup.  Partition tables can get hosed, power surges can destroy drives, you could knock it off the desk, etc.  RAID 1 is only designed to protect against a mechanical HDD failure, it is not intended to be a sole solution for backup of data.  Speaking of software, WD provides their Utilities, Acronis True Image, WD Security and SmartWare.  The Security software allows you to use the 256 bit AES encryption the device supports if you want to protect your data.  Using a combination of the True Image and SmartWare, you can not only back up your data, but also image your machine.  I would have liked to see both applications combined into one tool as opposed to having to use two separate programs for a complete backup.With that said, the included software is easy to use and very straight forward. Running some hardware transfer tests, I was seeing the following transfer rates:RAID 1 - Write ~146MB/sRAID 1 - Read ~161MB/sRAID 0 - Write ~221MB/sRAID 0 - Read - 252MB/sLets just say this is the fastest external HDD I've ever tested."," I was a little disappointed by the way the drives are removed.  There is a cheap plastic tab that's attached to the post on the side of the drive and looks as though it could be easily ripped off the side of the drive.  I would have preferred a latch system or some other way of removal.  Other high end devices I've used allow drives to be swapped without the need for tools.  I would have liked WD to include that as well.  With their system, you still need a screwdriver to transfer the drive posts that align the drive when it's installed.WD indicates that no tools are required to replace drives, but I'm still trying to figure out how that's possible since you definitely need a screw driver to transfer the posts on the sides of the drive.  You can take a look at the NewEgg picture showing the top of the device open to see what I mean about the alignment posts.Why the heck isn't there a LAN port on this thing?  It just boggles my mind that you wouldn't include the ability to network this bad boy.   I just can't think of anyone that would really need 12TB of local storage.The warranty is a little too short for my liking.  I would liked to have seen WD include a 5 year warranty on the My Book Duo.My cons might seem petty, but I try to be overly thorough when I write my reviews.  For these two reasons, I'm deducting 1 egg.  If I had the ability, I would only deduct 1/2 egg, but NewEgg doesn't allow for 1/2 egg deductions."," The 12TB WD My Book Duo is fast, easy to install and comes with a great software suite.

9SIA1UH4N09757,22-236-731,8/19/2014 5:37:59 PM,Thomas B.,Terabytes of Additional Storage,5," Western Digital has a real winner on their hands with the My Book Duo 12TB.  The external raid device has a wide range of flexibility.  The My Book Duo offers the ability to set the RAID as either 0 (default out of the box), 1, or JBOD.  Two Western Digital Red 6TB drives are inside providing the total 12TB of storage. While being in RAID 0 on a USB3 port, read/write rates held steady between 270-285MBps.  RAID 1 and JBOD, on the other hand, floated between 150-190MBps for both read and write speeds.The addition of the two USB3 ports on the back of the unit, while sharing the bandwidth of the main USB3 back to the PC, afford the ability to plug items for either charging or light transfers.  This proved especially helpful to charge a wireless headset.Power saving is also a tremendous plus.  The Duo will power down when the computer its connected to shuts down or goes to sleep.  Many other external drives requiring external power will continue to run until they are manually turned off or unplugged."," These drives run hot.  The ambient temperature around the unit for the majority of these tests remained around 70F(21C).  After transferring data to the Duo for several hours, the drives began to alarm on my WHS due to temperatures of 127F (53C).  Western Digital did not include any active cooling on the Duo choosing to, instead, rely thermodynamics to draw cool air through the vents in the bottom of the unit and expel hot air out of the top vents.  For intermittent transfers, this works well but not prolonged periods.  The specifications for the WD Red 6TB drives indicate this is within their operating temperature range of 32F(0C) to 158F(70C).  Heat affects the longevity of all hard drives so this is a little concerning especially for an external hard drive RAID of this size."," I performed many of the prolonged tests by connecting the WD My Duo 12TB to WHSv1, FreeNAS, and Windows 8.  With a little tweaking on the server side, WHSv1 recognized the entire 12TB and added was to the storage pool.  In order to allow Drive Extender to perform correctly, the Duo was set to JBOD.  FreeNAS and Windows 8 required minimal interaction in order to get the Duo to work in any of the three available RAIDs.On a side note, I was able to control the heat issue by placing a USB powered fan on the top of the unit.  By doing this, the temperatures came down to a more respectable 97F(36C).  Again, the WD Reds can operate up to 158F according to Western Digital but this was for my own piece of mind.",9,9
9SIA1UH4N09757,22-236-731,8/11/2014 3:03:49 PM,Donald T.,Very Nice!,5," It's exceedingly rare for me to ever give a glowing, two-thumbs up review on anything. But with this item, I pretty much have to.Capacity--I received the 12-Terabyte model that came equipped with two six-Terabyte drives in RAID 0 configuration. That's pretty amazing, considering that the first hard drive I ever bought, back in the 1980s, had ten Megabytes of capacity, and was about the same physical size as this unit.Linux Compatibility--I have no idea why Western Digital isn't advertising this. When I plugged this unit into my Lubuntu 13.10 machine, it was recognized immediately, and was automatically mounted under the ""/media"" directory. Lubuntu has the built-in capability of reading and writing to NTFS formatted drives, so there was no need to reformat the unit to use it with Linux. In fact, I now have backup files from the Linux machine peacefully co-existing with backup files from my Windows machines. (The only other Linux distro that I tried this with was Clonezilla, and it also worked perfectly.)Speed--All of my Windows machines are so old that they all have the old USB 2.0 hubs. So, when I plugged the unit into them, I found that it was no faster than using a regular, cheap hard drive in a cheap enclosure. However, when I plugged the unit into my Lubuntu machine, the only one in the house that's new enough to have USB 3.0, I was blown away by the speed. When I did an ""rsync"" of a rather large directory, I was totally unprepared for how fast the operation would complete. (You need USB 3.0 to take advantage of RAID 0 write speeds.)Backup Software Compatibility--The unit comes with its own backup software, but I also had it working perfectly with the backup utility that's built into Windows 7. As I type this, I'm using Clonezilla to create a backup image of a Windows XP drive on this unit. Clonezilla also recognized the unit immediately, and auto-mounted it as ""/dev/sdb1"".Ease of Use--I've tried it with Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Lubuntu Linux. It's just an easy plug-and-play with all of them. (Note that if you plug it into a Windows XP machine, it will automatically install the drivers, but it still won't work. That's okay, because Western Digital doesn't advertise the 12-Terabyte model as being XP-compatible. Besides, there's still Clonezilla.)Flexibility--The unit comes configured as RAID 0. However, you can easily change it to either RAID 1, or to use both drives independently"," So far, none. Of course, I haven't had it long enough to evaluate the durability of the drives, but I have found in the past that Western Digital's warranty service is absolutely superb."," The software that comes with this unit is nice, and does have nice features. Once you install it on a Windows Vista, 7, or 8 computer, it will automatically backup your data files as you write them to the computer's hard drive. However, be aware that you can only install the software on one computer at a time. According to the owner's manual, if you want to install the software on another computer, you have to completely erase everything from the unit's drives, and then download a fresh copy of the software from the Western Digital site. However, installing the software on one computer does not prevent you from moving the unit to another computer, and using a different backup program.For hard-drive backup, you can download the Acronis software for free. But, I found that it actually only gives the options to backup individual partitions, rather than the whoe drive. So, rather than use Acronis, I'll just stick to Clonezilla.",9,9

As mentioned in the title and the Pros section, this is a fast drive!  In CrystalDiskMark, using the USB 3.0 interface, it scored 245-256-226-255 (SeqRead=245MB/s, SeqWrite=256MB/s, RandomRead 512KB=226MB/s, RandomWrite 512KB=255MB/s). That squashes my next fastest USB 3.0 drive (A Seagate 3TB Backup Plus) which scored 125-123-49-75, which in turn easily beat my fastest eSata 2TB external drive setup by 30%.  But, those were all empty drive stats and, frankly, who uses an empty drive?!  As part of this testing, I put data on the drive and re-tested.  I started with 300GB and then bumped it up to a full terabyte (so well over half full) and, with both amounts, I had almost identical outcomes. So, with 1TB of the typical data I store, this brought the scores down a bit to 213-246-212-243. Down from super-awesome, however, is still awesome! Note: the Random read/write speeds are on par with the Sequential Read/Write speeds, which I haven’t ever seen!  In addition to the straight-up speed increases on the sequential reads, this seems to be the real strength of this drive.  Knowing this, I believe the best possible use for this drive would be a situation where the user needed a portable/external data store that performs similar an internal drive would be a good utilization scenario.  Sure, it would do fine as a backup drive, but is quite pricy for that purpose, as you can get double the storage space for less money.  That’s my take on it… In conclusion, if it were possible to dock it a half an egg, I would do so for the bulkiness, but as I cannot, I will give it the full five.  I love new tech and especially love it when it does what it says it will do!",2,2

Like any modern USB drive, I plugged it in and it just worked. The computer recognized it as a 1.81 TB NTFS disk (2,000,298,872,576 bytes, or a hair over 2 TB using the drive manufacturers' power-of-ten definition of GB and TB).Newegg states a 1 year warranty but the printed documentation says it's 3 years, which is good.It is very quiet at idle or in use. Compared to my desktop it's essentially inaudible.I exercised this drive over five days including a full disk test and truecrypt encryption (26 hours each). During this time there were no problems and the drive operated reliably with consistent performance.Over USB 2.0 (yes, it's time for an upgrade) HD Tune reported 20.3 MB/s average throughput and 12.9 ms access. Unexpectedly, I found the performance best with files larger than the stated 1 GB cache, with one exception:10 GB file -- write 21.2 MB/s, read 24.2 MB/s.1.25 GB file -- write 18.4 MB/s, read 20.2 MB/s (in this case the 1 GB cache should have helped dramatically).Here is where it gets interesting:0.5 GB file -- write 16.5 MB/s, read 46.5 MB/s (no disk activity indicated), second read 17.7 MB/s, third read 17.9 MB/sThe result I observed with the 0.5 GB file, where the first read after a write was very fast with no disk activity, and subsequent reads were normal speed with disk activity, was completely repeatable.All performance measurements were made prior to TrueCrypt encryption."," I only observed the cache in obvious use in one scenario, when reading back a file smaller than 1 GB immediately after writing it, and only the first time this file was read. That's unexpected and it's difficult to understand why that would be the case. I can understand not caching the writes to preserve data integrity in case of power loss, but discarding the cache contents after a read makes no sense to me.The plastic case feels thin and a little cheap. It's fine for stationary use but I'd think twice about hauling it around without some kind of a protective case."," Like many external drives these days, there is no power switch. It will spin up when the computer wakes up and spin down when the computer hibernates or powers off.There is no fan and the plastic case gets a little warm to the touch. I measured 33 degrees C on the case exterior with the drive idling and 38 degrees C with the drive in use. Newegg lists this as “USB 2.0 | eSATA | FW400 | FW800” which is incorrect. There's a single USB 3.0 connector (backward compatible to 2.0 of course).This drive was a solid performer but currently it's 30% more expensive than other models that lack the 1 GB cache. I would be a little disappointed to pay that premium and not see more benefit from the cache.",2,2

If you choose to call them, reference the above article because the tech i spoke to thought the drive did not encrypt itself until you set a password. Ask the tech if you move the drives into a different enclosure of the same kind if they will work, that will force them to admit your data is just one (not two) failures away from being irrevocably unrecoverable.

This is however the default state of any disk drive, i.e. if it fails you loose your data.- offers RAID1 to increase data loss protection at the expense of reduced storage capacity. This is possibly the preferred state for someone that wishes to maintain an offline, i.e. only online when needed, backup/archive solution, i.e. bring it online to do the backup save/recover action and take it offline when not doing this.- offers a clean attractive 'form factor'.", - the one major observation that I have with this type of external storage is that there is no 'power switch'. I can understand anyone howling about this not being an issue but my point is that if I want to set this up then I don't want to have to plug that little power connector in and then remove it after every use as it seems that power connection is a 'weak link' and if this is meant to be 'primary online' storage then that is something that should really be reviewed in comparison to a large HDD installed internally. The front with it's small number of indicators would be a great place for a touch sensitive 'power button' or simply put a rocker switch on the back...," - the comments about capacity are annoying to me. There seems to be a problem with the vendor stating '8TB' when it is actually '8Tb'. The size (capacity) of the 'B|b' is important, and B is a binary indicator while b is a decimal indicator. So because WD gets it 'wrong' and states B instead of b it gets propagated. Drives are capacity described in decimal instead of binary so know this if you 'do the math' on 8Tb by repeatedly dividing by 1024 (1 binary K) instead of 1000 (1 decimal k) you will find that you arrive at ~ 7.27TB which is ~ exactly the same as 8Tb.",3,3

With any WD external drive the software always seems kinda lame.  There are multiple pieces of software that come with the drive and the basic WD utility for managing the drive for like picking raid configuration, sleep timer, drive check etc... isn't that bad but could look cooler, very simple functionality with no extra junk which I like. I'm more referring to the backup software that it comes with, not that I was going to use it as a back up but could have been a lot nicer backup software, it integrates with dropbox, not sure why, and apparently there's a paid version, the version that comes with the drive is the free version and there's like a spot in the program that says like upgrade to pro or something like that and I have all programs that do that."," I would definitely recommend this product.  I use it mainly for storing media for a plex server and I picked it over a NAS system because I figured it would be faster and I think I was right,   I get 288MByte/sec read and 280MByte/sec write in raid 0 its default setup which is awesome using the USB 3.0 cable it came with.  A weird issue I have with it which is probably just a setting on my laptop is that every time I reboot my laptop which the drive is connected to I have to change the USB 3.0 port the drive is connected to.  When the computer boots back up after reboot the drive doesn't show, if I unplug it and plug it back in my PC makes a noise like it connected but there's no trace of it not even a missing driver but when I change ports works no problem.  7.27TB is what my PC actually sees in usable storage for those wondering what the formatted capacity actually is.  It's very quiet. It comes with 3 pieces of software I recommend only installing the WD Utilities one and maybe the drive security one if you need something like that, the backup software I didn't really like, not that I was using it as a backup anyway,  didn't really use the security program but it seemed straight forward, and the WD utilities program was very straight forward and serves its purpose.  It does vibrate a little bit which is expected with mechanical drives, I put it on a mouse pad and it solved it.  Again really quiet either way.  I really like this drive and $350 for two 4TB drives and a dual bay raid enclosure really isn't that bad considering to buy a 4TB WD red drive right now would cost $150 each thats $300 for the drives and $50 for the enclosure.",1,1

This comes with software selections of eco-manager, disk formatter 2, cache control tool, Ramdisk, Backup Utility, restore tool and TurboPC EX File Copy. I find this to be a very nice software selection and of better use than the others that I've tried.Great control of when you do the backups even down to the minute and how often.USB 3.0 backwards compatible, two USB 2.0.Cache control for the improved speeds and it is fast.A three-year warranty and 24 seven customer support. That's hard to beat.You can use this on a PC or Mac and with the 2 TB size. It's a great amount of flexibility for the average user. It seems to me that very few of us even do a true backup process and this makes it easy for anyone to bail to do one. The software is easy to understand and easy for a novice to use, while still having options for those that need it."," This is able to have a small fan installed in the case, wonder why it doesn't come with one?"," Even though you can go to the website. There is programming on the DriveStation that I recommend making a copy of for use later on. I saw no reason to keep it on the hard drive while using it for backups. It's a non-restricted hard drive with a really nice backup software package and the unique cache control system that gives the advertised speeds. I got curious when I noticed that the TorboPC EX File Copy was the control window when I was transferring data from a different external drive to my PC so I tried a few different cash sizes to see if there was, in effect in the transfer speeds and yes, the more cash, the faster it was. I also noticed that my W.E.I went from 7.7 to 6.0 when I had the RamDisk cache on vs: off. The DriveStation available cache didn't seem to have any effect, though on my FPS during gaming or speeds. I see my computer running at. So depending on your need and how often you backup you can turn up the RamDisk cache amount when you want the ultrafast backup speeds and adjust it lower for incremental backups, gaming, or any other reason. It makes it a little effort, but it also seems to make it simply good options, it's very easy to change or turn on and off.When set Windows recognizes this and it's awesome that you can control your backups by the hour or down to the minute and as often as you'd like. For professionals and offices. This is a perfect individual backup device and for the homeowner. It's a great way to have a set and forget backup system.

And it installs to the root of the C: drive by default (can't remember if there was an option to change this).In my experience, these drives aren't living up to the hype bestowed upon them by various review sites including CNET."," I purchased 4 of these on May 27 to use as rotating backups for my 2x3TB Seagate SATA 6.0Gb/s drives (model Constellation ES.2 ST33000651NS) that are connected via SATA 6.0Gb/s to a Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UP4 TH motherboard.The DriveStations arrived quickly and were well packaged.  The enclosure for the drives is plastic and feels kind of cheap, but I'm sure it will stand up to normal use.Upon connecting one to a USB 3.0 port on a Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UP4 TH motherboard and prior to installing the DriveNavigator software, I used Windows Explorer to copy ~100 GB consisting almost entirely of large (>100 MB) files from one of the Seagates to the DriveStation.  I was disappointed to only average about 140 MB/s with peaks of about 170 MB/s.  This test was repeated with all 4 drives and the results were very similar.I then installed the DriveNavigator software, verified that the motherboard's BIOS was up to date (it was), and verified that Windows 8 was fully patched and up to date (it was).  The test was repeated and there was no noticeable difference in write speeds.As a final test, I connected one of the drives to a different PC that is running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit and has an Intel motherboard (BOXDH77DF).  I was copying large files from a Samsung 840 SATA 6.0Gb/s SSD drive and once again barely averaged 140 MB/s.The main reason I bought these drives was for the advertized write speeds.  On the box Buffalo shows a write speed of 408.1 MB/s when using an Intel 3770K, 4GB DDR3, Gigabyte GA-Z77X-D3H, and Windows 8 Pro 64-bit.  The box compares the 408.1 MB/s of the DriveStation to 172.9 MB/s for a standard USB 3.0 hard drive and 35.8 MB/s for a standard USB 2.0 hard drive.Since I wasn't even at the top-end of the ""standard USB 3.0 hard drive"" range, I decided to email Buffalo support.  They were quick to reply, but this was their response:""Thank you for contacting Buffalo Technologies, I apologize for any inconvenience.We here at the Buffalo support team are responsible for ensuring the basic operation of our devices. There are too many variables for us to accurately diagnose read/write speeds on external hard drives. As such, I'm afraid I can offer no suggestions on how to improve the performance of the unit.""I can understand their point, but they could have at least suggested something to try.  Like trying a 3rd party file copy utility like TeraCopy (which is something I plan to try when time permits).  And it's not like my test environments were totally different from the one that apparently achieved the 408.1 MB/s write speed.To anyone considering this drive for the advertized write speeds: don't expect any help from Buffalo support if your results fall short of their claims.",2,4

I just want to save my C Drove clone image file on an external drive about once a month.  I found however that the included software somehow would not allow my clone software to save the image on this hard drive. I then deleted the software and found I could only save small files. If I wanted to save say a 10Gig file the hard drive would just freeze up and do nothing. I then even tried formatting the hard drive and that was also next to impossible to do.  So after spending 6 frustrating hours of trying to get this drive to accept downloads without using the included software I gave up and sent it back for a refund.  I later bought a plug and play drive with no software and that works fantastic.  I am one who is getting tired of  smart software that one has to accept that can cause problems  when you just want a drive to download your files with your own software if need be.The good news however is that I think the Drive is of good quality and fast for those who love to upload to a cloud in the sky and do not mind 3rd party software telling you where you can download stuff.The other good news is that Newegg gave  back my money with no hassle so I will still continue to buy from Newegg as they have super fast shipping I might add.

I copied over a 1.4GB file to test the speeds and on windows 8 it transferred at an impressive 117MBs on average. I do not like posting such results because they vary from situation to situation. A simple update can improve your transfer speeds if you haven't updated your USB drivers since you got your computer, and one chipset may perform better than another so it's really not fair to say how a drive performs when it really depends on the engine your putting it in. The windows 7 HTPC hovered around the 90MBs area and 70MBs from another USB drive.  However after an update of my USB 3.0 drivers, I gained some speed and am running as fast as the windows 8 sony did!The software is easy to learn and installed easy enough. Did have to reboot and upgrade and reboot again. Plays well with others! I have a MyBook 4TB and no problems. I used the WD Tools and did a complete scan of the drive and all the test passed.I was having negative results at first, but after finding there was in fact an available update for my USB 3.0 controller, things couldn't be running better! Again, speed testing results need to be taken with a grain of salt! I went from 90MBs to 120MBs after updating my USB 3.0 drivers. And I emphasize that the drivers section from my manufacturer website show my drivers as the latest available update!  I found out my USB 3.0 was ASMedia and had to do some research to find v1.16.12.0. How many users put in that much effort? So if they don't have impressive speeds, that's not fair to point the finger at the disk drive!"," Besides your basic cons like small cord and bright led, the one that really might hit home with some users is not being able to get the encryption part working. When I tried to use WD Security, I got the Security on this drive has not been enabled error box. The SmartWare will also say No writable partition found. If you look at the WD Quick View in taskbar, and you see n/a under Locked for your ultra or if you see No writable partition found in SmartWare, you're going to have issues. You can do a few different things to work around them, like I tried with enable auto mount for user and removing the software and such, but if you want it working like it should, you will need to fix the problem. (And no it isn't the drive unless you just want to blame the drive for not working 100% with faulty drivers from your computer.)I updated the passports firmware which didn't fix the issue, but probably a good thing to do anyway. I changed USB ports which gave erratic results. It helped some but the problem of getting this to work properly was still there.  I had perfect results from the Vaio with windows 8 and the drive worked on my HTPC if I uninstalled all the software and did a whole lot of rebooting and unplugging and plugging back in, I tested this drive by exhausting all possible means of getting this to work so I could write an informative review. I have found a fixAwhile back, I was testing the speeds of an SSD and wasn't at all pleased with how they did on my USB 3.0. So I went back to my manufacturers support site and downloaded the newest USB 3.0 drivers which last updated in 2012. An indication that I wouldn't be seeing anymore updates for my motherboard. The speed has increased and things were fine. Till I got this passport ultra. At first I was ready to blame the drive for having issues, because it just wouldn't work on my HTPC properly. After going through a few hoops to get it to work, I tried it out on a 3rd machine that was running windows 7 professional and it didn't have any issues there. That got me to think it wasn't the drive or windows 7, but my HTPC. I spent some time trying to find the manufacturer of my USB 3.0 drivers. Now I don't recommend messing with something that isn't broke, so I never had a desire to update my USB drivers past the manufacturers supplied updates. ASMedia v1.10.1.0 from May 2012 is what I thought I was stuck with, because it wasn't easy to find newer drivers. A bit of searching and I have managed to find ASMedia 104x v1.16.12.0. I downloaded and installed these drivers, rebooted and the drive works fine!  I gained a whole lot of speed from it too! So in a way, I'm glad this has come about because taking the time to do this search for updated USB 3.0 drivers has given me a performance boost on my machine!"," I bet if I wasn't so stubborn with making this work on USB 3.0, I could have done this on USB 2.0 and been done troubleshooting the problems hours earlier. If you have issues, try using your USB 2.0 port and see if that solves it. If it does, then you will need better USB 3.0 drivers like I did. I also recommend if you have issues with the drive not working, try testing your drive with another cable. If you don't have an extra one you can borrow from another device, and you don't have any friends around that can let you borrow one to test it out, your local repair shop or reseller may have one they can lend you. Just because you think your drivers are up to date doesn't mean you can't update them even more! It may not be easy, but it is well worth it!",2,3

Plug into USB 3.0 slot.Nothing happens, then Windows 7 (x64 Pro) says that the device FAILED to install. This is a portable hard drive. Is this a hilarious joke? Is Win7 pulling my leg?Step 2. Uninstall that hardware, hard reset, try again.Again, Windows tells me it has failed to install this drive automatically. However, the drive is showing up now in My Computer. Fine, I'll take it.Step 3. Speed test.Copied 100 GB (20 DVD iso files) to the drive. Speed averaged about 85MB/s and peaked at about 92MB/s. At least... for a while. Then it tanked to 45MB/s. Then it came back to 92MB/s. The time remaining fluctuated dramatically between 30 min and 1h for the first 30 min.By the time it was done, it took 55 minutes, which is a sad 30MB/s average.Step 4. Speed test v2.Copied about 2,000 files averaging 10MB each to the disk. Averaged only 7 MB/s.Step 5. Software?I gave ""SmartWare"" a whirl and it didn't play nicely with the organization of my (internal) drives, didn't understand that I might need to back up from a portable drive to a portable drive, and didn't seem especially useful to me. I'd rather use Windows' backup feature and do daily backups of other stuff manually. So if you don't care either way, don't let this software be a selling point -- it shouldn't be.And, frankly, if backups are your issue, why aren't you using RAID, NAS backups, and other more serious solutions in the first place? Consider that.Overall, I am not even remotely impressed.I am totally unimpressed with the ""cloud"" features. You're paying extra to use the ALREADY FREE service of DropBox? Bogus.The drive itself is in a relatively sturdy housing, but it's still plastic and it's small and thin. I would not chuck this in my backpack for fear of damage.

If you really need software like that, you are better off with a real solution, not the free WD throw-ins that come with this drive.

If your drive isn't working, good luck getting the drivers from it. How much is a CD these days? 2 cents? 1 cent? Save a penny on that crummy velour case or spend that penny on giving me the ""drivers"" on a CD.But, these drives are really cheap. They are ""entry level"" storage. They will probably do the casual person just fine for day-to-day storage or something. Put your MP3s on here or something. But if you're serious about your data and/or require actual speed, this external drive just doesn't cut the mustard. WD is supposed to make high-quality, high-performance stuff.

With digital photos, games, movies, tv shows, mobile device backups, and much more to store on modern-day machines, it's nice to know that you can plug in a drive as additional storage or for redundancy of data as is my case. This drive is advertised as working with Windows 8/8.1 but it's a USB controller connected to an HDD so it will work with any machine with a USB port regardless of OS. The drive runs cool to the touch even when running my Mac OS X Time Machine backups. I also transferred 1.2TB of data in bulk between my machine and then copied all of the data onto other redundant storage --the transfer was exceptionally quick. I was actually surprised how fast the drive read and wrote over USB 3.0 since it is a standard spindle drive and not an SSD. The unit is simple, plug it in, format to desired file system, and off you go. I've reformatted this unit 5 times now (Mac OS Journaled, Mac OS Journaled Case Senstive, exfat, FAT, and NTFS) and each iteration worked as expected.I ran CCleaner's free space cleaning on the device and it performs as well as internal drives on most of my other machines. Would definitely buy a higher capacity drive in the future should the need arise. A+, Seagate!"," No native ability to upgrade/replace drive. I'm sure you could pop the unit open and put in a new HDD if you wanted to increase capacity or replace it with solid state storage but that's a known factor going into purchasing this unit and not worth taking away any stars. The only real complaint I have is the size of the power plug. The transformer is enclosed in the plug itself which means the plug becomes a huge monstrosity taking up multiple slots on my power strip. Having the plug either be modular (think laptop power supply) or formatted like a slim plug adapter (eg. macbook pro charger/netgear power plugs) such that the unit would only take up one space and just would end up being tall, this would be much better."," Overall I'm very happy with the unit. I currently just leave it as extra storage on my CloudStation NAS which seems to be the best use for me. The CloudStation has 2.0TB as well, so this is a simple redundant drive. I would definitely recommend these units to friends and family looking to expand storage capacity on a laptop or otherwise.",None,None

These speeds were also reflected in transfers of large video files.The two USB 3.0 ports on the front are very welcome and allowed me to charge my Android tablet and also access a thumb drive as though it were plugged directly into the PC's USB port.Appearance is quite stylish and the drive does not get excessively warm.The Seagate Dashboard software is already installed on the device and does work, although you have to register to use the mobile app or cloud storage."," Only minor Cons for me but here they are:There is some noise when accessing files or backing up many small files, but I've heard worse.I would prefer Seagate used the more sturdy USB 3.0 B-Type connector at the rear rather than Micro B.A base with wide feet that the enclosure could slip into would give me some reassurance that the drive could not fall over with a slight knock. At least it has small rubber feet to raise it for ventilation though.I would also like to see a power switch at the rear, so I can completely power it down when not in use without unplugging it.The Dashboard software requires registration to use the Mobile app (I won't be using the cloud storage). Also I could only back up my Android tablet via wi-fi even though it was connected directly to one of the front USB 3.0 ports."," This is pretty good value, in my opinion, for the capacity and performance this drive provides, in addition to its USB 3.0 hub functionality.

N82E16822179032,22-179-032,10/10/2016 1:51:31 AM,Patrick S.,Back it up,5," The Seagate Backup plus is a USB back up drive that comes shipped with software to monitor your system and back it up incrementally or completely. The drive shipped very fast by Newegg and was appropriately packaged. You can use the software or not and just use it as another drive. The speeds were as it should be with actual speed of 180Mb/s with transfers (USB3.0 required for this speed but is backwards compatible to USB2.0). If you choose to use the in included software the backup is usable without the software. What I mean is if you back up you system with the Seagate software you can disconnect the drive and plug it into any PC and recover any file that has been backed up without the software.  The drive was in good shape with 1 hour and 4 powers on recorded. It passed Crystal Disk smart test read and HDtune with green light all the way.  The cords were long, power brick small, good looking and easy. The Seagate software is the same software they have been using for years and it just works plan and simple."," First off registering the product was a pain. The issue is the password security on Seagate’s web site.  Type it in one time wrong and boom. You have to reset it. The next problem is with the free 200Gb storage on OneDrive. You have to jump threw a few hoops to get that. I need to do a complete review on OneDrive. Microsoft, Google has you beat hands down. Your overhead is awful, system is slow and it’s a pain to work with. (This is the second time I’ve dealt with OneDrive)  But I want to get the whole experience of the Drive and what is being offered. As far as the Seagate Back up plus I have to issues with it. So I won’t take anything away from the review. For some reason, it would not show up on my router USB but I’m not sure why. TP-Link Archer C5400. I used it on my HTPC to back up all my computers on my network. 4 Tb of data."," It’s a great back up drive power USB ports in front, large capacity, easy to use and set up.

N82E16822179032,22-179-032,10/9/2016 11:18:17 AM,Nicholas T.,"Great capacity, decently fast",5," 6 TB is a pretty decent amount for an external drive. In my tests with real data I was able to achieve a pretty solid 90 MB/s write speed to this device from my NAS when plugged into a USB 3.0 port. Read speeds from the device were around 130 MB/s which definitely isn't bad for a USB drive. When copying large files from my desktop to the Seagate Hub, I was able to achieve speeds bursting up to 190 MB/s write and 200 MB/s read before dropping back down to the 90 MB/s range.However, the performance was much worse when transferring many small files - around the 1 MB/s range.I consider these speeds to be above average for an external drive and I was definitely happy with the performance.So far the drive seems to work perfectly, I'll update the review if I experience any issues with reliability. I can confirm that it works fine with Mac OS, Windows, and when attached to a NAS."," The noise levels were acceptable, but when writing a lot of small files you could definitely hear it working. I wouldn't want to keep it on my desk or anything if you are constantly writing. When it's not active though it's very quiet and you can barely tell it's on."," Be aware that there is no redundancy here. If the single drive inside the enclosure fails and the drive contained the only copy of your data you could be in trouble. I'd suggest using this as a backup drive as intended, not as primary storage.This product also came with 200 GB of OneDrive cloud storage for two-years, which is nice. You could potentially use that to store your most important files and at least have those in the case of drive failure.",None,None
N82E16822179032,22-179-032,10/6/2016 1:24:41 PM,Patrick H.,A good external drive with some nice extras,5," The Seagate Backup Plus Hub is all about dark blue plastic, both shiny and matte.  It has what appears to be vents on two sides although it appears it’s designed to stand up with the vents on one side on the bottom.  It has 4 small rubber feet at least on that side.  Maybe the heat is supposed to rise up and out the vents on the top.  I’m not sure but that’s the way I’m going to orient it.The Backup Plus Hub arrives with nothing but a small quick start guide pamphlet in about a dozen languages with only the most cursory instructions on setting up the drive.  But then you don’t really need much instruction.  Plug in the power adaptor and the USB 3 cable and hook the USB cable to your computer and you’re in business.  There is a white Seagate swirl that lights up to show you the drive is connected.  It’s bright but you can turn it off in the Dashboard Program.  I’d like to say the drive was silent but you can hear the dull rumble of the heads seeking, especially on a wooden desk.  It’s not obtrusive but it’s there.The Seagate Backup Plus Hub 6 TB comes formatted with approximately 5.4 TB available.  There is some software on the drive when first used.  I’m going to ignore the Mac software because I don’t use an Apple device but just be aware it’s there.  There is an icon labeled ‘Start Here Win’ and when clicked all it does it take you to a warranty registration site.  It’s easy, just name and e-mail address.  Then another icon takes you to the Seagate site where you download and install the Seagate Dashboard software.  This is a basic, no frills backup.  It lets you choose to back up everything or be selective.  I chose a dozen folders on both my boot SSD and my 4 TB Files hard drive.  I left the Backup Plus to its own devices and went back a few hours later to see something had interrupted the backup and shut it down.  But a few hours later it restarted and finished.  The backup log showed it took about 5 hours for this initial backup which was over a hundred gigs.I copied 12 gigs of mixed type files from the hard drive of my production machine to the backup Plus and it took 6:37 per Teracopy.  13.2 gigs of files copied from a USB 3 external hard drive to the Backup Plus Hub using the built-in USB 3 port took 3:43.  The USB 3 ports built into the Backup Plus Hub appear to act as pass through ports because I can use my ASUS USB 3.1 Boost on any drive I have plugged into the Backup Plus Hub as well as the drive itself.Ran Crystal Disk Mark and was surprised the drive performed so well.  I got 204 MB/s read and 190 MB/s write.  This is quite good for a USB 3 drive.  And, despite my fears, the drive seems to stay relatively cool to the touch.I did manage to find a way to set when the drive sleeps.  That is important to me because you don’t want it running continuously.  This is under ‘management’ and it also lets you turn the swirl light on or off and to test the drive.  They all work fine."," The Dashboard program seems to be a bit cumbersome to use.  I selected ‘continuous’ backup plan and I decided I wanted to change it to the ‘snapshot’ mode but I can’t seem to find a way to do that without going back and reselecting the various folders I want to backup.  That said, the Dashboard program lets you select any of your folders to backup but it defaults to everything and you have to laboriously uncheck every folder if you don’t want it to backup.  If you have a lot of folders on your documents hard drive it can take a while.The USB 3 cable seems too short for the intended use of this drive.  I’d think the user would want to connect to the USB 3 ports on the back of their computer and then place the Backup Plus Hub on their desks where they would have good access to the USB 3 ports on the front.  The cable is just a little too short for this on my rig, making me plug it into one of the front mounted ports. ", The Seagate Backup Plus Hub does everything it promises.  It’s relatively speedy and not noisy in a bad way.  I’m not a real fan of the Dashboard software but it works and it’s free.  The 2 USB 3 ports on the front have worked with every drive and memory key I’ve thrown at them and they are true pass thru ports and only interact with the Backup Plus Hub if you want to copy data.  The drive itself never got more than warm to the touch even copying multi gig batches of data.  The USB 3 cable is annoying short but that’s not a make or break problem.  I’d say this was a good external drive with some nice extras.,None,None

After 24 hours it is 26% done, I checked off continuous backup so I guess it is always working. It is about 1.5TB of data that I am backing into it.

You can set your own schedule or use continuous so every time you changed your computer it keeps up with that change. I actually use both so if I need to roll it back I have it keep a weekly back up.

I also in transferring over 500 gigs of information got 102 Mbps transfer speed out of it. It takes a 120 volt plug in included with it and  it comes with the USB 3.0 cable. I cut 4 small rubber pads for it to keep it off desktop table. Cords are plenty long enough to have it set on your computer table and keep it hooked up at all times.

After plugging the drive in, I opened My Computer and found the Seagate Backup Plus drive, all 6TB of it, had indeed installled correctly and was ready for use.  A Start_ Here _Win Icon is installed from Seagate and if you click that lcon and sign up with Seagate, the Seagate DashBoard software program is available for download.  Once installed, Seagate Dashboard gives you several options including PC Backup and Restore a Backup.  Also, Mobile Device backup is available.  You would be required to create a Seagate Mobile Device backup account, which I declined to do for now, and download the Seagate free backup App to your mobile device. I download the APP to my tablet, but declined to create the acount with Seagate for the time being. Seagate requires the password to my email account which I am unwilling to give at this time. I will mention signing up at Seagate is very simple and two great offers of 200GB One Drive Cloud Storage free for 2 years as well as Seagate's offer to provide their Rescue Data Recovery plan for 2 years for about ten bucks are available.  A few other observations:Seagate Dashboard software is straight forward and user friendly.  Account sign up is fast and simple. With the software you can easily create backup files for multiple computers, notebooks, etc. at home as well as office.The two port USB 3.0 charging hub recharges your device while plugged into the Seagate Backup plus. Multiple devices as well as multiple storage hard drives can be accessed simultaneously. The Drive comes formatted NTFS from Seagate.The form factor is small, about the size of a 2.5 hard drive.  The enclosure has a gloss black finish with a single, non bothersome,  power indicator low level white light on the front.Two performance tests I ran:Ran synthetic ATTO Disk Benchmark  3.05v. software immediately after setup.ATTO results for a 64MB file transfer test:  WRITE 40.124 MB/Sec.  READ 39.827 MB/Sec.Using my computer's 3.0 connector I copied a 66GB 785 itemYoutube video file from my internal storage WD 2TB 7200 RPM 64MB Cache SATA 6.0 Enterprise hard drive to the Seagate Backup Plus.  Copy time was 37 minutes which I consider to be fast where a USB 3.0 hard drive is involved.  Average transfer rate during the 66GB video file transfer test was approximately 33MB/Sec.  My compurer has a Core i7 4790K @4.2 GHz with 32 GB RAM.  The transferred video files were in perfect order and played flawlessly when accessed from the Seagate Backup Plus storage drive. Obviously you can store a massive amount of video and music files with this portable unit.I have one unique use for this 6TB Seagate Plus storage drive.  I can use the Seagate Backup Plus as the storage drive for my continuous live multiple IP Camera video.  ISpy is a free download video surveillance software that, when available, can use a storage device such as this to record and store live surveillance video.   If you are like me and have IP cameras and want to store live surveillance video, this portable drive is a perfec solution. Especially if you have multiple locations running Ispy surveillance video.", None., I found the Seagate Backup Plus Hub 6TB 3.0 USB storage drive to be state-of-the-art in every way possible.

It is small for the amount of memory it can hold and is very reliable. I use it to transfer data to and from my home computer, my laptop, as well as computers at the college I attend. This is very convenient for many large projects in my class because there are often many files of great size that I need to transfer quickly in between classes. The USB 3.0 and fast speed of the hard drive itself makes this a breeze and has not once lost any data.There are some features for this hard drive that separates itself from others like it that are optional. For example there is an encryption function that locks and encrypts all the files on the hard drive so that you need a password to use it. Once again, this is nice for when I'm at the college and I need to be sure my hard drive isn't stolen and data isn't pulled from it. Also, I mentioned the hard drive is reliable and I haven't lost any data. You may think ""duh, that's what it's supposed to do"" but many hard drives out there don't hold up as good as this one.

9SIA24G47M8352,22-178-940,11/18/2016 8:47:36 AM,Daniel M.,"Good, sturdy archive drive for Type-C early adopters, with a few inconveniences",4," - Massive capacity. There are only a handful of drives on the market that are this size, multi-drive NAS systems notwithstanding. There's enough space for me to backup complete images of primary drives three times over.- Sturdy construction. Many external hard drives and enclosures are cheaply made and feel like they might fall apart. This does not: it is heavy and has a tough, all-aluminum enclosure with no few seams or pieces of plastic. I have no concerns about this standing up to rough usage e.g. while traveling.- Heat dissipation. The all-aluminum enclosure is a much better heatsink than plastic. A number of my old 7200 RPM Barracudas would get very hot under load in plastic enclosures.- USB Type-C connection. Let's face it: Type-C is the way of the future. In a few years, I sincerely hope we can finally be in a place where power, data transfer, video feed, etc. can all go through a single, reversible cable. It's great that Seagate is moving forward in this regard.- Sequential performance. CrystalDiskMark showed 206 MB/s sequential read and 188 MB/s sequential write with a queue depth of 1, marginally higher than a 1TB 7200 RPM WD Black drive from just a few years ago. The fact that this drive has 8x capacity, is external, and is powered by just that small cable is icing on the cake.- Noise. This drive is very quiet. I don’t have any empirical data for noise, but the hard drive activity never became audible above the hum of the CPU fan in my desktop."," - Cable length. The USB 3.1 Type-C cable is only about a foot and a half long. This is fine if you're connecting it to a laptop on your desk that's right next to the drive, but for docking stations or desktop setups this is inconvenient. The lack of reliable aftermarket Type-C hubs and extension cables makes this hard to address.- Backwards compatibility. Only a USB 3.1 Type-C cable is provided. If you ever want to connect to a Type-A port, you'll have to take your chances with an aftermarket adapter. If you are concerned about your Type-C port being able to deliver enough power, you're out of luck since no power adapter was included. These little extras only add a tiny bit more to the cost of the product, but make it a lot easier to be an early adopter without sacrificing interoperability and convenience.- Weight. This thing is heavy! According to the spec sheet, it is 3.3 pounds, which is significantly heavier than my other 3.5"" drive + enclosure setups. While this weight feels nice in terms of sturdiness, it does make it a bit less portable. For this reason, I'd say it's more of an external drive to leave at home rather than one to carry around everywhere.- Random performance. CrystalDiskMark showed a paltry 0.6 MB/s random read and 7.4 MB/s random write with a queue depth of 1; one and two orders of magnitude slower than comparable drives. This is likely due to the Shingle Magnetic Recording (SMR) technology that incurs greater overhead when reading. Random performance usually isn't a big factor with backup drives storing large files, but the degree to which this is slower than regular magnetic HDDs is troubling.- Price. This drive commands a premium over the ST8000AS0002 bare drive inside. This is right on the edge of being worth it. The fact that this drive is bus-powered is cool, but I don't know if it's worth that premium."," - Bandwidth. While the USB 3.1 Gen 2 spec offers up to 10 Gbps, no magnetic hard drives will approach this throughout, certainly not a ~5400 RPM drive. So performance isn't really affected, positively or negatively, by this choice over USB 3.0/USB 3.1 Gen 1.- Test setup. I tested this drive connected to a desktop computer with a Gigabyte GA-Z170X-UD5 motherboard. For testing, files were copied from a Samsung 950 Pro NVMe SSD which almost certainly will not be a bottleneck.",5,5

It has very large storage capacity in a solid, cooling efficient enclosure that only requires a single USB-C cable for both I/O and power.  This world work well long as you don't intend to travel with the drive. The enclosure of the drive is designed to sit on a desktop, not to be carried around.  It's surprisingly heavy, and serves the function of the heat sinking the hard drive inside very well.  However, portable this drive is not.  I would not imagine carrying this unit inside a brief case or even a well padded backpack due to its weight and rigidity.  The only way to power this drive is via an USB 3.1 interface, however, because the drive uses a 8TB spinner hard drive, it tops out at a data transfer rate of about 1.5 Gbps (or ~ 190MBps).  I was able to sustain real life data read and write transfer rate of 192 MBps copying over 10 gigabyte of data between the innov8 drive connected via USB 3.1 and a Samsung 840 SSD internal drive connected via SATA III.  BTW, in the case of data transfer the innov8 is completely bottle-necked by the drive itself.  Using the same workstation computer with the same USB 3.1 interface connected to a Samsung T3 1TB external SSD portable drive provided close to 420MBps (3.44Gbps) read/write transfer rate, which is more than twice the rate seen on the innov8.  It seems the USB 3.1 interface is not even sweating dealing with this drive, a more common USB 3.0 interface could easily outgun the maximum transfer rate of the drive as well.  This makes the requirement for USB 3.1 quite limiting.  The USB 3.1 interface is used most due to the high power demand of the innov8 hared drive itself, as my attempt to connect the drive to a USB 3.0 interface resulted in sufficient interface power (the drive would spin up but not properly recognized by the computer). The drive also only comes with a very short USB-C cable at about 2 feet long, which makes connecting the drive to an USB 3.1 interface on the back of a workstation computer sitting under the desk in a tower case a bit tedious,.  It also makes the placement of the drive itself difficult. Overall, the innov8 is a large backup drive with good performance, 182 MBps sustained read/write speed is nothing to sneeze at.       I just wish the innov8 drive has more versatile power options (maybe a small AC adapter?) that would enable its connection with USB 3.0 interfaces.  That would make this drive a lot more versatile for use with a much wider range of computers.  Additionally, having a longer USB 3.1 USB-C cable would also make working with this drive a lot easier for anyone whom have their computers sitting below their desks.",None,None

It reached 198MB/s sequential read and 185MB/s sequential write, besting the USB 3.0 model's 142MB/s and 137MB/s.In terms of random performance, which by the way is not what you should be buying an external backup drive for, the Innov8 only hit 0.651MB/s read and 7.876MB/s write, which was about 50% slower than my Seagate USB 3.0 external drive in terms of read, but 10x faster in terms of write. That's overall pretty good, especially considering that random reads are the last thing you should use this for (i.e., running an OS)."," In a test copying 5GB of JPEGs onto this drive from a fast SSD, I found that it wrote at 48.6MB/s. That's not particularly fast, and I would have expected it to be faster based on its sequential write speed of 185MB/s.Also, this is very much an ""Apple""-style product, pushing tech forward at the expense of customers and existing standards. In its effort to be as streamlined as possible (i.e., include no bulky external power connector), Seagate has limited the Innov8 to USB 3.1 Type-C only, which means 99% of PC owners out there are not going to be able to use this drive today.Overall, you're paying a big premium for USB 3.1, and I'm just not convinced that it makes sense at this point to pay significantly more for a USB 3.1 drive than a USB 3.0 drive, given that USB 3.0 really isn't the bottleneck when using mechanical storage (my USB 3.0-powered external SSD runs circles around this device, for example). The only true advantage for this application is the lack of a power adapter, but that's not all that critical for desktop use."," While performing a test involving copying a large directory from one folder to another on this drive, the drive failed, leading to drive errors. While this is a scenario you likely won't be encountering much if you use this as a backup drive, it does make me wonder if the USB 3.1 drivers for my particular motherboard aren't quite ready. And given that Seagate has to depend on motherboard manufacturers to properly support USB 3.1 Type-C, it may be a while before this is the most reliable drive out there.",None,None

To review this item I purchased an inexpensive add on card. The drive had no problem working in windows 7 so the review that mentions that it is not compatible with windows 7 is incorrect. Through various tests of file transfers and benchmarking software i was able to get 350-400MB/s read speeds with 150-200MB/s write speeds. There were a couple slower test results but those could have been caused by many different things going on while running the tests. The drive was quiet and cool but rather heavy. It is not something that is portable., Physical size. It is heavy. I would be concerned about the amount of damage that this could cause if it were to accidentally slide off of your desk., I would argue that the target for this is someone who uses a laptop as their primary computer and wants additional storage space for that computer. In that case this drive is wonderful if it is planning on staying on the desk and not really traveling with you.,0,2
9SIA24G47M8352,22-178-940,9/2/2016 4:56:36 PM,John B.,"Large Storage, Large Device",3," * It’s big and beautiful, but sadly a little disappointing. When I unwrapped it, I was amazed by the quality of packaging and premium build design. No doubt, the Innov8 is a premium product. However, is the performance gain of USB 3.1 really worth it in Innov8’s case? *- Aesthetically, the Innov8 is an industrial-looking device due to the slotted aluminum enclosure. It has a granite black finish; appearing expensive, sleek, but alien simultaneously.Inside the box is a USB 3.1 cable (~18”), a quick start guide, and the device itself.  - I just have to mention the packaging and Seagate’s attention to detail concerning it. Molded soft foam lines the entire interior, the box itself is beautiful, and the presentation while opening it lets you know this is a premium product. - The Innov8 comes formatted as exFat and can be reformatted to NTFS. The application on the Innov8 setups up a program to be downloaded and installed, called Seagate Dashboard. It’s optional so you can choose to use it or not. But after following the web browser steps, Seagate offers you 200GB on OneDrive for 2 years for free. Definitely worth taking advantage of that free cloud storage. The software is pretty good. In my opinion it’s an even better backup program than WD Smartware. It’s flexible; you can have your entire PC be backed up to the drive continuously, monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly. The GUI is simple but effective. I think nearly anyone could set up an easy backup. Seagate’s DiskWizard from their website might also be helpful for setting the drive up in the manner you’d prefer. It’s essentially, though, all-in-all, a plug-N-play drive like most external drives nowadays. - The performance of the Innov8 beats practically every USB 3.0 drive I’ve tested and that is out on the market. However, is it really worth it? See “Cons” and “Other Thoughts.”- When in use, the drive gets tepid to the touch (max about 44 degrees C, min/idle about 31 degrees C), but it runs extremely quiet. It is much quieter than those vertical Desktop External HDDs in comparison.- Thanks to the miracle of USB 3.1 / C, this massive storage device doesn’t require a power adapter. It receives sufficient amount of power just through the USB 3.1 port. That’s a good sign for the future of USB 3.1 / C.- The Innov8 comes with a 3-year Limited Warranty according to Seagate, but taking a page from WD and offering a 5-Year would be much more reassuring."," - I’m not going to lie. The Innov8’s performance was pretty disappointing. Here, with this new amazing technology–with ceiling high transfer potential–the USB 3.1 on the Innov8 just didn’t blow me away. I was expecting extremely fast Read and Writes; I mean, why else put the money down on a USB C drive like this if it isn’t going to perform much better than comparable USB 3.0 drives? It’s certainly not a matter of convenience, considering most PCs don’t sport a USB 3.1 port. See Other Thoughts to look at my own specific benchmarks, but the Innov8 on average performed maybe 30 MB/s better than its 3.0 ancestor. It scored well with Peak R/W performance, but it wasn’t a consistent long-distance runner. Is it faster than USB 3.0? Yes. Does the hardware restriction of USB 3.1 and the hefty price make this mediocre increase in performance worth it? I personally don’t think so. - It may be an issue with all USB 3.1 cables but when plugged into the Innov8, the cable is not seated tightly. It wiggles like a loose tooth. And if I’ve learned anything from decades of using computers is if a port wiggles, it will eventually degrade. This is probably not the case with the Innov8 since you won’t be disconnecting or moving it around constantly, but I thought it worth nitpicking and mentioning. The same goes for the end connected to the PC. - The Innov8 is heavy (3.3lbs). Don’t mistake this thing as a “portable” drive. It’s definitely intended as a Desktop drive. The reason it’s heavy, though, is its construction and because of that it’s durable. I’d rather have it be lighter than look bad***, but still.- The Innov8 is huge, and I mean YUUUGE! You could easily stack four normal 4TB external portable drives in a square like fashion and the Innov8 will still be larger. Contrarily, the cable included, which is about 50cm, is a little short. For a desktop external drive, I’d expect at least a 3-foot long cable, especially since USB 3.1 cables aren’t the easiest and cheapest to get.- The drive reads under CrystalDiskInfo as a 5980RPM drive. Maybe I’m missing something or don’t have enough knowledge of what is exactly under the hood, but I imagine these drives should be 7200RPM to take full use of USB 3.1’s bandwidth. Its performance would have been much more impressive then. Possibly, Seagate should also offer a model with an external power supply, which could increase its performance slightly. I’m not sure if this is possible or not, but personally, I’d opt for a better performing one with an external power adapter.- The Innov8 as far as I know will only work on Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10. It has Mac support as well. No Windows 7 support is a disappointment but understandable considering the required USB 3.1."," - The Hard Drives inside of the Innov8 are Seagate’s Archive 8TB Sata III drives, with six SMR, 1.33TB platters, spinning at 5980RPM (as mentioned above), running under extremely low power requirements; hence the lack of an external power supply adapter.* Overall, I expected more from the Innov8. It’s a beautifully designed product, but its performance wasn’t as good as I expected. The 8TB in one package is a vast amount of storage; I just wish the USB 3.1 had performed better with the Innov8. Maybe we’ve got some more time before we can expect external drives to catch up with the potentiality of new technology. *-_- Below are Benchmarks I used to test the Innov8.

9SIA24G47M8352,22-178-940,8/26/2016 4:40:58 PM,Anonymous,"Expensive, not portable, but otherwise nice external hard drive",4," Appearance wise this thing looks great. Solid metal construction- it is very heavy when you first unbox it. Feels like a brick. Very big capacity- 8TB is more than what most people will ever need. Also, it is nice that a drive this big only requires one USB cable. Performance is what you would typically expect for a large size hard drive- very fast sequential read and write, but slower for random reads and writes (for example, lots of small files). This makes sense because the drive is slower spinning (5900 RPM) so it does take a while to get from one physical memory location to another.Comes with a 2 year offer for 200GB of storage on Microsoft OneDrive. Even after the 2 year period ends your data still is accessible, just read only so a great option to upload some older photos or other files that you won’t need to edit after the fact."," Yes it is an external hard drive but that doesn’t mean it’s actually very portable. I wouldn’t bring this around much- it’s pretty unwieldy. Also, the Ignition Boost Technology is basically just a battery that provides the extra little boost in power to get the drive started up (spinning it up takes more power than keeping it running) and if you turn it on and off a lot there’s a possibility that this battery doesn’t get a chance to recharge and gets depleted. Now, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing but considering it’s best for this to be just left on, there are a couple of other cons:First, the USB cable is pretty short. Not a problem if you’re just going to let the drive sit on the PC case, but my case is on the floor and I would rather have the drive on my desk, somewhere the cable won’t reach to. I could just buy another cable but quality cables are not the cheapest (USB is evolved enough that using cheap garbage cables can actually damage your stuff). Second, as other reviews have noted, the need for power means this is only compatible with USB C 3.1. Older USB ports simply don’t provide enough power, even USB 3.0. There are plenty of reports of people trying to use adapters and not having it work. I have a newer computer so no problem there, but really since this is not a portable drive, it would be best if I could use it as network storage, but I’d need a separate always on server type computer to do that. I don’t believe any routers currently have USB C 3.1 ports, as that is what I think would be the optimal way to use this drive."," All in all still a good product. However, in conclusion I think it’s more of a niche product. Since it isn’t really portable you would probably be better off just buying a big internal hard drive for your desktop and save a few bucks. Would work nicely for laptop users, but be sure you have a USB C 3.1 port, not an adapter.",None,None

IT DOES NOT WORK ON TYPE-A CONNECTION, OR ON USB 3.0, 2.0 or 1.1 The reason is that this drive needs more power than a Type-A connection can supply.Got it?

This takes you to a step-by-step guide online to obtain the 200GB of free storage. There are a few hoops to jump through, but it's pretty easy."," There is confusion in the description of the product. If you buy a Tesla they tell you up front - this is an electric car and it does NOT run on gasoline. Judging by the number of negative comments from some buyers of this Innov8 drive it would be desirable to state clearly that this drive is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH USB 3.0 PORTS.Instead of emphasizing that important information they shower us with buzzwords like ""Ignition Boost technology"" and remind us repeatedly that it's an engineering breakthrough! Actually, it's a Lithium battery that kick-starts the drive then allows the USB-C connection to take over from there. But, hey, for the high asking price we all want to brag to our friends that we got Ignition Boost technology, right? To be fair, the battery kick-start feature works, and it eliminates the need for an outboard power supply and that is not a con ...... unless you try to run the drive from a normal USB port!Premium price without a premium warranty. Seagate website clearly states the unit has a 3-year warranty. This would be fine for a mainstream product, but considering the claims made for the drive and, again, its high price, a 5-year warranty would surely be feasible."," The primary purpose of the Innov8 8TB drive is to store and serve up large quantities of data in a compact format, i.e. a single unit. It's not intended for frequently deleting and writing new data. Save your mountain of music, photos, videos, documents and projects onto the drive (be patient when doing this) then access the data whenever you want it. Incremental backups will work OK because you're only adding modest amounts of additional data. Shingle Magnetic Recording (SMR) is a useful innovation for archival recording. It achieves good Read and Write speeds on large contiguous files (think HD video). It's much slower on mixed and small files.ATTO Benchmark (Total size - 256MB) maxed out at Read - 195MB/s and Write - 184MB/s @ 1MB file size.HD Tune (Read only):Within 2MB/s the result was the same for 64K file size and for 1MB file size.Average - 186.5MB/sBurst - 134.4MB/sAccess Time - 15.3 msCrystalDiskMark version 4.0.3 x64:Seq.

The system has a single graphics card in the first X16 slot; the second X16 slot is empty, and a Dodocool USB 3.1 add-on controller card is installed in the third X16 slot. ""Auto"" sets the third X16 slot to run at X4 Link speed or maybe X8 Link speed since there's only one graphics card. Anyway, X4 is sufficient.With the add-on card firmly seated in place a SATA power cable was connected from the PC's power supply to the add-on card. This ensures the Type-C port can deliver a solid 5v / 3 amps.When booting up the display went dark and it hung for about 30 seconds before giving a brief error message and rebooting. This time it booted up OK. The add-on card appears in Device Manager as ""ASMedia USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 0110 (Microsoft)"" and just below that is ""ASMedia XHCI 1.0 Controller"". (These are in addition to the existing Intel USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 0100 Microsoft.)When the Innov8 was connected to the USB-C port on the card nothing happened. After wiggling the plug a connection was made and the drive became visible in Windows Explorer under ""This PC"". The available space is 7.27 TB (TiB to be precise). Connection remained reliable.Many people at home and those who run a small business have ever greater amounts of data that require long-term storage. I can recommend the Seagate Innov8 for that task.My only caveat is that in the past a couple of Seagate engineering innovation products have failed after 12 to 18 months. The most annoying was the Seagate Central 2TB Personal Cloud Storage. Although only lightly used, it died suddenly after 14 months. The design included a small circuit board sited next to the hard drive with no obvious ventilation. The circuit board bit the dust. We retrieved the hard drive but all data was corrupt. After formatting, the drive was again useable, if not entirely trustworthy. Such experiences inevitably make me wary of their newest products that hit the market. However, this Innov8 is built like a tank and seems very robust. Let's hope it remains so.",2,2

9SIA24G47M8352,22-178-940,8/20/2016 7:21:25 AM,Joshua R.,"Huge drive, both in capacity and in physical size",5," The Seagate Innov8 is built like a tank. The drive is encased in a heavy heat-sink. In my experience the reliability of external drives has been awful, every one that I've owned has died. I attribute this lack of reliability to heat. Unlike internal drives which are generally cooled by a fan, external drives are usually enclosed in an unventilated plastic case which traps the heat inside. Seagate has addressed this problem by enclosing the drive in a heavy aluminum heat-sink which should do a vastly superior job of cooling the drive. Obviously I can't say for sure what the long term reliability of this drive will be but I'm optimistic that it will be better than any external drive that I've used in the past.The interface is USB3.1 using the new USB-C connector. A short USB C cable is included in the package. If you have a Skylake generation computer then you probably have a USB-C connector, if not you will need to purchase a USB-A to USB-C cable. USB 3.1 is capable of 10GBit/sec which exceeds the requirement of any hard drive by a factor of 6, USB 3.0, found on most modern computers, is also adequate for this drive. The performance is decent for an external hard drive. I tested the drive using gnome-disks and sys_basher on a Skylake iCore7 system running Fedora 24. Sys_basher reporting read speeds up to 140 MBytes/sec and write speeds up 132MBytes/sec.

9SIA24G47M8352,22-178-940,8/18/2016 5:09:23 PM,William W.,The World's Largest External HDD,3," I reviewed Seagate’s new Innov8 USB 3.1 type C external hard drive. The main advantage of this drive is its copious 8TB of storage capacity. It’s also an external drive making this huge storage capacity portable. This is the first 3.5"" external hard drive of its size that can operate from a single USB-C port. No external power adapter is needed, or included. Unless you own a Mac with the latest Lightening port, the next fastest available data port is now the USB 3.1 type C, 2nd generation. This new USB standard supports data transfer rates up to 10Gb/Sec. Seagate also lists these additional advantages for the Innov8:+ 8TB USB-C powered external desktop storage solution+ Seagate Ignition Boost Technology+ All-aluminum enclosure+ NTFS driver for Mac+ Features the new reversible USB type C port (I added this one - very nice)Warranty:Limited Warranty period (parts): 5 years*Limited Warranty period (labor): 5 years**Note: NewEgg states 5-years, while Seagate’s website states only 3-years for the warranty?The Innov8 was packaged in an impressive display box with a top lid that included a closure flap that is held shut by two hidden magnets. The box is lined with a dense dark gray foam rubber to help cushion and protect the drive while its being transported. A rectangular shaped bottom cutout was big enough to hold the owners manual and the included 1Ft long USB 3.1 type C cable. There was also  another cutout at one end to make it easier to get your fingers underneath the drive to help lift it out the box. This drive is fairly heavy at 3.3Lbs. The drive case is made entirely out of aluminum, with grooves machined into it to act as heat sink fins for passive cooling. The case features nice rounded corners, a front mounted blue activity LED and an overall heavy duty industrial appearance. The enterprise grade SMR HDD used inside the Innov8 is reported to use six 1.33TB platters. The Innov8 was very quiet while operating and only became slightly warm while in use.The Innov8 external drive was simple to install. Just make sure you have the requisite USB 3.1 type C port available on your host computer. See the Cons section below for further details on that matter. The Innov8 provided 7.27TB of available disk space. The Innov8 ships preformatted with the ExFAT file system. It also had an “autorun” file that was designed to launch your default browser and take you directly to Seagate’s website. Once at the website the new drive owner is prompted to register the drive and to download a free copy of the Seagate Dashboard backup software.Here are the Crystal Diskmark results:Sequential Read (Q=32,T=1):        38.274 MB/sSequential Write (Q=32,T=1):       36.624 MB/sRandom Read 4KiB (Q=32,T=1):    0.663 MB/s [ 161.9 IOPS]Random Write 4KiB (Q=32,T=1):   7.011 MB/s [1711.7 IOPS]Sequential Read (T=1):                  41.732 MB/sSequential Write (T=1):                 38.592 MB/sRandom Read 4KiB (Q=1,T=1):    0.629 MB/s [ 153.6 IOPS]Random Write 4KiB (Q=1,T=1):   6.530 MB/s [1594.2 IOPS]Note the slow random read/write 4KiB results. This is probably due to the SMR recording method used to multi-layer the data on to the platters, combined with a lot of head seeks, a low RPM platter speed and a lack of NCQ support.I next deleted the ExFAT partition and reformatted the drive to the NTFS file system and repeated the same tests. See the new results below:Sequential Read (Q=32,T=1):         39.797 MB/sSequential Write (Q=32,T=1):       37.564 MB/sRandom Read 4KiB (Q=32,T=1):    0.656 MB/s [ 160.2 IOPS]Random Write 4KiB (Q=32,T=1):   7.009 MB/s [1711.2 IOPS]Sequential Read (T=1):                 41.523 MB/sSequential Write (T=1):                38.591 MB/sRandom Read 4KiB (Q=1,T=1):     0.615 MB/s [ 150.1 IOPS]Random Write 4KiB (Q=1,T=1):    6.958 MB/s [1698.7 IOPS]Surprisingly there was little performance difference between the ExFAT and the NTFS file systems on this drive. After reformatting the drive to NTFS, the Seagate Dashboard utility could no longer recognize the drive on my system, rendering it useless. The free Macrium Reflect 6.x backup had no issues locating the new drive. I used it instead to backup my two SSD drives to the Innov8. During the backup tests, transfer rates averaged a modest 250Mb to 292Mb/Sec, and took 32:48 to backup my C: drive with 69GB and over four hours to backup a data drive with 510GB of compressed backup data.I read that the Seagate Ignition Boost Technology uses an internal battery to help boost the normal 5VDC USB power supply up to the 12VDC needed to kick-start the 3.5"" drive’s 12VDC platter motor. Once up to speed the battery is no longer needed. So you should probably avoid powering this drive on and off too frequently, or you may end up draining its battery similar to a car."," The main con is the Innov8's limited connectivity due to having only one data port (USB 3.1 type-C) on its drive enclosure. While it might be fashionable to only offer a single port, it would have been more practical if Seagate had also included a standard round 5VDC power supply connector for those situations where only a USB-type-A, (lower power USB 2.0, or 3.0 host port) is available. They could then offer an optional AC wall adapter to allow the Innov8 to be used with older hardware. A USB 3.0 type B port would have also been handy for attaching the Innov8 to present-day laptop and desktop computers. Using this type of port would again require an external power supply to power the Innov8. What would have been even more innovative in my humble opinion would have been for Seagate to offer a much smaller enclosure with two of their 2.5"" - 4TB laptop drives stacked inside, using JBOD technology. That setup could probably be powered from a standard USB 3.0 host port, or using a dual USB-A plug hookup.I am also surprised that this external drive does not offer any WIFI support? What about an Ethernet port so it could be placed on a network? This would be a great use for a drive this large.To get around the need for a USB 3.1 type C port, I thought about buying a USB-A to type-C adapter cable, however Seagate’s Innov8 website states: “Using a USB-C-to-USB-A cable adapter will not damage the Innov8 product or computer, but using such an adapter is not supported.” Although the Innov8 should be backwards compatible with slower bandwidth USB connections, I suspect the power requirements of the Innov8 are the main issue here. My next thought was what about buying an active USB hub, with its own external power supply, but again Seagate’s website had this to say: “Can the Innov8 function while connected to a USB hub, dock, or dongle? Individual results may vary, but connecting the Innov8 to this kind of equipment is not supported.” What a bummer Seagate! I think it would be worth Seagate’s time and effort to do some lab testing and then recommend some alternative USB cables or hubs that will work reliably with the Innov8. This would make it more useful.You will quickly find that the more commonly available USB 2.0, or 3.0 rectangular shaped “A” ports as seen on most computers, simply can’t supply enough power for the Innov8 to operate reliably. Even though USB 3.1 type C is expected to be adopted into the market fairly quickly, it will be years until today’s current crop of desktops, laptops and tablets are replaced with newer models capable of handling the new USB standard’s 5V/3A current needs. By that time 8TB or larger external hard drives should be pretty commonplace. I would also expect this 3.5"" drive with its heavier power needs to more quickly drain the battery on any laptop or tablet device that is not kept connected to an AC power source. That leaves the only current realistic market for these drives to be either desktop computers or small servers that can handle the higher USB power demands.Its fairly large and its heavy, this limits the Innov8's portability and overall utility. On the plus side you won’t have to worry about the Innov8 accidentally sliding off a smooth desktop.The supplied one foot long USB 3.1 type C male to type C male cable was way too short to be used for anything but laptops. A 3Ft/1M long cable would have made a lot more sense. From what I have read there are only two laptop models currently on the market capable of supporting the Innov8, an Apple Macbook series and a Google Chromebook series. That is not a lot of laptop choices. As newer laptop models are introduced this Fall, the USB 3.1 type C interface should become more commonplace. Most mid to high-end desktops should be upgradable with a PCI-E expansion card like the one I used for my testing. (See Other Thoughts below)."," When offered the opportunity to test the Innov8, the first thing I asked myself was what can I plug the Innov8 into? Since the drive was already on its way, I immediately ordered an IOGear model GIC3C2 PCI-Express, USB 3.1 type-C expansion card for my main desktop PC. The IOGear PCI-E card I ordered has two USB 3.1 type-C, with reversible connectors on its back plate. They are rated to support up to 10Gb/sec and can supply the 5V/3A power needed by the Innov8. A PCB mounted female SATA power socket on the IOGear expansion card needs to be connected to a spare SATA power cable inside the desktop PC. This avoids drawing too much power from the PCI-E expansion bus and possibly damaging the motherboard. The IOGear USB 3.1 type C expansion card installed and performed flawlessly. Highly recommended. Search NewEgg for it.I encountered a strange issue with the Windows 7 File Explorer. I wanted to assign the drive a new drive label called “Innov8"", versus the Windows default “Local Disk” label. After I hit “Apply” nothing happened. I repeated the command, still no go. So I viewed the drive using the Windows Disk Manager and the correct drive label was displayed. The “Safely Remove” icon also displayed the correct drive label. One forum site I visited recommended to unmount the drive and then try remounting it, this did not work. I next tried rebooting my system, again no go. I have seen this Windows bug before with flash drives that use the ExFAT file system, so after running the Crystal Disk benchmarks I decided to quick format the Innov8 using the NTFS file system. This solved the labeling issue in File Explorer.Seagate’s website offered little to no information on the particular desktop drive that was installed inside the Innov8's case. I suspect based on the leisurely transfer rates that it must be a slower 5,400, or 5,900 RPM, SMR archival hard drive. The five-year warranty, if that is accurate, indicates it may also be an enterprise grade drive. The new USB-C standard still does not support AHCI (Advanced Host Controller Interface) mode, nor NCQ (Native Command Queuing). NCQ helps to speedup random reads/writes by allowing the controller to reorganize the data to minimize the amount of head movement required by the HDD. This is probably why the Innov8 did so poorly on the 4K random reads/writes tests in the Crystal Diskmark. While the general trend in computing has always been toward smaller, lighter and faster devices, the Innov8 drive is kind of an anachronism. It utilizes a larger, heavier 3.5"" HDD mounted inside a heavy, metal case, while offering limited connectivity. The 10 Gb/Sec, USB 3.1 type C interface seems wasted considering the slow HDD installed inside the Innov8. A USB 3.0 interface should have been plenty fast without the limited connectivity issues of the USB 3.1 type C interface. There is also the concern of putting all of your eggs into one big basket. Could you afford to lose 8TB of data should this drive ever fail? How would you backup the data stored on an Innov8? In its favor the Innov8 external drive has won a design award and it offers a large amount of storage capacity at an increasingly affordable price point. I would recommend that potential buyers hold off purchasing this drive and instead wait and see what the competition comes up with, then make your final purchase decision.Assigning an Egg rating for this drive was somewhat difficult. Basically you have one of the world’s first and largest external hard drives, yet offering only limited connectivity and limited portability, inside a nice looking, yet heavy case, and with poor data transfer rates. You may also need to purchase a longer cable and a laptop style case to store this drive in, if you plan to take it with you on the road. I don’t see too many people wanting to go to all of that bother. I was also disappointed by the drive’s overall performance. So the Innov8's mostly likely usage scenario is either permanently resting on a desktop, or connected to a backroom router or mini-server acting as mass storage device. Given its slow read/write speeds, limited utility and lack of redundancy, I can only award it three eggs.",1,2

They asked me to hang on as they passed it up the chain. They did not have videos but advised that they existed elsewhere and on top of that and allowed me to open the case (carefully) and see if I could salvage my photos. When I was done I was given permission to return the drive and they would replace it under warranty even though there was no fault on Seagate's part. As it turned out, the drive was ok once I managed to free it from its plastic bonds. Plugged it into an available SATA port and the computer found it and installed it properly.

I consistently get data transfer rates of 180 MB/s when writing from my PC's SSD to this over the USB 3.0 port.  Two very minor cons.  First, this goes into a sleep mode after a fairly short (less than 10 minutes, I haven't timed it exactly).  Some might like that, but I find the start up pause annoying--and wish I could either turn it off, or put the idle mode on a longer delay... like 30 minutes or an hour.Second, I see this is selling for around $106, but the 5 TB version (STEB5000100) is selling for $129.

Just plugged it into my tower (EVGA Dark X79 platform) and formatted just to be safe and was ready in little time.The drive does have a bright blue LED on the front so it's easy to know it's powered on and working.  Transfers are fantastic as is to be expected from USB 3.  I'm using the drive primarily for photo and video backup and seeing transfer rates between 70-100MB/sec with bursts far higher.  Seems to be right in line with what the USB dongle to the board puts out.Lots of storage space.  Fast transfers.  So far, so good for stability, super easy to use, and no issues at all with a Windows 7 Pro x64 desktop."," So far, it's been stable and fast.Comes with a shockingly short 1 year warranty.  Really?!  What happened when drives gave 5 or 10 year warranties?Otherwise my quips are minor.  The drive is a bit bulkier than other slim external HDDs and because this is a full sized desktop drive inside, it draws more power than USB supplies so it requires an oddly shaped AC adapter."," While there are some minor reservations as I said, I have been pleasantly surprised by this drive so far and for the price, it seems to be a good deal.  3TB is fantastic for backups and storing tons of data - presuming the drive retains quality to last as long as I hope it would.

The case is very pleasing to the eyes and looks great sitting on the desk. It has a very professional looking design. The drive itself is huge and can hold hundreds of thousands of mp3 music files, hundreds of HD movie files, and other data galore.  It also makes a perfect system backup device using the backup program in Windows or another program like Acronis backup, which I tried and had complete success.The speed of the drive is quite fast using the USB3 connection.  I attached this drive to a MSI x79 motherboard, running Windows 8.1 Pro, and achieved over 150MB/s read and write speeds using Crystal Diskmark.I attached this to my Mac and reformatted it as an Extended Mac OS and turned on Time Machine, and all went very smooth. So, depending on your system hardware and OS that you use there are several capabilities at hand using the Seagate Expansion drive.", I have found no real cons or disadvantages using this drive.," The package is loaded with a large, fast, quiet, quality built 3TB drive and case.  Everything you need is included to plug and play after unboxing.  If you need extra storage space, and who doesn't, this is a great drive to consider.",1,1
N82E16822178740,22-178-740,5/7/2015 12:18:21 AM,Doug O.,Insomnia?,4," Pleasantly fast compared to my USB2 drives. Competitively priced. Plug-and-play – already formatted, requires no software installation. If all goes well, you plug it in, it shows up in your list of drives, ready to use. Comes with a substantial in-line power supply. Some might consider this a con, but what this drive lacks in compact portability it probably makes up for in sturdiness. It's a full-size drive with a full-size power supply.I didn't attempt a formal speed test because this drive would no doubt outperform the other components of my laptop. But I did just transfer a 103 gig file between the Seagate and another USB 3 drive in about 25 minutes, which I'm happy with. I'm sure that under optimum conditions the drive would perform faster."," My only complaint involves the drive's interaction with the Windows 7 OS. Windows often fails to recognize the drive's presence, and also often fails to put the drive to sleep. This may, however, be the fault of the Anker USB hub I'm running it through, so I'm not sure if this merits knocking off an egg. Perhaps other reviewers will share their experience. In my experience, I sometimes need to unplug and re-plug the drive before Windows sees it. Other times I need to unplug and re-plug the entire hub before it's recognized. The ""insomnia"" is pretty consistent – even when I put the entire computer to sleep, the drive keeps humming. And since the drive has no cooling fan, and does get warm, this is really not good. If someone just left this plugged in, I wouldn't place bets on long life expectancy – a definite con. Again, this could be the fault of the hub, but it's worth noting that my Samsung drive exhibits neither of these problems, using the same hub.",,3,4

No fans and no garishly bright LED's. Attractive, minimal case design. Will only power on when the USB3 cable is connected, which is a cool power saving feature."," Minimally-ventillated plastic enclosure runs a little warm and has no standoffs to allow for stacking multiple drives. No S.M.A.R.T. status. The included documentation makes no mention of the aforementioned cool power saving feature of the drive only powering up when connected, so make sure you actually connect it before you assume your drive is DOA."," I should preface this review by saying that though I am a ravenous consumer of hard drives, this drive is actually the first USB3 drive I have owned, and the interface standard absolutely lives up to the hype. I get sustained write rates (copying file backups in the form of DMG sparse bundles) in excess of 100mb/s on my Mac Pro, substantially quicker than I ever saw with eSATA. The connector is robust and easy to deal with, also unlike eSATA. Of course, that speaks more to USB3 standard than to this drive, so to turn our attention there: overall, this seems to be a really nice consumer-grade external drive package. The drive enclosure is a very simple, glossy back plastic affair. The drive is cooled passively, meaning no fans, which is great for minimizing noise, not so great if you really hammer on the drives. I tried copying a full 2tb of data to the drive and found that it did get a little hot, but no worse than I have seen with other fanless plastic enclosures. I would definitely caution anyone about stacking these drives on top of each other or placing them vertically right against one another, however-- the only provided ventilation is on the top of the drive, and there are no standoffs to prevent you from blocking these vents entirely. The enclosure is fairly minimal and attractive, and is not garnished with any awful blaring-bright LED's. The ""adaptable positioning"" is a little silly of Buffalo's marking folks to boast about, but yes, you can definitely orient it two different ways without the need for a stand. Acoustic properties are excellent, the drive is very quiet in all modes of operation.The drive arrives formatted NTFS, but does mount on a Mac right out of the box, and once reformatted works flawlessly with Mac OS (10.9.2). Curiously, the drive does not seem to support SMART-- first time I have seen that in a while, but not really a deal-breaker for an external. The included power supply is generic, and there is no indication as to who makes the drive inside the enclosure. Overall, this drive seems to be a nice, if no-frills, choice for someone seeking a high-speed, low-cost backup solution. In comparison to other external hard drives I have used, I think the most substantial drawback here is the minimal provision for cooling. Those who envision using this drive for long-term sustained data transfer might do better to seek a drive with more robust cooling provisions, but for general storage use this offers an attractive option.",17,17
9SIA0AJ3G66973,22-165-569,3/2/2014 4:00:13 PM,Brian S.,Excellent Backup drive,4," Overall very fast drive. Performance was on the high end of what's possible in an external enclosure right now. Really impressive considering the internal drive is only 5400rpm. Buffalo's technology makes it so you get the energy savings from a slower rotation speed without having to sacrifice performance through intelligent use of the integrated cache and associated firmware adjustments.Performance specs:Read: Min spd: 94MB/s. Max: 193MB/s. Average: 160MB/s.Access time of 16.8ms.Burst rate is 216MB/s.Subjectively I got read rates around 150MB/s. Write speeds averaged around 46MB/s. Much slower, but to be expected. Writing to a drive is always slower than reading from it.This drive couldn't be any easier to use, it's fast and it's priced right. Solid buy!"," Tried to download their software to test it, download failed with no error messages.They should probably include their software on a CD in the package.Warranty is only 1 year. 5 is pretty standard but 3 is the industry standard for a consumer drive. One egg taken away for the short warranty period."," Buffalo is a growing name in the consumer storage space. Their NAS (Network attached storage) offerings have been competitive for quite some time. They offer a good value of performance and price. While they leave room for improvement in customer service and support they are quickly becoming one of the major players in the consumer storage space.  They need to invest more in customer support and put longer warranties on their products. If they had a minimum warranty of 3 years on all their storage devices, NAS and local, then they'd be a real contender. Assuming, of course, that they also had to support structure to make that warranty actually useful to customers.",10,10
9SIA0AJ3G66973,22-165-569,2/28/2014 9:07:53 PM,Steven H.,You can't go wrong with this one!,5," The first thing you notice about this drive is the shiny piano black case with the flat black top and bottom. It is very unobtrusive and will look good with any system.  Plugging in the USB and power cords and booting revealed another pleasant surprise.  I could not hear it at all. If it were not for the small LED on the front, I would not know that it was running. It quickly showed up on my monitor. After testing the drive for errors and durability, I ran a few speed tests.  While it is no speed demon, it is no slouch either, with speeds about average of what you would expect for drives in this category and price point.   The software is a nice touch.  I like small simple programs that do one thing, rather than catch all programs that do much more than you want or need.  The  software of course only works with Buffalo drives, I haven't fully evaluated the software, but I can tell you that the backup software is simple to use and seems to work well."," This is a minor, picky comment, but, because the case is flat black on the bottom and top.  I had to look closely tell which was which.  It would be nice if the Buffalo name on the top were a bit more prominent, maybe Buffalo red.    I wouldn't want to use any mechanical drive upside down."," Buffalo does not manufacture hard drives, They manufacture devices that use hard drives.  I have seen drives from different manufacturers used in Buffalo products. They were all quality drives from respectable sources.  I have seen this model advertised as a 5400 rpm drive.  The specs on the drive I am evaluating is 7200 rpm.  Regardless,  this drive does exactly what it was designed for and does it well.  If you don't have a backup system or it's time to upgrade, you won't go wrong with this one.",1,1
9SIA0AJ3G66973,22-165-569,2/28/2014 11:26:57 AM,Lee J.,Stealthy external storage,5," The Buffalo Drivestation is nearly silent in operation, I had to check the little green LED to make sure it was really on or off. It’s also fast- I averaged about 100 MB/s while loading this thing up with ripped movies. Given the USB 3 interface, I expected it to be fast, but it’s the details that make this an outstanding external drive. There is no on-off switch, instead the drive automatically shuts off when the PC is asleep or off. It does not emit too much heat, which is a good sign when considering longevity. A three foot USB3 cable is rightfully included, and the drive can be arranged horizontally or vertically. The Backup Utility software (for Windows) is not exactly industrial strength but it’s at least as useful as the Mac OS’s Time Machine. It allows you to set a backup schedule and run backups on designated drives or directories. Simple and effective.", It’s expensive. Seagate offers a similar product for a good $20 less at the time of this review.," I assume Buffalo’s intent is to appeal to users who want speed and silence and are willing to pay a little more for it. With that in mind, this drive is a real winner. Quiet, fast, unobtrusive… It’s easy to forget this thing is external. I hardly notice its presence. The software, other than the backup utility, is forgettable and I doubt most users will bother with it. Overall, this drive gets a big recommendation from me.",1,1
9SIA0AJ3G66973,22-165-569,2/26/2014 3:05:27 PM,David K.,Blazing Fast External!,5," This is the most impressive 3.0 external device I’ve ever seen.  I was amazed to see that this was a 5400 RPM drive.  The USB 3.0 connection, and possibly some technology thrown in by Buffalo,  makes this drive operate just as fast as any internal 3 ½ inch hard drive.  It took less than 14 minutes to create a total system image in Windows 8.1, using Windows internal imaging utility.  I am using 55GB of allocated space on my drive, which is a 120GB SSD.Installation a no brainer.  Just plug the regular 3 foot USB cable into an unused USB port (hopefully 3.0) on your computer and it show up just like another internal hard drive.  It works in any operating system, per the instructions that came with the drive, but it is preformatted NTFS.I’ve plugged this drive into the back of my system and cannot hear it.  The drive itself is a handsome black plastic box just big enough to hold the 3 ½ inch hard drive.  Fit and finish looked very good.  It can be place on its side of flat, and airflow will not be restricted."," The unit needs its own power – a wall wart of course.  This enables the drive to deliver outstanding performance.  Buffalo purported to furnish disk formatting and backup software.  I passed on both.  I was not able to download the imaging software, but I did not try more than a few minutes."," Buffalo Technology technical support is decent but timeconsuming.  I fortunately did not use them for this item.This drive will seem huge compared to the 2 ½ inch external drives that are the size of a deck of cards.  So if portability is important, you would be better off sticking with a smaller 2 ½ inch, which is slower but does not require its own power.",1,1

9SIA0AJ3G66973,22-165-569,2/16/2014 1:39:40 PM,Jason C.,"Very nice, but not perfect.",4," The first thing I noticed is how quiet this thing is. I hadn't even realized it was on. This is saying something given that my entire desktop is about 20 decibels. The speed I can't really give negative points for (roughly 25mb/sustained write) as I'm still on usb 2.0. I'm currently backing up my entire 640 Gb windows 7 os drive. The l.e.d. that's used on this thing is not very bright. It's just bright enough to let you know what's going on but not too bright as to light up a dark room like some devices. It also lets you know when data is transferring by fading in and out slowly. This is a nice touch to let you know when the drive is doing any transferring of data. It goes into a low power mode but the second you need it and pull it up into explorer, it's ready to go. The look of the drive is nice and for a 3.5'' internal drive, the footprint is quite small. I especially like the attention to detail regarding the vents. This allows you to store it flat or on it's side vertically. For me I chose flat as space wasn't an issue, but it's certainly nice to have options.The usb cable is roughly 3 feet and really is the perfect length to plug in without having crazy excess. A really cool feature with this drive is that buffalo intelligently put a link to it's download page for the software already on the drive when you pull it up in explorer. This allows instant access to the software available for the device without having to go through some menus on the website. It's a small thing but the attention to detail on this drive is impressive. The software is as follows:  Secure lock mobile: Says boot failure (I assume because i'm backup up my os to the drive atm)Turbo pc ex: designed to boost the connection/read/write speeds from your pc to your drive and vice versa. Not sure that it works on usb2.0 given my 25mb/sec sustained write speed.eco manager- allows you to turn on and off the power savings of the drive. Last time I tried this, it failed but previous times it worked just fine (again, i'm backing up my os)disk formatter 2: A simple utility to format the drive into either fat32, ntfs or just plain erase the drive. If you want more than this from a formatting tool, I suggest other software. It comes formatted in ntfs, btw.Finally backup utility. This allows you to schedule a backup on a specific schedule by time itself or hours. If you backup your os drive please keep in mind it cannot backup in-use files. The best full backup utilities work on a boot cd because there are no files in use during pc boot up. This allows EVERY file to be backed up like a mirror image. This software, doesn't do that.", The software is half-baked. I prefer more features in the software. It should all be in one program instead of 4 different downloads. I get the minimalist approach here but one program to download is far easier for the end user and you could always turn off individual features you don't use.," Obviously, long term reliability is an unknown here so keep that in mind. The hardware and fit and finish of the device and the small attention to detail regarding that hardware, is impeccable. The software is in desperate need of the same innovation the hardware engineers seem to have in spades. If your looking for a quiet, backup drive that looks good on your desk, has automatic power saving technology, and barely makes a sound when in use and the software doesn't matter, this is the drive for you. If however your looking for an all-encompassing backup solution with built-in robust software, you may want to look elsewhere.",2,2
9SIA0AJ3G66973,22-165-569,2/8/2014 7:06:34 PM,Michael B.,Best external drive yet,5," Quiet, cool, fast!!   Technology marches on!Has cooling vents on four sides so you can place it flat or vertically on your desk.  Even during a long backup it barely gets warm to the touch.  You can feel a little vibration through the case, but the noise is inaudible over the sound of my computer fans.  Comes with a 40 inch (1 meter) USB cable and a small power supply with a 56 inch cable.  Nice lengths for most users, I'd say.  There is a small green power LED that also dims and brightens to indicate disk access.I let Windows 7 run a full check on this disk before I used it.  It took about 3 hours.  No bad sectors reported.I can see this drive being ideal for say, a photographer who runs Lighroom/Photoshop/Aperture on their laptop and wants to have a fast external drive to hold his/her image database.  It comes with software that uses some of the computer RAM as a cache to speed up drive access, which would be ideal when editing photos.  There is also a backup utility, a power manager that powers down the drive after a chosen time, an encryption program and a disk formatter.I chose not to install any of the software, but if you get one of these drives, I suggest you check out the software and see what might meet your needs.It came in a rather large retail box that should stand up to shipping pretty well."," If you need a compact portable drive, the 3.5 inch form factor may not be convenient for you.  Not really a con, but there is no way to really quantify how much abuse any hard drive will take.  I always treat them with care."," I've gone through several external USB drives over the last few years because I'm the principal photographer for BeyondBoudoirPhoto and I have to make multiple backups of my hard drives that store images for clients.  The 2 TB size works best for my Lightroom catalog and I have several drives in this size.  Up until now I've not been impressed with the performance of USB drives, even the USB 3 drives have been slow compared to internal SATA drives and the USB 3 circuitry sometimes has issues.  The last 3.5 inch external drive I bought was so bad that I broke it out of its USB 3 housing and used it as an internal drive!  It still wasn't fast, but at least it worked then.One reason these drives tend to be slow is that they use low-speed motors to reduce energy consumption and heat.  This new drive from the Buffalo folks uses a 5400 RPM drive inside, so I was not expecting much.  Imagine my surprise when it outperformed my recently purchased 7200 RPM SATA3 internal drives!  I use a backup program called Casper to do incremental backups and it gives me a speed number in the backup report.  Here are three examples I noted today:2.5 inch 2 TB USB 3 passport drive:  117 MB/sec3.5 inch 2 TB SATA 3 internal drive:  181 MB/sec3.5 inch 2TB USB 3 Buffalo drive:      203 MB/secI really don't know how they made this drive that fast, but I'm not going to complain!",2,2
N82E16822178951,22-178-951,2/1/2017 12:16:17 AM,William H.,"OK drive for normal reads/writes, slow and hot for large backups",3, SizeLooks niceCame with nice cable, Flimsy plastic shellSlow on large backups and formatting.  (basically anytime it runs a long time)," I've had a lot of good solid performance out of the Western Digital external (and internal for that matter) drives over the years.  I must have owned two dozen MyBooks and Passports and not had an issue.  So I went to a big box store near me looking for an 8TB WD Mybook to go along side a 6TB Mybook that is too small now for my backups.  I'm backing up a NAS server to these to send out as an off-site backup.Unfortunately the big box store didn't have the WD drives and the guy there talked me into this drive.  I figured it was 6 one way and half dozen another so I went ahead and got this drive.  I sort of wish I would have just came home and ordered from Newegg.  Here is what I've found.I've run the drive solid for probably two weeks no problems.  I like the look of it and the blue light on top is something I don't have a problem with, like some reviewers did.  The drive is on a shelf behind me, slightly below eye level so I can turn around and see the light if I need to.  I can see it might be an issue if it were up higher.  I think the drive looks nice and it makes no noise as far as I can tell.  At least I can't hear it sitting right next to a 5 disk array NAS.Now this may not be an apples to apples comparison so I will just put it out there as my experience but here goes.  As far as formatting or backing multiple TB to the drive it is very slow compared to my 6TB WD.  On a 4.5TB backup it averaged 23 MB/s and took 2 days 9 hours, or 1.8 TB per day, or, put another way, 4.23 days to back 8TB.  It was about the same speed formatting the drive, which wasn't necessary but something I decided to do once I saw how slow it was on the first backup.  I tried different cluster sizes but that didn't make any difference.My WD 6 TB drive averages about 83 MB/s and will do multi-terabyte backups at 7.3 TB per day, or 3.8 times faster.I wish I could attach an image but if you look at the graph of MB/s write speed during these long backups the Seagate will burst for a while at a reasonable, say 50 MB/s rate, and then drop off to 2 MB/s or less for long periods of time.  I think it must have some sort of heat limiting circuit or something that just slows it down to a crawl.  Then it will eventually burst for a while longer.  I can assure you the server was doing nothing during these days.Having said all that, once your done with your large backups the incremental backups or normal file copies will be just fine.  I copied 11 GB to it a 90 MB/s (about 2 minutes) a couple of hours after the main backup had finished.  And, it's not like it hurts anything to let the drive run for days, as far as I know.If your doing regular stuff with it then you will probably be very happy with this drive.  For me, I really feel like I should have stuck to my original plan of going with the MyBook 8TB.  There is a lot to like about the drive but I think I would have liked the MyBook just as well and gotten faster speed and a more rugged case.  Then again, I haven't used the 8TB MyBook so I could be wrong.  I do like the case better on the MyBooks for moving back and forth as an off-site backup.  I'm a little worried about this one and feel like I now need to go by a hard shell padded box of some kind to move it around in.  Would that count towards the TB/$ ratio?",3,4

The drive also comes with a USB cable and it has a small footprint on my desk.  In other words, it is a small drive that comes with the hardware you need to install it, reads/writes fast enough, and stores lots and lots of data.  On the surface a great drive, please see cons for the whole story."," The drive has two big cons.First, it makes very loud clunking noises and the clunking creates vibration.  In fact, the clunking creates vibrations so strong that they make my keyboard keys vibrate.  My keyboard is located about 18 inches from the drive.  I am using the drive with Plex Media Server to stream my video collection to my TV.  The drive clunks continuously through each video file that Plex is streaming.Secondly, the drive makes so much noise and vibration that I am worried about how long the drive is going to last.  When you combine that worry with only a 1 year warranty you can understand my concern.  I do not trust this drive to last very long.", I would not recommend this drive to others.  I give it 3 stars because so far it is working.I do not trust this drive to be a secure backup device.  I am going to have to buy another 8TB drive from a different manufacturer soon in order to backup this drive so I can be confident that I am not going to lose my data.,1,2

I have used the older designed expansion cases of 5TB and they were MUCH better. The new case itself is just plastic with holes on TWO sides (older case had a aluminium sheet around the drive which acted a  heat sink with holes at bottom as well which worked great to keep them cool). When copying 3.5TB the drive died due to heat which was above 50C (I placed in a zip lock bag and put it in Freezer and it revived). Even when working I was getting randomn speed spikes after 2-3 minutes of copying which is very odd. I had two drives and both showed the same symptom. I finally copied 3.5TB to one drive but it just died with a week. In panic, I opened it up (void warranty but I needed my data back as I had deleted my old drive data) and placed it into Freezer again and it started up again and managed to recover in 2 days! slow copying speed for reading but it was the erratic at best. I am now using one as a internal drive (only fot backup after 1 week) and one as a backup to a NAS (in case but with a small fan on it when I was making the first backup as this heats up fast). Please spend some money and buy a good NAS or Desktop drive . This Archive drives were good before (my 5TB one is still going awesome) but the 8TB one is just a bad drive which will kill your data and with 8TB it will make you be sorry for trying to save $40.",1,2

Passive cooling vents on the bottom and rear do not keep the drive cool under continuous usage (nor are they really meant to).," It may be obvious to some, but these drives are NOT designed for continuous writes and rewrites.  When they are brand new, you can easily get over 100MB/s write speeds, but after they've been written to a few times, that number drops to 20MB/s or even lower.  At that speed, it will take FIVE DAYS to fill up 8TB.  And I wouldn't recommend writing to one of these continuously for five days either without some sort of active cooling solution.  I wrote to this drive for almost a day and it was more than warm to the touch after that ordeal.These drives are designed with SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording) technology.  Basically, SMR lets you pack even more data on a disk, but it sacrifices write speed tremendously.  Google the storage review of this drive to learn more before you buy.Since the write speeds are so low, you can just use a USB2.0 port while writing data to it to free up USB3.0 ports for other things.",8,10

Kinda slow on re-writes.," I previously reviewed the 8TB Seagate Backup Plus drives. I am happy to say there have been NO failures of the 21 drives in 9 months. I recently needed to upgrade my 'Movie' computer and bought 6 more drives. While I did not encounter any failures, I was disappointed. I didn't notice that Seagate markets the external 8TB drives two ways, the Backup Plus and the Expansion packages. I'll focus on the differences noting that the actual drives are IDENTICAL. However, the warranty on the Expansion drive is only 1 year while the Backup Plus is 2 years. If you want to remove the drive from the enclosure and reuse the enclosure, say for the drive being replaced, the Backup Plus is MUCH more friendly to disassemble and reuse (as-is or just using the frame sitting on a desk to temporarily connect a drive to a computer). The Expansion enclosure will be nearly destroyed and the SATA3 to USB3 adapter is taped to the drive as there is no frame. Also, the Backup Plus packages came with 2 year, 200GB One Drive Cloud storage, for those who use the Cloud.",6,7

Seagate should be tucking their tail between their legs when they issued it. The bigger problem is that I purchased 2 identical drives for a NAS archive.

How would Seagate manage is authorized warranty and who isn't?I looked it up and both my units warranty expire Dec 17 (which is a little more than a year). I have no idea what to make of that and have to wonder if these drives are counterfeit.. Will I be supported if one of the drives fail?

It’s a hard disk drive, an item not well known for it’s tolerance for shock and impact. The packaging reflects this.Clean elegant aesthetics. The enclosure has a very nice look to it and doesn’t use that awful high gloss plastic that’s only marketable use is for collecting greasy fingerprints. The single LED DOES look nice, and fits with the uncluttered look of the enclosure, but it’s positiong is problematic (see Cons).Plug and play. Pretty self explanatory. The quick set up guide lists two steps: 1. Attach power cable, 2. Attach data cable. Up and running in about 30 seconds.No gimmicky applications included, just a preconfigured external hard drive."," Indication LED is top mounted, rather than the standard front mount. Why even put an LED on it if it’s just going to dictate where you’re able to place the drive in order to be able to see it?Housing feels like it’s made of very cheap plastic. Very rarely do I receive items for review that I have to give negative marks on quality, at worst, it’s a split, but this whole drive’s housing is made of some very flimsy plastic. I seriously think one major impact to the housing would shatter it. I own another Seagate external drive which is made of much much sturdier plastic,  it is a year older than this one however.Only has rubber feet to support it being stood up vertically. Maybe they want to discourage people stacking stuff on it? I don’t know, but depending on where you maybe forced to place the drive, it would be highly advantageous to not force you into one positioning option.Running the included setup application fails to take you to the Seagate product registration page (which is where I suspect it’s attempting to take you based on the URL). Fairly easily worked around, but why do I need to do that?1 year warranty is a joke. I started buying hard drives back when they came with 5 year standard warranties across the whole industry, a 5 year warranty today would be absurd, but I don’t see the average user using this drive up and throwing it away even inside that span. I certainly don’t think it’s OK for Seagate to throw their hands up and say “Well, we can’t guarantee the lifespan of this product for more than 12 months!”. That kind of rationale speaks volumes more to me than my other (fairly) petty gripes with this product.On top of the above point, the drive enclosure has no visible hardware indicating how it can be opened up. Appears to be non user serviceable, in other words."," Some real world benchmarks. The files transferred consisted of a mix of large single archival files, and lots of small media and data files.

The drive I received is perfectly functional and has been working flawlessly for the better part of three weeks, but in a culture of planned obsolescense, I don’t have a great feeling about only having one year of protection for something that easily has a five year useful lifespan, minimum. I went and looked at Seagates offerings for standalone 8TB drives, and they all have the (current) industry standard 3 year warranty. Considering that, my advice would be to buy a stand alone drive and an external enclosure. It’s unforunate, because I like the all in one plug and play package, and besides my beef with the warranty, my other complaints were fairly minor. However, considering the fact I’m sacrificing two years of warranty protection for the plug and play simplicity, I would go a different route.",17,19

The drive case has a pleasant appearance, which is nice if you plan on putting it on your desk. The drive does not get excessively hot (> 50C), even with extensive use. It comes with a 4 foot USB 3 cable."," Perhaps the only real negative is the fact that it is a little bit expensive, although not for a drive of this size. 8 GB is on the high end of portable drive capacity. The other thing is that it is a 3.5” form factor drive, meaning it needs an AC adapter, unlike 2.5” form factor drives, which can be powered from the USB port. One additional minor complaint is the AC adapter itself. It will almost certainly take up more than 1 spot on your surge suppressor/power strip (up to 3 on mine)."," I used the drive to back up every computer in my house, and it functioned perfectly. On computers with USB 3, data transfer was super fast. USB 2 is a little slow, but that is not the fault of this drive. With a USB 3 connection, I was able to back up some computers (including a full drive image) in less than one hour.In benchmarking, the drive compared well with internal SATA drives when plugged into a USB 3 port, and the temperature never exceeded 45C. High drive temperatures have been somewhat correlated with premature drive failure. Of course, putting the drive in an enclosed space with no air circulation would make it run much hotter.Overall I would say that this is a really nice portable hard drive and I would recommend it, mostly due to its massive capacity, portable size and excellent performance (fast and quiet).",3,3

It has a cool black color and geometric patterns on the case, it is relatively thin for an external drive, and in my opinion it looks great on the desk rather than detracting from the look of the desk.After doing some speed tests, I was impressed with the drive’s overall speed.  I was able to sustain speeds of over 30 megabytes per second (~240Mbps) even when moving large files (I tested with a 16GB file of all 0’s from dd).The drive is very quiet, so it’s not cumbersome leaving it on if that’s your plan.  After being left on for a few weeks, the enclosure is not hot on the outside, so I feel comfortable leaving this plugged in long term as well which is ideal for a backup drive.  I have a very large file server and this 8TB drive is the first drive large enough to be useful for me for backups as a single hard drive.  I am planning on mirroring my most important data from my file server to this drive for safekeeping.  With the drive being so large, it should be useful as a backup drive for any individual, maybe even for multiple computers at a small business.  8TB is a lot of storage!"," I have not found anything negative about this drive so far.  The speed, overall performance, and design are great.

I am running on system with SDD as my main drive and using this as my mass storage device.  I am using the built in backup for windows and a full backup with a disk image took about 1 hour 20 minutes.  Nothing to brag about but not bad either.  Backup size was over 50gb and took just a few minutes more to complete than doing a backup to an internal hard drive.Read speed is decent on USB 3.0.  Write speed is a little slow but still not bad for a USB drive.  My other Seagate Expansion is faster, but then it does not have nearly the storage space this drive has.  I do a lot of imaging and replacing hard drives on desktops and laptops.  This is perfect for holding the images.  I also have full images of all my system drives for all my computers.  Again, more than enough space.  The thing I like most about USB hard drive storage is I can power it up only when I need it.  I can copy all my important files and images and then set it aside and have peace of mind knowing my files will be there when I need them.  By powering off when I do not need it, I expect it will last quite a few years.I continue to find more uses for this drive since it seems like almost unlimited storage for me.

This is an ""archive"" grade disk in a plastic, fanless enclosure. It is not intended for gaming, video editing, high-demand NAS applications, etc. If that's what you need, just go right now and search for something else. (Hint: It's going to cost you more -- that's just how it is, you'll have to deal with that or blame yourself when you set this drive on fire because you didn't listen to me.)This drive is a good place to put weekly backups, old DVD images that you just want to archive, maybe video editing projects AFTER they're done that you just need to store. If your application sounds as demanding as this sort of thing, then this is a drive you might consider.The pros here are easy: speed and size. I'm listing speed as a pro because this is not an SSD or even an internal drive. This is a USB 3.0 external drive, and for my tests, under ideal circumstances, it makes good use of that bandwidth and performs as well as you could expect. The size is, of course, 8TB which is as big as these things really get right now.Here are the test results. Parts of what is listed might be considered negative; I'll discuss those parts in the cons section below. This was all using Crystal Disk Mark.9 rounds 100MB test:Sequential Read: 190.1 MB/sSequential Write: 142.4 MB/sRandom Read 512KB: 83.6 MB/sRandom Write 512KB: 20.5 MB/sRandom Read 4KB: 1.7 MB/sRandom Write 4KB: 7.4 MB/sThis first test seemed to go haywire on the 4KB read, so I tried again:5 round 50MB retest:Random Read 4KB: 16.5 MB/sRandom Write 4KB: 7.3 MB/sIt was clearly a fluke, something made the drive hang on one of the nine passes bad enough to throw the average way off. It is clear that this drive struggles to do things like random R/W, especially smaller chunks. It's not designed to do that. It's a massive, inexpensive hard drive. What did you expect? Even when it struggled through the tougher tests, it didn't get too hot (36 C).I did a few more tests just putting some stress on it.A file transfer of about 85GB of mixed media files (music and movies) ranging from 2MB to 4GB each. This test was constrained by speed of the older external HDD source, maxing out at about 35-40 MB/s steady ideally. The transfer ran at about 25-35 MB/s for larger files, about 15-20 MB/s for smaller, with regular peaking at 50ish and 8ish.It hit about 40 C about 5-10 minutes in, then slowly climbed to 50 C for the rest of the transfer. That's where I got a warning from disk monitoring utilities that the drive is getting close to serious heat, but not into critical levels.The 85 GB transfer took about an hour, but as I said, this Seagate was not the bottleneck. Verification took about 25 minutes at 2.7 MB/s (that's just a read through for checksum match).Even after an hour, sitting still and powered off, it was still at 46 C -- there is no fan, and even the passive cooling on this thing is awful.Another file transfer, 6.6GB file copied from an internal SSD took 2 minutes, pretty steady at 100+ MB/s. This is what you expect from a USB 3.0 HDD like this.I then formatted with encryption, the whole drive manually (including empty space). It took about 24 hours (which is typical and reasonable), and the temp plateaued at about 54 C.Then I reformatted back to nonencrypted and loaded it up with a huge volume of mixed file types / sizes.From a slower external USB drive, it managed 19 MB/s average (200 GB transferred).From an internal drive, it got up to 103 MB/s average (500 GB transferred).So it's doing fine on transfer speed, although during both of these tests, when the drive is really going for a couple hours, it will hit 55 C or even a bit higher."," So first, I'll point out that Seagate itself says its drives should not operate higher than 50 C. I think running at 55 C is probably not a death sentence or even a big worry, but it is an issue. Keep in mind, this was a brand new drive with more than adequate ventilation. Stack up a few of these, or accidentally drop a hand towel on top of it, the heat will become a serious issue.But, frankly, this drive runs hot. If you are writing out a big set of data, doing large backups, etc. -- even tasks this drive is meant for and in idea conditions -- this drive will get quite hot. Hot enough to have a meltdown and die? Probably not. But hot enough to shorten the lifespan of the product and/or increase the risk of data loss or other issues in the future? Maybe. I guess Seagate didn't want to raise the price of drives by $5 each by putting in just a little fan or anything. That brings me to problem number 2...This drive has a one year warranty. An external drive, put together in a nice little package, something that Seagate should be entirely responsible for. They can't back it up for more than one year? Maybe they are going to fail too often, or maybe somebody doing the actuarial tables over there thought they'd save enough money denying RMAs in month 13 to lower the price on this thing. But as a consumer, I don't care about statistics or bottom lines, I care about the quality of the goods. This warranty is just plain not good enough. The fact that the item doesn't even appear to exist anywhere except a couple online retailers. If Seagate doesn't list this product and doesn't offer much of a warranty on it, that makes me worry. I've been on the wrong end of RMAs and I think Seagate has a mediocre track record, at best. (Not that there aren't WAY worse ones out there, but I won't name names.)The speed (see above) is not great for random R/W, particularly in small chunks. This disk is what it is -- good for archival uses. However, higher quality 8TB drives exist, and external enclosures for such drives exist. I find it hard to argue that this drive has a special purpose that justifies its less-than-average performance if the value isn't there. The price on 8TB drives is coming down, and I'm not seeing much value here, especially considering the other two points I've made (heat/bad enclosure and warranty length).So I've listed speed as a pro and a con. It's up to you to decide how you want to split that hair. Again, it's a matter of value vs. quality, or maybe it's a bit of luck -- choosing a brand, model, size, speed, etc. for a drive is tricky but sometimes it comes down to luck when it comes to DOAs or early drive failures. If this product is the right product for you, that's good, but it might also be that some other product can do the job (or even better jobs) at a similar price. That's the ""shopping"" aspect of this that a single-item review like this can't help you too much with..."," I had a tough time deciding between 3 and 4 stars, but I eventually made my decision because this drive is new and already seems like it's going to get made obsolete before it's even useful to somebody. Wait a month and buy something better, or put together something better yourself for an extra $20. I don't see this drive becoming a staple of people's desktop PC tech before it's already too slow, unreliable, or unnecessary compared to better options, which are already creeping down into the same tier of affordability. That's -1 egg.The other -1 is for the warranty, not just because such a warranty automatically gets you -1 egg. Really, it's how that 1-year warranty appears in this situation. The ""optics"" if you know that new use of the term. This is a value-priced item that has nearly cutting-edge size. It comes in an enclosure that has poor passive cooling and no active cooling (and as we see, a heat issue). Replacing (or even opening) the case voids the warranty. Operating the drive above 50 C doesn't void the warranty, but it's not what Seagate recommends. So it's a little box of contradictions, and that worries me, especially given that we know it isn't the most mechanically adept device (hence the low speeds on the random R/W 4KB chunk tests). And, to be honest, the DOA reports I see when I look at reviews in aggregate make me think that the -1 for insultingly short warranty period says something about how little Seagate expects you to get out of these drives. For a drive that might serve as a backup, keep that in mind. Back up your cat photos here, and when it dies, your PC will survive long enough to get a replacement external HDD. Don't back up critical stuff. And let's be real. We all have 8TB of cat photos, right? Maybe that's just me.If I could, I'd give it 3.5 eggs, because together, I don't think these two issues are worth a full egg each for -2. There's enough good going on here that it's better than the average 3-egg review I might give. But I can't say it earned a full 4 eggs. (Shouldn't egg-based reviews be out of 6 or 12? That's how I buy my eggs.)Newegg EggXpert reviewers like me receive this item for free, so keep that in mind. We try to keep our reviews honest, and I hope this one has been honest. This is an item that's trying to split the difference between low-budget consumer needs and hitting that nearly-cutting-edge mark of 8TB. That's tough, and you can't blame Seagate if this isn't a perfect product -- if you buy this, you aren't willing to pay for the most perfect item out there (which would be some sweet $600 8TB drive that has stellar support, great QC, 5 year warranty, and an extra $90 for the most awesome external enclosure that exists). There are other options, with Seagate or otherwise: You can always try Seagate's other lines (e.g. ""Backup Plus"") which now also come in 8TB. Or buy a Seagate internal drive (""archive"" grade or regular) and throw it in an enclosure.But for the price, if you think this works for you, and you've read my review (and others) and think you want to go for it, I wouldn't recommend against it. This drive could very well be what you need. Just be sure you've thought it over, because it's not general purpose and it may not be up to the task (or might be too much of a rolling-the-dice situation in terms of quality). That's for you to decide.Keep in mind we EggXperts also can't wait too long to review. I'd love to run this product hard for a year and let you guys know that it lasts long, but I've only had it for about 20 days. For all I know, every single one of these lasts 100 years ... or maybe every single one dies on day 21. Longevity is very unpredictable for products that are new to the market or are hitting new high marks in size, speed, etc. (or low points in price).And if you're wondering about this ""line"" of drives, you can always uncheck the box that says ""Item Specific Reviews"" and you'll see all the ratings for this drive in every variation (in this case, in every size). For some things (e.g. headphones that come in different colors), this is a MUST when you want to read reviews right. For these drives, it gives you a good idea of how reliable or good the NON-drive parts of this product are. It won't tell you about this 8TB drive though, which itself is VERY different from its 2-5TB cousins.Oh and one final thought -- the software that comes with drives is, and has been for 20 years, totally irrelevant. Don't even bother. Some of the diagnostics are mildly useful, but the backup software etc. are not worth your time. If you are serious about backups, you need to pay for the software separately. Don't make your decision based on what comes with the drive.",7,9

I was assigned to review a 5TB drive awhile ago and it is around twice the size of this drive.  It has a nice case with a kind of diamond pattern.  This thing is BLAZING fast but then again it is my first USB 3.0 device.  It works well with my Mac but I am not sure about the USB 3.0 as I have an older MacBook Air.  I have always preferred Seagate drives but then began to have some issues with reliability and having to RMA some of my drives.  Now Seagate seems to have figured out any issues they may or may not have had., The dreaded power brick.  This drive has it.  It uses up an outlet and blocks one possibly two others.  They are annoying.  They are unnecessary.  Companies should stop using them.  I don't even care how but they need to definitely work on getting rid of the on plug power brick.," I would definitely recommend this drive if you are looking for an external hard drive.  It's big, it's fast, and it even looks nice (if you can get around the annoying power brick).",0,1
N82E16822178951,22-178-951,8/28/2016 3:43:44 PM,Kenith H.,"Bigger Storage, Not Bigger Waistline!",3," 8TB – Had me thinking it was going to be pretty big. It really hasn’t beefed up in size any! May even be a bit smaller! Only an inch and half wide with a depth of slightly under 7 inches and height of 4 and a quarter it’s like a small book. Wish I looked at the specifications page on newegg before I pulled out my tape measure. Would have saved me some time there!With 8TB, this is a great way to protect multiple PCs in the house. It’s as fast as one can expect from a mechanical disk drive and I’d say that I averaged around the 120MB/s range for my PC. This is a great choice till they come out with multi-terabyte solid state drives or sticks. Because of course, at that time people would rather watch their files backup 200x faster or more which mechanical drives wouldn’t be able to compete with. So if you’re in the market for a large storage device, this may be the last one you buy! Next ones may be SSD! Next ones may be SSD Flash drives! If you can get 8TB flash storage with 1.2GB/s transfer speeds, you’ll be laughing at this at that point! But for now it does the job!Control over the LED is nice. The case design is really nice in my opinion. Not 100% smooth like an ipod where it slips out of your hand like butter, but not a horrible design. It’s diamond side panels makes it comfortable to pick up without any issues. It’s a very simple case. USB plug and power port is it. I didn’t even know it had an LED till I plugged it in."," The included software was useless. I tried doing the register product which led to a broken link and the software closes not letting you do anything else. A manual search on the Seagate site shows a bunch of software to choose from. However, I had to open another window to search information on what Lyve was for example. Clicking them in download just downloaded them. All in all, not a very good first impression for new users. In fact, I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone because I’d have to also explain everything to them to support my recommendation. If the company can’t make it simple enough for my friends to use, I learned to keep my mouth shut. Now I tried this again in Chrome as I’ve learned that using a different browser can often provide different results. Then I tried Edge again, and somewhere I made a mistake because now the Lyve and driver for support on MAC and such have disappeared. Apparently I found a downloads page with more options? If you choose “Support / By Topic / Downloads like I did the first time, you get a bunch of options that don’t have much of a description. If you choose “Support / By Product / Desktop External” you come to a page where you must choose what kind of drive you have. Expansion Hard Drive and it is simplified. This just makes me not even want to use any of their software. The Lyve choice where you are able to access your media in original format on any of your devices sounds a bit interesting. I like how with the paragon driver offered on the downloads page, you would be able to plug your drive in a MAC if yours is formatted for PC and vice versa if it isn’t. Very handy if you tote this to the family reunion to share videos and you still have those family members using the opposite platform than you! However, the SeaTools keeps freezing up when it goes to scan the USB. I rebooted the computer, tried a different USB port, and it still froze “Not Responding” on the USB scan. I’m willing to bet that the reason may be the Western Digital drives I got plugged in and I am not going to unplug them to check. If Seagate doesn’t play well with others, then Seagate will just be used differently. The only thing I got working is the Seagate Drive Settings which the only function I get from it is testing the drive and turning off the LED. (The sleep setting I actually set within windows power management advance features. But for those that don’t know their way around windows THAT much because those settings are a pain to find, this will help keep your drive from powering down. “Which I turned off because when a drive powers down, it usually locks up the computer on me when I try to access it.”Mechanical Hard Drives are just a big pain in the rear with all the extras! It’s best to just use this to back things up and then unplug it. When we get SSDs this big, they should work the way one would expect. As for now, too much work to get something working the way it should."," Some may say Pro and some may scream Con that the top is solid and not vented like the back.Heat rises and it would be a great place for heat to escape. But a vented top may also make for quicker death if someone was to accidently spill liquid near it. Tomatoes ; tomato, as long as the drive stands up to time, who cares where the vents are placed. If you care that much, stand it on its face and let the heat rise up the back and top with that placement and you’d have that nice blue LED staring right at you! You shouldn’t move or pick up the drive when it is plugged in. The disk spin so fast you can feel the g-force within! I love hard drives and I enjoy testing them, but I am at the point where the same problems and same software issues are getting annoying and old. Solid State drives will be replacing these like CDs did cassette tapes. I think I am done with mechanical hard disks. I wanted to give it 4 stars because it's 8TB... But the whole idea of a desktop drive is to backup up your stuff. The software that was suppose to make this happen has failed. It's brand new and they had a broken link to registration. They only offer a 1 year warranty where others offer 3 to 5... Sorry, but I can't just go Wahoooo! when there is so much improvement needed.",0,2

Data transfer rates are pretty quick definitely worth the sale price., First thing I noticed was the connector for the USB 3 cable on the drive itself.  seems like the metal tab that surrounds the pins is bent.  I had to carefully bend it back.Also when I connected the power cord the port is somewhat pushed under the plastic.  It wasn't aligned at all.  I noticed that the plastic case was sitting on top of the tabs that would otherwise be locked in. I was able to see inside the drive.   I had to carefully try to slide the case back to get the tabs seated correctly.  Not worth sending back.  But I am disappointed with the way it came in.

This isn't a problem if you're employing a dedicated computer running media server software like JRiver Media Center, Media Monkey and the like."," Absurdly easy to set up. I was stunned that it wasn't far more difficult.This drive is used primarily as the centralized network storage drive for my music library. It serves multiple computers and Android tablets using JRiver Media Center on Gigabit ethernet and Wi-Fi. The tablets mostly pipe the tunes to the ridiculously good G-Boom bluetooth portable speakers (great for shop, garage and outdoors).  Most of the music files are in lossless FLAC format so they're quite a bit larger but far better sounding than MP3. This little NAS has had ZERO problems handing five simultaneous music data streams at once.If this thing dies, I'll likely get another. To get appreciably better, I would have to upgrade to an Intel Zeon-based FreeNAS server running RAID 1 mirroring, with dual Gigabit LAN connections and THAT runs about $1500 and up, waaay up.",1,1

This has huge capacity which I've already filled half.  Seems plenty fast enough as long as you have it connected to a USB 3.0 port.  This replaced an old Seagate 500GB external backup which has only USB 2.0.  This WD 3TB drive blows it away speed-wise.," The only thing I'm not happy with is the bundled backup software.  It's bloated, difficult to use and very unintuitive.

I've loaded it up about half full and so far everything is working very well.  Even though it doesn't have a fan it doesn't get too hot.  A different enclosure I have without a fan the drive gets so hot I fear it might damage it, this is not the case with this.  At best I can feel a slight warms when touching the enclosure or feeling the vents for heat.  The drive inside is WD WD30EZRX which spins at only 5400 RPM but only takes up 6W of power on load which is partly why no fan is needed.  It is whisper quiet because of the good enclosure design.  At arms length away you will not be able to notice that it's on except for the light which is a nice soft white.  The power plug does not have a power brick in the middle so the plug to the wall is a bit of a brick, not oversized but I'd rather the brick be in the middle of the cord to free up space on the wall outlet.  I purchased this for cheaper than it costs for the drive inside.  Packaged software that it comes with is good but as I'll be using it for a NAS I have not used it too much.  Excellent buy so far.  Gave 4 eggs for the cons though I suppose it would have been more expensive had it fixed those issues.",4,4

USB3.0 not functional?",3," I've had a couple BUFFALO products before, and since the drive helps me sidestep the bother I see surrounding Seagate&Samsung drives poor QOM, I was happy to spend a little extra on this drive. Got it quickly. Setup was (barring the issue reported below) super easy - plug to power, plug to USB, you're off to the races. Transferring files was no big deal, as it shouldn't be, and the drive seems to pull files reliably to send through Plex, my home media server. The desktop footprint is small and unassuming, and it blissfully has only one LED, which reports if the drive is performing an operation by means of a slow fade/blink. Fan noise and heat are minimal."," -The drive says it can operate in a standing position, but no bracket is included to keep the drive upright. Guess you gotta count on yourself not to knock it over.-I noticed when moving all of my movies/music/shows from my internal HDD over to this that it was performing at a speed pretty typical of USB2.0, not the expected USB3.0 (something like 50MB/s.) Now, I could be making this up and the slow transfers could be just a result of it being (I think) a 5400RPM drive, but it seemed abnormally slow. Compound that with the fact that while all my other USB3.0 devices can be seen in the Windows SDK's ""USBView"" utility, and are happy to report what spec they're connected at, this device crashes USB View whenever you try to inspect it. Docking some Eggs for that, and hoping BUFFALO can help clear this up. I'll revise the review then."," Sadly, I can't at this point report on the real thing I think everybody wants to know about when buying an external HDD: reliability. As it is, I've owned it only a weekend, and haven't really given it much opportunity to fail. I'll update this review (if I can remember!) once I have more info on that factor.UPDATE 3/24: Not getting remarkably better. After establishing that all other USB devices report correctly in USBView and only the extHDD crashes USBView, I opened a ticket. I promptly got the reply that the problem was probably... everything else in the chain. But not the drive. Never the drive. So the utility, the USB drivers, the USB controller itself.

Even if you do load all the software it wants you to, it will still behave strangely."," The onboard firmware automatically places a Z:\ drive on the computer, the sole purpose of which appears to be to provide you with superfluous software for someone who just wants a place to store data that is external (portable).  No WD hard drive I've ever had  before (including externals) needed fancy drivers to work.  Maybe since this one is 1TB that changes things, but even when I did install all of the software it wanted me to, it still acted weird.  When I go into my computer, and navigate more than a level or two into any of my drives, I hear a buzzing noise and then for the next five seconds or so, the computer will not respond to input from the keyboard or mouse.  Any clicks or keystrokes made during that time buffer and take effect after the aforementioned five seconds.  It happens a lot, multiple times a day.  This started pretty much from day one.After I'd had the hard drive for about a year and a half, it disappeared from among my drives in my computer/windows explorer.  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling drivers, and it didn't work for me, although a friend of mine with more tech skill was able to get my computer to recognize the drive again and part of what he did was uninstalling and reinstalling drivers.  That happened about a year ago and it just happened again this month.  He downloaded updated firmware and ""smartware"" for it, which I successfully used as a means to get my computer to again recognize this hard drive, although I ended up having to reformat my C:\ drive first.My friend told me that he saw over 2,000 registry entries associated with my external hard drive, and he believed that it effectively caused the drivers to get pooched, or at least caused degraded performance.I will grant that this may be the result of user error.  I have always left the hard drive plugged in and running, and it sits about a foot and a half away from the back of my computer.  Maybe it's getting too hot, though I doubt it.  I always left my WD external I got back in 2003 plugged in all the time and it never gave me these problems.  But my friend suggested I only plug it in when actively using it, and only use it to store data, as opposed to mounting disk images stored on it for active use (ala alcohol 120).  Maybe I was supposed to not have it plugged in under normal circumstances all this time.  If so, couldn't WD have said something about it in the users manual?  A warning of some kind?And still, I strongly object to bloated software and drivers.  WD used to not clutter up my computer with a heavy software footprint.  I just need the hard drive to run reliably.  I don't need automated backups, an icon in my system tray, and a drain on my system resources.  I don't need registry entries accumulating to outrageous proportions and degrading my computer's performance, but that may be more of a windows issue than a WD one.  Still, someobody needs to address it.I hear WD is still the best.  The competition must REALLY suck.",0,1

I purchased a Tivo Premier a few months ago and I was filling up my HD really quickly. Once my tivo got 75% full it started to slow down so I decided to purchase a expander HD. I searched the internet for the best price on the WD My Book 1tb I found some around $109-$114 price range but I had a promotional code for $20 off from Newegg so I decided to purchase the WD from them. It only took about 5 - 10 minutes to install and my available space jumped from having only 15% to having 85% available space. Now I have the freedom to record as much as I want without having to worry about losing older recording. The new look of the WD My Book looks really sleek its all glossy black with a single greyish light in the middle it goes really well with my PS3/TV/BR Plyr & LED HDTV.", The customer service at Newegg isn't as good. I purchased the item on Friday morning hoping to get it shipped out by the end of that business day but on Moday I get an e-mail telling me that the item is backordered and my order has been canceled. So I contact Newegg and was told my order was canceled due to back ordered but the website stated that they had them in stock Friday and again on Monday. The customer Rep told me that they had them in stock and I should submit a second order as my old order was canceled. I tried to get him to resubmit my order through the phone but was told  policy does not allow him to do that. So by the end my credit card was charged twice for the same item and a week later refunded the first order. I do not get why they had to cancel my order if the item was never really on backorder.," Overall the WD My Book 1tb is a must have for a Tivo Premier, especially if you record HD shows. 45 hours of HD isn't enough, I easily filled my hard drive in a month the extra space is really worth the extra purchase.",2,2

This WD 1TB AV eSata DVR Expander is the answer to the problem and actually is the only one that works.  Do not buy anything else.  I have a HR20 & a HR21 HD-DVR and I have had -0- issues.All you have to do is the following:- Unplug the power cable to the HD-DVR.- Connect the DVR Expander (the eSata cable in the box is fine) to the HD-DVR.  Only use e-Sata - do not even consider USB - too slow.- Turn on the Expander.- Turn on the HD-DVR.That is it - it will format and work as if it is an internal HD with no signal delays.  Just be sure to put the Expander on the same UPS as the DVR so that you do not have a power lost problem.NOTE: The internal HD becomes non-existent and you cannot see or access it.  Watch those shows first or copy onto a DVR if you want them., -0-, Your Satellite/Cable provider should have a list of compatible  external HD's.  Check there first and there should be no issues.  WD should be on all their lists.  Write a letter to DirecTV & ask them to make 1TB internal HD'sEverything from NewEgg over the years. Great service and delivery. NewEgg Rocks,2,2

The other didn't."," I have a Seagate Free Agent Go. I have used it for 5 years and it's still working fine. I use WD in all other builds for internal drives. I hope for the best with their external drives. I have no use for the software, but some might find it useful. I now own 2 of these WD Passport Ultra 2TB. They have been working fine in the first week. I took one out of the box and transferred 1.5TB worth of video at one time and got decent speeds. About double the speed in a USB3.0 port than USB 2.0 ports. The older 2.0 ports might struggle to power this drive. I have a box from 2009 I built. Top of the line at the time and it powers the drive in some ports but not others......might be another problem besides power.....I don't know. It worked fine in the end. Both newer systems and a new laptop run this drive great.",5,5

Comes with cloth cover.This is a replacement drive as first one failed early. It has been running fine now.," First drive failed to mount cleanly after first use. I did a proper eject so that wasn't the issue. I tried mounting on 3 USB controllers and was able to see it again after the 3rd try, long enough to delete my data. The WD Utilities were worthless. The clear drive function failed. I even tried reformatting but that failed. WD eval routines also failed.It wanted me to update my SES driver, even though I already had the latest. I tried calling WD but eventually hung up due to the wait. The website is not bad, but by that time I had already determined that I just had a dud. Duds happen to any company. I have had great luck with WD drives.One scary thing. The first time I mounted it, I used their password utility. The one time I successfully re-mounted it, the drive no longer had any password protection. The security software seems to work on the second drive. It does have a tendency to leave drive letters used on Windows. That might be a side effect, like TrueCrypt.The replacement drive was also very slow. It did speed up quite a bit when I changed from the Windows default of not using on-drive buffering. I have not experienced that much of a change in speed with any of my other 20+ drives between this setting. The difference in drive speed is also quite noticeable between this drive and a Seagate 1T 2.5"" portable, both drives on same controller with same test data set. Of course I would expect the 1TB drive to be faster, but it is considerably faster.Cloud stuff is nothing but instructions on how to use drop box. Marketing at it's finest! ;)Only difference between the Ultra and a regular Passport is the name and the cloth bag. It is nice, but not worth the extra money!"," The case is top notch.I have heard that they have had QC issues with the 0n-board controller. It sounds to me like this was the issue with my first drive.One odd thing is that with one of my USB-2 controllers, the drive made a bad clicking noise. I tried it a couple of times and got the same noise. I did not hear this noise with my USB-3 controller or a different USB-2 controller. This could be a side effect of the bad Passport controller, or it could be a compatibility issue with various USB controllers.",8,8

Many portable drives come with these short cables."," We've had a few external drives over the years, some of which were self-contained while others were bare drives which we placed inside external cases. For a long time speed was limited to around 30MB/sec. because that's all you can get on a USB 2.0 connection. But now external / portable drives have matured; now they can show a turn of speed over USB 3.0, reaching upwards of 70MB/sec. at least. When we transferred 120GB of HD video this little Ultra clocked a sustained rate of 88MB - 90MB/sec.Probably would have stayed with big file portability as the main use for the Ultra if i hadn't tried the backup software. Seriously, this is as easy as it gets. Let the software scan your whole computer for photos, music, video, etc. then allow it to backup as much of the resulting list as you want. After we confirmed that it found all our media we told it to backup everything. After that, it will automatically backup any new stuff we save on our computer. Couldn't be easier.We don't use Dropbox, but we had no problem selecting all the photos we like and uploading them to our own cloud storage. Uploading to the cloud does not take advantage of the Ultra's speed but it gets the job done while you go on doing other things.  Previous external drives had the disadvantages of being bulkier, running hotter and making more noise. My Passport Ultra is sleek, cool and nearly silent. Place it on your shortlist of worthy contenders.",3,4

9SIA4T01GT5698,22-236-568,11/14/2013 11:09:38 PM,David K.,The Ultimate Portable Drive,5," I just want to start by saying that this drive the by far the best external hard drive ever conceived.  I own 6 different external drives and this one blows them all away.   To start, the drive requires no external power source.  You just plug it into the USB port and you're ready to go.  It's USB 3.0 native.  There is a very clear difference in speeds between USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports.  This thing is blazing fast for an external hard drive.  I have seen burst reads and writes of 500 MB/sec and sustained reads and writes of 90 MB/sec.  Of course, like any other drive, at least in my experience, the speed will eventually level off on the larger file transfers.  With USB 3.0 it normally levels off around 60-70 MB/sec on average to large files and with USB 2.0 it drops to around 30 MB/sec for larger files.  The convenience of a portable hard drive can not be overstated.  This drive is fairly small, especially for a 2 TB.  It's got a bit of weight to it, heavier than the 1 TB WD My Passport I own.  You can easily fit it in your jacket pocket and take it to wherever you might need to go.  They add in a nice little pouch to carry it in.  Which is nice, as I was carrying my other portable drive in a zip-lock bag.  I have put these drives to the test, taking them in from 20 degree F weather after sitting in my car all day, plugging it in and it fired up straight away.  No hiccups, no issues.  I've also dropped mine on a number of occasions and it has never hesitated to work perfectly.  This drive comes formatted for Windows out of the box. There is also software onboard to format for the Mac OS, and there are also identical drives preconfigured for Mac. As with most other external hard drives, it comes with software preinstalled for data backup. The back up software is easy to use. You can configure the back up manually or let it go automatically. The auto backup will auto locate your files, categorize them and automatically prioritize them and create a schedule for back ups. Doing it manually is just like any other back up software, add files, choose when to back them up and how often to repeat. The Passport Ultra also has the option to backup to the cloud.  You need to create a Dropbox account to use the cloud backup option.  Dropbox is free with 2 GB of cloud storage with the option to upgrade to a larger amount or earn free space by completing a few easy steps and referring friends.   My Passport also comes with recovery software. If you need to backup a file that's become corrupted or deleted it gives you the option to choose which version of the file you want to recover based on date. There is included utility and security software on this drive.  You can set up your drive to require a password upon opening and there is also the option to apply hardware encryption on your drive to keep your data private.  The utility software allows you to run diagnostics if you're having issues with something or to perform preventative maintenance.", None.  I own two of these and they're both extremely fast and reliable as well as convenient.," I gave this drive 5 Eggs. I don't hand out that kind of rating unless the item is the best in it's class. In my opinion, this drive is just that. I was so happy with this drive I recommended it to my Uncle for use in his business. This drive has it all, speed, portability, features and capacity. It's the total package. If I ever need another external hard drive again, I'm getting another one of these. I have used this drive on the X Box 360 and the Wii U.  You have to partition part of the drive for use on those systems and it's got the speed to run games straight off of the drive without any kind of lag, so I can stop buying discs. I would never buy another disc again if I could get away with it.  Including BD-R.  When you consider how much 50 GB BD-R discs cost, its cheaper and more convenient to get one of these to hold your movies and games.",5,5
9SIA4T01GT5698,22-236-568,11/12/2013 8:58:58 PM,David H.,Beat expectations. Excellent Drive.,5," I have several other external hard drives that I use, a few of them are USB 3.0. NONE of them compare to this one. I'll get to the numbers in a minute, but let me just say that I will never buy another external hard drive again without taking a serious look at the Ultra series. I have a standard My Passport 2 TB USB 3.0 drive and this thing blows it out of the water. Here are a few notes I took while testing:- Good packaging- Sleeve is a nice touch- Went to Western Digital to get the latest software since the software on the drive was from early 2013. Once installed software worked perfectly. The backup software was easy to use, had good options and had two modes Categorized Backup (ie music, videos, documents, email, etc) and File Backup. I'm not entirely sure how accurate it is though because it said I have over 75 gigs of videos/movies, but this computer is my work laptop and I don't have anything like that on here. There is, however a file/folder mode and that's probably what I'll do instead of the ""Smart"" categorized mode. - Drive is FAST.  Writes at over 112 megabytes a second?! I thought, ""that can't be right."" Tried it again. This time I transferred 30 gigs in under 5 minutes! Wow! Granted the drive was empty, essentially, but wow. Burst read speeds were up over 214.3 megs a second via HD Tach. The average read for the entire drive was up over 91.6 megs a second. Honestly, I'm blown away I was not expecting a portable hard drive to perform like this.", Zero. Nothing.," Aside from the performance, there's a good warranty too. Honestly, this drive was fabulous. I will only recommend these drive from now on to my family and friends. The price is a little steeper than most, but what you gain in performance outweighs the cost, in my opinion. Fantastic job Western Digital. I've found this drive on a sale in a few other places. Not that I don't love Newegg and usually they are the lowest, because I do, but when you can find it for over $10, that's a great deal. Either way, can't go wrong and I'm sure Newegg will have these on sale at some point. Great get!",3,3
9SIA4T01GT5698,22-236-568,11/4/2013 5:11:00 PM,Kathy D.,Bjduffee,5," Small size, robust backup solution, Continuous backup options, Revision history, Drive password security."," Price, activity light is kind of bright."," : I have a lot of good things to say about this drive. First off I’ll talk about the physical drive.It has a very solid case that is around the drive. It also is a 2.5” drive so it has a very small form factor. It is USB powered so no additional power cable is needed. And it’s USB 3.0 so speeds are very nice for this drive. Also it comes with a nice soft carry bag. That may not seem like a big deal but when transporting the drive you don’t have to worry about losing the cable since it’s in the bag.Now for the transfer speeds.I’m going to keep this simple. On USB 3.0 I was averaging 100 MB\s while moving data to and from the drive. While on USB 2.0 I was averaging 30 MB\sAnd finally the software that comes with the drive. This drive is a little pricey and you can find 2TB drives for cheaper but the software is what makes this drive a winner.  First it comes with a password encryption software to allow you to password protect your drive and even allows you to save your login as an auto login account to prevent you from having to type in the password every time. Next is the utilities program that allows you to run diags, set sleep timers and do proper drive wipes for your data. And finally is the backup software which I feel is great for free software with a drive. This software scans your drive and separates all your data into categories.  Next you select which areas you want to back up and too where you want to backup. It offers backup options to Drop Box which is nice but since the free drop box account is only 2G it does limit you. I chose to just backup to the drive only. Once you have decided to backup you can schedule backups or do a continuous backup. The continuous backup is awesome great since this software allows for revisions on the data. What that means is if you did continuous backups you can have revisions (5 revisions by default and more if you choose) and those revisions allow you to restore a file back days in case you mess it up and accidentally save it. So if you mess up a file and save it and don’t realize it until the 3rd time you open it, you can go back to the 5th revision and it will restore back to the file before you messed it up even though you have saved over it 3 times. (Incredible for free software) And the restore options are very granular which allows you to pick and choose what files you want to restore and not all of them. It also allows you to restore to the original location or to another location in case you want to keep the original file.In conclusion this is more than just a portable drive, it is a storage drive and all in one backup option for your home computer that was a whole lot more than I expected.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for such and you will not be disappointed. If you are just looking for storage space this will work for you but there are other options out there for less up front cost.",2,2

Tried a couple different partitions….Still doesn't want to take.  So i tried the simplest thing - copied a small folder of photos directly to the partition:  it allowed the jpgs to copy but gave me an error message that my 3 GoPRO movie files failed. So it seems to have a mind of its own.  I've never had a hard drive tell me that it wouldn't ""copy"" a file to its folder????  :)  I wanted to make sure it wasn't my movie files so I duplicated the copy process to my existing hard drive and snap snap - just like that no problems, all files copied!  A Geek friend of mine spent an hour talking me thru different steps to try to make it work and he finally said - give up, you must be lucky and gotten yourself a defective one.

MY laptop only registered 2TB and I had to update it in order for it to register the full 4(3.6) TB. Passive cooling so when run continuously it does get hot and when running a full backup on a 1TB machine it ran borderline hot where I couldnt touch it. Needs an internal fan to help keep things cool for true backup needs.Power brick could be of a smaller kind or one that plugs into a transformer of sort like on laptops. As it stands it requires a large outlet and may take up two spots on a power strip.Failed to finish my initial backup due to heat, but it was on a 90 degree day so I put one of my 3krpm fans on the vents to help cool it and it did help to an extent. Was able to rerun backup and it took 3 1/2 hours for a 1.2Tb backup."," I like this drive as it is fast for the speed at which it runs and its also quiet. which is a rarity among all the drives I have, needless to say I freaked out a couple times because I could not hear it and thought it had died, but alas its just that quiet compared to other drives. At least drives I own. The power brick I can deal with as I have a universal power strip designed for power bricks as all my backup equipment has them....cant wait for companies to step up and use step down transformers so we can have single space plugs.The hard drive is truly plug and play, plugged right into my main desktop and did a small backup with ease using USB 3.0, but on my laptop I had to update drivers which was no big deal seeing as I never use it. File transfer is rather fast and a bit slow with USB 2.0 but that is to be expected as it doesnt have the capability to transfer at higher speeds.Warranty is only 1 year and that concerned me seeing as the design is passive cooling. This bothered me not knowing which drive was inside, so I did open it up to check as my disk manager was not reporting the drive properly.Upon opening I found the drive to be HDD.15 ST4000DM000, like another review mentioned these drives do not have the best reliability. After my initial testing and having to use the fan on the vents to do a backup, i decided I wanted to make the fan permanent. I traced out the fan slot on the cover I removed and cut it out. For this part I used a mesh fan cover and a slimline 92mm Silverstone fan. I know this voids my warranty entirely but after having several drives fail over the years I rather run on the side of being cautious and over prepared to help the drive last longer than a year.All in all I would buy this drive and use it for backups, but only when needed and not plugged in all the time to better extend its life cycle",18,20

It'll spin and work for about a minute, the drive will making a single chirp sound and then it'll fail."," First, why I bought it: I bought this because I have recently purchased an SSD for my laptop. I wanted to preserve all my files that were on the original HDD but having only 1 SATA port, I needed a fairly large external to back-up and later restore Windows from.  I choose WD because they were a trusted brand. So after ordering and all that jazz, it arrived and boy was I happy. I immediately plugged it in and let windows install the standard drivers and following that I installed the WD software included on the drive. That all went of without a hitch. From there I went to use the built-in windows back-up software. I set it up and whatever and then sat and watched it for a bit to make sure it wouldn't have any problems. To my surprise, less than a minute in the drive makes a chirp sound and failed. I read the error from windows and it said the drive was not ready. So I tried again and again and that's what started me doing what I stated below to try fixing it.I've tried quite a bit to try making this work. I've tried both my USB ports (2.0 and 3.0), Rolled back and updated drivers in different combinations, plugging into a powered usb 3.0 hub to allow to draw more power than it typically would be able to(After I tried directly to the port). I've tried formatting the drive and even sent in for a new one. All this and it still will not work for me. Now since I have already sent it in for warranty once, I can't send it in again.

I am happy to say there have been NO failures of the 21 drives in 9 months. I recently needed to upgrade my 'Movie' computer and bought 6 more drives. While I did not encounter any failures, I was disappointed. I didn't notice that Seagate markets the external 8TB drives two ways, the Backup Plus and the Expansion packages. I'll focus on the differences noting that the actual drives are IDENTICAL. However, the warranty on the Expansion drive is only 1 year while the Backup Plus is 2 years. If you want to remove the drive from the enclosure and reuse the enclosure, say for the drive being replaced, the Backup Plus is MUCH more friendly to disassemble and reuse (as-is or just using the frame sitting on a desk to temporarily connect a drive to a computer). The Expansion enclosure will be nearly destroyed and the SATA3 to USB3 adapter is taped to the drive as there is no frame. Also, the Backup Plus packages came with 2 year, 200GB One Drive Cloud storage, for those who use the Cloud.I'd give this drive 4 1/2 eggs if I could.

Works well with out the WD software., Included software created all kinds of system issues., Multiple reboots required and it even managed to crash Windows XP in safe mode. I also used it with an Win 7 64 Pro box and it killed that box multiple times as well. The greatest frustration is that it caused crashes any time from post during boot up to backing up files to the drive. The software looks great in theory but there is not much use for a backup drive if it is what creates the need for a backup.All went back to normal after I was able to get it off of the computers.,1,1

They stated that I could at the very least and with their help remotely use the device as a backup to create mirror images of my OS. With all the time and no resolution I have no choice but to return.

9SIA9DE3SA7968,22-136-747,11/13/2012 6:22:40 PM,Richard B.,Nice External Drive,5, This drive stands on the desk like a book. It looks like a book and is heavy enough to stay put. Has a small white activity light that can be seen even at extreme angles. Very fast with USB 3. Windows reported a speed of about 1.2Gb/s (150MB/s)both up and down. Faster than my 2.5inch external drives. Is recognized and installed automatically on both Windows 7 and Windows XP with no problems. Quiet operation., Drive requires the included external power pack so you need an additional power receptacle.," I set this drive on the desk, plugged in and it acts just like a drive installed inside the machine. It looks really good on my desk and doesn't get in the way like the smaller pocket size drives that I have where I have to be careful not to catch the cable with something and sweep it off onto the floor. This drive stands right next to the computer and makes a good permanent backup drive. The supplied external transformer is required since it is a 3.5 inch form factor drive, but my power strip had an empty spot for it.",2,2
9SIA9DE3SA7968,22-136-747,10/26/2012 8:22:15 PM,Mike C.,"Good secondary drive, great backup drive.",4," I like the 6 foot power cable that came with this drive, which is a foot longer than normal. When I plugged this drive into my USB 3.0 port, Windows 7(64bit) instantly recognized it as “WD My Book 1140 USB Device” and made it available for use. The drive inside has a variable spin speed set during manufacturing to offer the best balance between temperature and power use, but it can mean that performance may vary from disk to disk. The USB3.0 interface definitely made this drive faster than other USB 2.0 drives, or when plugged into a USB2.0 port, as it achieved 82MB/s writes and 95MB/s reads in large file transfer tests, which is in the top performing desktop hard disks that I’ve looked at. Small file transfers were somewhat slower, which is normally the case in storage tests – 26MB/s writes and 45MB/s read speeds, which is about average for a drive this size. After testing the drive with SMART tests and disk check, I successfully copied a mirrored backup of 6,972 files, or 910.62GB  of the 931.48GB available from another 1TB drive in my PC. This took about 5 hours to do.  I plan on using it as a simple redundant back up drive to hide away in my fire protected safe for 6 month intervals, and for this purpose the drive is great.  There is also a power button on the back of the drive which is a nice addition to the My Book Essentials lineup."," I did not install the SmartWare backup program because I already have a paid version of SyncBackPro which offers superb amounts of utility and options, and it did not offer me the option of installation location, which I really don’t like, so I have no comments on this program. Also, when installing SmartWare, it tries to sneak in an installation of McAfee antivirus free. I consider this bloatware since it’s something I did not want and do not need, so watch out for that if you don’t want it.The only major complaint I have about this drive is the time it takes to “wake up” or spin up from sleep mode. It takes a full 15 seconds. My older external USB drive only takes 5 seconds to wake from sleep mode. This makes the sleep function very undesirable if you are using this drive for daily activity (which you can disable in the software settings). My other gripe about the drive is that you can buy the 3TB version of the drive for just 50 bucks more. The terabyte to dollar ratio is significantly less for the 1TB version, but if you don’t want to spend the extra 50 bucks, go for it, as it’s still a very decently priced 1TB external storage device."," IN THE BOX: Simple picture installation sheet, warranty and tech support guide, power cable, USB 3.0 cable, and My Book Essentials drive. The 32 bit and 64 bit drivers, a detailed manual (written in 23 languages in .pdf format), and the WD SmartWare program for PC and Mac are on the NTFS formatted drive ready for installation. WD SmartWare is a data backup and restoration program that comes installed on Western Digital external hard drives. The program runs as a virtual CD-ROM drive on your system. The WD SmartWare software allows you to perform a selective backup of the data on your primary hard drive, and then restore the backup from the external drive when necessary. It also comes with a formatting utility, and a drive lock utility that allows you to password protect your external drive so it can’t be used by those without it.  I was pleased with the overall looks of the drive, which is shiny piano black with rounded corners and edges keeping it from looking too boxy. There are cooling vents in the top back side and top edge of the casing but no active cooling fans. This should be sufficient cooling for the WD green drive inside as long as you don’t seal off the venting somehow. In the front of the drive unit, there is a pinhole with a white LED light behind it that blinks when accessing the drive, and is solid ‘on’ otherwise.Total capacity is 1,000,169,533,440 bytes (931GB). Approximately 930 GB of actual storage space is typical for an advertised 1TB drive, and it is a common misconception between Binary and Decimal drive capacity, and will be witnessed for any storage device. Information regarding specifications for the differentiation between Binary and Decimal drive capacities can be found by viewing the information provided by this link on WD’s website. http://wdc.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/615Here is a link to the online user manual on WD’s website. http://www.wdc.com/wdproducts/library/UM/ENG/4779-705019.pdf",3,3
9SIA9DE3SA7968,22-136-747,10/25/2012 4:09:43 PM,Greg P.,Nice Looking Drive,5," Very attractive 1 Tb external hard drive with ventilation holes (that in prior models were actually readable morse code). It looks like a book, has a USB 3 interface and comes with a separate power adapter. The power light is unobtrusive. Inside the case (don’t do this with yours) I found an IntelliPower 1Tb WD10EUCX with a 6GB/s SATA connector. It comes with some bundled (free) software that is intended to make it more useful for backup, to control some drive parameters, and to do diagnostics. The software is not necessary to use the drive. It has a Drive Power button on the back. It is backwardly compatible with USB2. It comes with a 4 foot long USB3 cable. It has a 2 year warranty. The retail packaging protects the drive very well, so even if the retail package is shipped poorly, the drive should arrive OK. It’s obvious that thought went into the design and user criticisms on the older models have been taken seriously by the company.Choosing an external drive in the 1TB and up range depends a lot your purpose for it. If you have a light laptop with a small fast internal drive (SSD), need something to hold your data with more capacity than a USB stick, and intend to take it with you everywhere -- consider a smaller capacity, 2.5 inch portable drive that runs power & data over a single cable. The MyBook, seems ideal for less-portable use to: back-up a computer while at home, backup a server and then move the data off-site for safety, attach more storage to your entertainment system, attach a drive to the USB port on your advanced router to make a pseudo-NAS, backup a mirrored two-disk Buffalo LinkStation nightly via the USB port, add storage to your server via USB when all the SATA ports are taken, use it for Time Machine on a Mac.Which connection is best? The common options in external drives include: USB2, USB3, eSATA, and firewire. USB 2.0 maxes out at 60 MByte/sec using “High-Speed”. USB 3.0 maxes out at 625 MB/sec (about 5Gb/s) using “Super-Speed” and can pass SMART data.  My testing of the WD10EUCX disk hooked directly via SATA gets about 93MB/sec average transfer rate (HD Tune). That becomes the limiting factor if you have USB3. With USB3and the drive inside the My Book enclosure I get about 90 MB/sec average transfer rate -- so USB3 works pretty well. (Same test with USB2 got me 33 MB/sec.) All the 1Tb USB3-only externals were comparable in price when I looked today, and were only slightly more expensive than the cheapest, bare 1Tb internal drive. In this particular case, the same-type bare drive on newegg today was actually slightly more expensive. The next option is eSATA. It’s similar in function to just hooking up the drive directly to the motherboard and appears to carry a premium of about $20 more than the USB3 drives – don’t know why. Firewire 800/IEEE1394b supports up to 400 MB/s and seems to carry a premium of about $50-$100 over just USB3.My take on the software is in the Other Thoughts section."," Depending on your purpose, top speed may be an issue. It appears this product is designed for energy efficiency (it is a green drive), and to be durable/reliable/cool/easy to use as backup. The speed is sufficient to stream video, stream FLAC audio, and backup a desktop while you are sleeping. It is not designed to be the fastest for copying thousands of small files in the shortest possible time."," OS compatability & provided software: I tried this on XP, Win7, Mac laptop, Linux, FreeBSD, and a couple network appliances.The drive comes formatted as NTFS (the older models came as fat32) with an MBR partition scheme. If you plan on storing files greater than 4 Gb in size, keep it as NTFS on Win. The driver automatically installed for me on Win 7. If you are using mac you’ll want to reformat with HFS+. To do this you’ll either need to use the provided software or to do it manually you need to go to Partition Map, hit the Options button and change the boot record scheme to GUID from MBR (if you don’t, Disk Utility may give you an error message that says there was an unknown error with the partition map). I’ve also tested formatting this drive on Linux as XFS and EXT3. I’ve tested that it can be used as a backup disk with a Buffalo Linkstation RAID1 NAS on the USB port. I’ve tested that this disk mounts on FreeNAS 8.3.0-RC1 with two different ASUS AMD mbs with USB2. This gives you a fast option to move data in/out of a redundant FreeNAS server without using network bandwidth. I’ve also tried the drive on a Netgear 3500L router flashed with Tomato as an inexpensive pseudo-NAS/BitTorrent storage.The optional software experience is similar in look and feel on both Windows and Mac. There is a “WD Quick Formatter” with Win/Mac versions. There is a suite of management/diagnostics/computer backup/driver software called “Smartware” that lets you install only the parts you need. For Mac there is an optional “WD + turbo” driver that improves the file transfer speeds (about 10%) and a backup option that is more granular than Time Machine. If you plan on using the drive as a “usually-connected and on” drive it will keep your data automatically backed up with file versioning with a reversion count of up to 25.  There is an interesting display that graphically categorizes the files by type and shows you what has been backed up. The software allows you to set Drive Sleep/Password Protection/Run SMART tests.I have had five of the older 1 Tb USB2 drives for a long time and they are still working fine.  I use two of them for nightly automatic backup images of a couple of RAID1 NAS devices in always-connected mode. I use the other two to store laptop backups, rotating one unit off-site. The fifth is my general purpose portable utility drive that goes in the suitcase when I travel. I’ve used it to offload my parent’s data when upgrading their computer; I’ve used it to carry around a portable version of my LightRoom catalog.  I’ve had good luck with the 1 Tb Green drives as internal disks for data storage (not system drives) in desktops. Backup and redundancy are not optional if you value your data. Drives fail. A high-capacity portable drive with a separate power supply is often a good component in a comprehensive backup strategy.",2,2

Just Remember to Change the Sleep Timer,4, Lots of space.No hardware encryption like the WD My Book., Parks the head every 8 seconds which could rack up a high LCC in no time.  Bad for the drive but fixable.  See below.," CrystalDiskInfo tells me that the drive inside is an WD40EZRX which is a Caviar Green.  Why should I care?  Well, in case you don't know, Green drives park their heads every 8 seconds to save power.  That would be fine, except that it also increases the LCC (Load Cycle Count).  Green drives are rated for 300,000 LCCs.  As to what happens after that, your guess is as good as mines.If you have your drive running for 2 hours a day it will rack up 900 LCCs.  At that rate, you will reach the 300,000 limit in just over 11 months.  Do the math yourself.Q.  So what can I do about it?  Simple.A.  Change the sleep timer to a higher setting.Q.  How do I change the sleep timer?A.  If you google around, you will see that some people use a WD utility called wdidle3.  However, that means removing the drive from the enclosure which in turn voids your warranty.Q.  So how the heck do I change it?A.  Go to WD and search for a program called WD Smartware.  Download and install it.  You can try the program for 30 days but you really only need it for a few minutes at the most.  Connect your WD Elements (still in the enclosure) and start Smartware as an Administrator.  Go to Settings-->Sleep Timer and change the setting to suit.  I think 10 or 15 minutes is best.  Waala!  Problem solved!  You can uninstall WD Smartware now.Ubuntu users don't have to install anything.  Just connect your WD Elements then execute the following command in the terminal...sudo hdparm -S<number> /dev/sdxCareful!  The ""S"" parameter (as in -S<number>) is uppercase.<number> is a number between 8 and 12 (i.e. 8 to 12 seconds) or 30 and 300 (i.e. 15 to 150 minutes in increments of 30 seconds).sdx is your WD Element drive, e.g. sdb, sdc, etc.There are other ways to change the timer, but the two above are the easiest, IMHO.I did a lot of research on this issue before buying this drive.

In the course of that time over USB 3.0 all that was copied was a grand total of 5gb's even over USB 1.0 it would have been far more. So, I sat and watched the copying for a minute. The transfer started at a nice decent pace albeit not what is advertised by any means. For about 5 mins after started I was seeing 150 mbps transfer speed which after the initial 5 mins would drop down to around 20-50 mbps finally teetering between 5 mbps to 25 mbps. At this point I ran some diagnostics and found tons of bad sectors on the drive. So, I ran defrag on all drives and cleaned up any junk I may have had and tried it all over. Again started strong then the fun stuff happened, random disconnects during transfer at about 1-3 per half hour or so as well as the awful speeds.

About 6 months later (20 backups - I keep count), these drives (I have two of them) stopped being recognized at all.  One of them would sometimes be recognized as a USB device, but never showed as a drive in the system.  These were my backup drives - fortunately I also have two large Seagate external drives which are (so far...) working fine.   WinDLG couldn't see the drives on USB.Finally fed up, I opened one of the units and found that the drive itself is a WD Green.  I pulled the drive from one and found a discolored area on both the drive PC board and the mating controller/USB board - in areas that are next to each other with a thin insulator sheet.  Looked like way too much heat and perhaps a bit of smoke.  I'd post photos if I could.  I then removed the USB/controller board and hooked the drive to a USB dock that works well with other drives.  Tested with WinDLG and found ""unknown errors"" on the short test, and ""failure due to electrical errors"" on the long test.  I could only conclude the drive was smoked or overheated & burned something up using the supplied WD power supply.Not encouraged, I then opened the second non-working drive.  This one showed very similar heat discoloration and black ""soot"" on the same boards in the same place as the first drive.  Unlike the first drive, however, when placed in the USB dock and tested with WinDLG the drive actually ran the tests and showed numerous bad sectors.Further inspection of the electrically-failed drive and the USB/controller board show some blackened pitting that appears to be arcing.  This would indicate that the insulating material does not do it's job & there's some kind of design failure by WD on these drives.  It's not the USB connector - it's in the vicinity of the activity LED.Two DOA drives bought a bit of time apart.  Both now dead.  At this point, I may be able to recover one of the ""green"" drives from inside - but the total cost is much higher than if I'd simply bought the bare drive and an external dock in the first place."," I've now got a pile of bad WD drives, including a WD Red that lasted less than 6 months in my NAS.  Four dead RE4's, one good RE4.  Three good (so far) Red drives.  One dead Green drive (this one), and one that may be recoverable but I won't trust it again.  And a couple of others of various types and vintages.  One of the RE4s was a factory refurb to start with, never again for that.For what I've put into drives, these are no bargains.

First, the physical aspects: The rive runs incredibly cool - slightly above room temperature. Second, it is silent. Much quieter than my previous generation of Western Digital hard drives, which I have never had a problem with. Finally, it is aesthetically pleasing, and matches either a PC or an Apple computer well. The glossy, piano-black finish is beautiful, and the activity light minimalist yet proportional. Now, onto performance. The drive uses a single USB 3.0 port that is downward compatible with 2.0 and 1.1 (cable included). I'm currently using USB 2.0, and it is outperforming  my previous USB 2.0 external hard drive. It comes formatted as NTFS, and within seconds I reformatted to HFS+ for my Macbook Pro. The WD software bundle is not invasive, and does not install automatically. By formatting the drive you erase it. This is helpful considering that it adds little functionality."," I can't think of a single problem. The price was appropriate and the build quality excellent. There are no studies showing which hard drive company is more reliable, but my experience may be admitted as anecdotal evidence - I have had excellent luck with WD hard drives, only one out of five in the past 10 years have failed.

Now I can't get anything off it. The drive was only a few months old, but despite being new it died without warning. What's the point of backing things up if the backup does not work? What a waste of time and money!The storage device was given to me as a gift, but Toshiba refused to honor its 3 year warranty because I could not give them the receipt due to the fact that I never had one. Fortunately I am backed up to the cloud.The oldest review I could find on Toshiba's website was January 2013, meaning the entire line of Canvio 3TB drives are at most 2 years old. I explained that in any universe my drive would still fall under the three year warranty because this drive's very existence is under three years old. Toshiba insisted that without a receipt they would not provide warranty for the product. So beware: first, don't buy this drive, but if you are foolish enough to do so, hold on to your receipt, then be prepared to lose all of your data. At best they will simply send you a new drive that will certainly give you no confidence if you already lost your data once....assuming that you have any data left to lose after your first drive crashes.Toshiba Corporation is attempting to survive in the hard drive storage marketplace against strong competitors. My advice: buy any of those other drives instead.When checked today, even the Toshiba website shows this drive gets 1.5 stars out of 5 by consumers. Even they know the drive stinks. No wonder they do not want to replace it under warranty.I explained to Toshiba that if they do not honor their warranty, my only remedy as a consumer versus a big corporation is to post this warning everywhere I see their drive for sale.

The controller will simply power off the  drive in the middle of a long copy operation. The drive then immediately wakes back up and repopulates itself to the OS (autorun prompt etc), and the copy op must be restarted. This requires one to break up large multi-hundred-GB ops into small chunks and baby-sit the drive to make sure they copy through successfully.

The device would constantly connect and drop connection to the PC. Then the really bad news, I got the HDD drive needs to be formatted error. Knowing I would likely lose my data if I formatted, I opted not to format. I called in to Toshiba and they told me that they would send me a coupon to replace the defective part. Great, but what about my data? They told me to take it to Best Buy for data recovery. I took it to Best Buy and they told me it would be $100 to recover the data. Mind you, this is something I could do myself, for free, but if I remove the drive from it's casing, then I void my warranty. I called Toshiba back and they told me that my hands are tied, as they do no data recovery and all they do is trash the drive upon receiving it. They went on to add that the warranty states that Toshiba is not responsible for the loss of data on a faulty device(naturally). Basically, I have to spend $100 extra or lose my data, all for my only fault being that I bought a defective drive.Thanks Toshiba!"," The drive had the potential to be a good drive, but was ruined by faulty parts and bad design.

It comes with its own NTI backup software. It backed up 12.09GB of mixed data in 4min57sec. There is no file compression option. The backup software is easy to setup & use. I use different backup software so all the backups use the same software & I have more options.Even after large data transfers, the drive case is only a little warm."," Due to problems when this drive is connected, I only connect it when I need to add or recovers something from it.I’ve had several system crashes & reboots when the computer is doing time consuming tasks, with the Windows warning that there was a possible hardware problem. These problems stopped as soon as I disconnected the Toshiba from my computer. I’m using XP SP3 with HDD set to never power down, & Toshiba lists this drive as compatible with XP. The Toshiba drive keeps what I guess is a powering down problem, because the system lists it, then when it tries to access it, its unavailable, then I hear it spinning up, the system finds “new hardware” then it’s usually back to work, but a couple times I’ve had to disconnect the USB cable & reconnect it to get the system to see it again. I’ve switched USB cables from another working HDD and the problem remains with the Toshiba. No problems with the other USB drive using the Toshiba’s USB cable. I was copying recovered files from a failing HDD to it, but when the recovery program spent too long trying to piece together a good copy of large files, the Toshiba drive had done its disappearing act & I had to start over several times because the recovered data had nowhere to be copied to. This cost me hours of extra work & time."," I have a lot of data backed up to the drive and it all checks out as being OK so far, but the hide and go seek game the Toshiba drive does doesn’t inspire confidence, especially in a large data restore. Also I get the frequent warnings that MFT (Master File Date) data was not written. So far this has not caused a problem because there were no significant changes to the MFT, but it is still worrisome. I’ve 4 other brands of external HDD’s and none of them act like this.Since this drive has its own hardware to overcome the 2.2GB barrier, I worry about what other things like disobeying the drive shutdown rules it ignores.",3,3

But I found a picture of one on E b ay that was pulled from the case. The sticker said both Toshiba and Hitachi on it. It is made in China by Hitachi Global. This gave another number of DT01ABA300.

It says that the Toshiba DT01ABA hard drives sport Serial ATA 6Gb/s interface, 32MB cache and 1TB platters. I wanted 1TB platters! I was after this drive because it only uses 3 platters and it spins at 5940 RPM! Most other drives use 4 and 5 platters which is more moving parts. This is what I wanted for lower heat in an external enclosure. It is pointless having a 7200 rpm drive running hot in a fanless enclosure, at least in my opinion.  When it runs all day, it only hits 37-40 deg C. or around 100 deg F in my 70 deg room. Seagate only makes 7200 rpm drives now so they run hotter especially in an enclosure. This enclosure does spin down the HD after about 10 minutes so if you want to prevent this, just download a nice little utility called NoSleepHD v2.0. It will handle up to 5 HD's. I set it to write file every 5 minutes. You can also hide the program in the system tray and autorun on startup. Ever since Seagate bought samsung HD's out, I thought I'd try this newer technology drive. It's been a month now. So far so good. I am not necessarily an Hitachi fan, but it looks like they are now leaders in the latest technology especially since The FTC ordered Western Digital to  handover their 3.5-inch HDD Manufacturing to Toshiba because of Monopoly concerns.

I use this device for all my backup needs and it works great with the 3.0 USB connectivity.

I prefer a power adapter which doesn't directly plug into the power outlet, using a lot of space."," The case is is made of thick plastic with air vents to prevent overheating.  Many other large external drives don't have vents in their cases, which is a bad design unless you're Mr. Freeze.  This unit transfers files about 3x faster than USB2, which is what you should expect from any USB3 drive.  USB3 is almost mandatory for use with a DVR, since it needs to simultaneously transfer data in both directions, which USB2 cannot do.  To use this (or any large drive) with XP, reformat it into multiple partitions smaller than 2.2TB each.  Don't be fooled into believing everything is alright just because Windows seems to work when you plug it in.  Windows will screw up (totally) if you don't reformat.  You've been warned!

I went to Toshiba's site to read what was there. Very limited info. No mention of sleep or intelligent power mode. I can not tolerate having my system hang while I wait for a drive to spin up. Had I seen that mentioned in the info available I never would have purchased it. I did a very rough analysis of large capacity HD power consumption in operation vs in idle. The numbers I crunched showed it would cost less than 50 cents per month to have the thing always spinning with most of its time in idle. A cost I'm willing to bear. It is not suitable for the job I need it for. So this drive will spend all of its time unplugged and useless.I've looked for a solution. Toshiba's tech support has not been helpful. I'm aware of programs that write a zero file to a disk at intervals to prevent sleep. If I can find no other answere I may try that. NewEgg didn't make this drive so I do not fault them. NewEgg is the Best. Toshiba has disappointed me.,3,12

My unit arrived with minor cosmetic blemishes on the glossy sides of the plastic enclosure (a little car cleaner wax is all it took to clean that up to like-new appearance.)  My guess is that a large production run of these drives was manufactured with the cosmetic blemishes and/or the slightly misaligned connector ports which is why they have been ""recertified"".  Otherwise, this WD external drive is like new and is a great bargain for 1TB of high-quality storage.",None,None

Took it apart and found out that the circuit board between the usb and sata had a minor blemish in the design. So I put in the system as a internal drive.

ONLY 931 GB!? (See other thoughts)," * WHAT! ONLY 931BG!1024kb is true 1 MB. 1000kb is also true 1 MB (to HDD manufactures). So, it's kinda misleading in a way, but not really.I am consolidating 2 external 500GB drives (Seagate and Maxtor) into this one drive.If everything was to left on as is (all USB), this process would take a very long time to complete.So, I open the case using a guitar pick, from the bottom of the drive, remove the USB contoller (one screw) then connect to SATA on PC. Sustained 30MB/s from USB to SATA vs. USB to USB 10-12MB/s.* Power and USB ports not align correctly - There is 1 L bracket that hold the controller to the SATA interface on the drive. If you take a chance and open the case you can straighten the bracket to align with the holes on the case. Reman tech needs to take a little more pride in there work.

Task manager performance showed seek time as high as 4199ms and 100% drive use during the lowest amounts of data transfer...made no sense.-current review, was able to get drive to stay A LOT MORE STABLE. I suspect the position of the drive plug in on the sata port of mother board is CRUCIAL in speed transfer. Currently using this drive in a plug directly under the next drive and there are two more drives plugged in this manner right next to those two.

My Samsung drive is my biggest worry, makes loud single click upon boot every time since day one and runs a tid bit on the not so quiet side. Reduced that problem by not allowing the hard drives to sleep when pc is in idle, so only click is heard at boot, pretty loud. Kinda like a finger snap in volume.

No problem there.Anyone who has a number of assorted external drives appreciates the option to stand them vertically rather than to have them lying flat; this model has no such provision (i.e., rubber feet).It would have been nice to have more than one connector port - the only one of which is on the same end panel as the power input and the indicator light.

The only consistent thing about this drive is how inconsistently it performs. It can't even benchmark consistently within reason.- High Failure Rates. Mine died just sitting on a huge desk that doesn't move or endure any shocks. The drive never moved once installed and still killed itself within 2 months.- Substandard RMA service now. TERRIBLE! Warranty replacement for RMA products. Why should I get a recertified drive when I bought a NEW drive that's less than 2 months old? Why should I get a replacement drive that could potentially only have a 90 day warranty if you're at the end of your original warranty? Does Seagate not trust their recertification program or their products in general? Seems not.," Make no mistake, ever since drives went beyond 2 TBs in size the quality across ALL manufactures has tanked and I imagine it has to do with the technical limitations of the medium right now so there's so much less room for error.So I think NOW more than ever, it's important to have a company that stands behind their products and warranty and unfortunately, Seagate doesn't. Western Digital isn't any better since they have virtually the exact same policies; so it's a sad reality you have to deal with if buying a high capacity HDD these days.I won't say avoid Seagate or WD if you need a high capacity drive, just get it at the absolute cheapest you can because no matter what you pay, Seagate and WD will treat you like a second rate, bottom of the barrel customer should their product fail.

The light dims in and out slowly to indicate activity, it does not flicker like most external drives do.- The drive can only be put on the table flat, not on it's side if you want to safe real estate on your desk"," Newegg delivered the brown box promptly for this EggXpert review as always.The drive came in full retail box packaging which includes the external drive, USB cable and power adapter, it also has a quick installation guide that takes you through the setup steps.The drive has a shiny appearance on the top as it lays flat, matte black on the four sides and light blue on the bottom with four little stands.

Drive Info: Seagate ST5000DM000-1FK178Drive Firmware: CC44Spindle Speed: 5900 RPM.Disclaimer: These benchmarks were done with little data written to the hard drive, so these are pretty much the best speeds you will achieve out of this hard drive, as the drive gets more and more full, transfers speeds will decrease, as the head of the drive reaches the center of the platter each rotation covers less and less data."," No Off switch, have to pull the power if you want to turn it off you have to pull the power cable.  The case is plastic, not a big deal, I am just preferential to metal cases.  The product registration (built into the software on the drive) asks for a lot of information, some of which is what your work title is, your salary, your business sector, etc.  These questions seem rather unnecessary and you can opt out of answering them if you choose like I did."," Remember a 5TB drive is actually 4.54 TB (Marketing says there are 1000 bytes in one Kilobyte), however computers read them correctly at 1024 bytes per Kilobyte, which is why the space in lower than advertised.

I already had a 2TB drive for my wife to backup pictures, videos, and architecture REVIT files.  The USB 3.0 is very fast and moving about 30GB worth of pictures and movies only took a few minutes.Install is seamless.  Windows 7 recognized the drive immediately and it was up and running and I was able to transfer files.The apps for both Apple iPhone and Android devices (in this case my wife's Samsung Galaxy S3) work well.  Though only one device can be backed up at a time.  Starting the app on another device will kick the original device that was backing up.  Now that we have the apps installed the backup runs in the background and we don't even notice."," The software that comes with the drive could use a bit more work.  I started the software (it comes saved on the hard drive) and it asked me to register the drive.  Easy enough...so I did that.  Then there was an updated version of the software I could download.  The install failed at first but after restarting the computer the install continued and completed successfully.  The software does NOT make a complete backup of your computer's hard drive.  In the event of having to restore your hard drive due to an operating system failure the drive will be of no use.  You won't lose your files, true, but you had better be ready to do a fresh install of your OS.  I could be wrong on this but was unable to locate any program files in the backup folder that the software created.The power plug.  It seems like any device that requires a wall power receptacle ALWAYS gets this mentioned as a negative from me.  I know it's kind of petty...but why...WHY can we put a tank on another PLANET that sends back complex scientific data on soil composition and atmospheric readings but we can't create a power adapter that takes up only one plug on a power surge strip?  Just like my router, my modem, my other two backup drives, and even the charger for a couple of my wife and my mobile devices this device has an awkward annoying oblong brick that takes up one and a half outlets on the power strip.  I had to rearrange several plugs and cords so that this thing was on the bottom of the strip.  Again this is minor...but I consider it a con and I will continue to mention it in my reviews.  There HAS to be a better way!", This is a great device.  I'm sure with third-party backup software this thing would be a BEAST of a backup drive.  5TB is massive and for the size the drive itself is quite small and able to be hidden.

Then i used the backup software that came with the unit and did a full backup of my raid array which consists of 2 240Gb ssd's. Which took less than 5 minutes to complete. Future updates to the back up file take a small matter of seconds to do. There is no noise vibration or heat that come from the unit at all. Its is very well built although a bit large, it can take up valuable desk top space if your limited on it. Overall I am very happy with this product and would highly recommend it to friends and family that were looking for a large easy to use back up solution."," My only con is as others have said no way to turn it off other than pulling the power plug, in my honest opinion this is an over-site on Seagates part but it would not deter me from giving it 5 Eggs and my recommendation to anyone asking about storage/backup options.", This is a great product for anyone wanting a good safe convenient option for backup and storage. I would like to see it come in a smaller form factor drive like there 2.5 inch drives. Not sure if the 5TB keeps it from being possible but with today's technology if its not it soon will be.  So with all that said if your looking for massive size storage and/or backup solutions dont hesitate and check this drive out. Its been a real pleasure to play with and the software is so easy to use your computer illiterate grand parents can easily master it.,1,2
N82E16822178501,22-178-501,8/9/2014 9:38:57 PM,Andrew K.,Excellent external HDD,5," All included components are well made. The USB cable is tough but flexible and the connectors are strong and secure. The power adapter cable is much the same as the USB cable, the adapter itself is made of rigid plastic and doesn’t feel cheap like most do. The actual enclosure is made of firm plastic that doesn’t have any give. The ports on the enclosure are very secure ensuring a solid connection. The enclosure does not have an internal fan, it does however have an elevated base with ventilation holes and ventilation holes in the rear (the dimples on the side are purely aesthetic).The drive runs cool and quiet even with sustained operation.Set up was extremely quick and easy. The included instructions perfectly depict the set up process. The inclusion of the Seagate Dashboard installer on the drive ensures correct order of operations when setting the drive up, and makes registering the product with Seagate even easier than it would be otherwise.The real star behind this drive is the Seagate Dashboard software. It has a pleasant aesthetic and a simple yet functional layout which includes options such as logging, the ability to toggle the enclosure’s LEDs, check for updates to the Dashboard, and the ability to display or hide certain home screen options.The dashboard software has three backup operations (PC, Mobile, and Social Media). PC backups were what I spent most of my time testing. First, there doesn’t seem to be any unreasonable limit on the number of backup plans you can create (I got bored after creating about 35). Second is that creating a backup plan is extremely simple. You can choose to use the default plan which is just all the default options chosen (All non-system files on local drives, backed up to your Seagate external drive, continuously) or you can create a custom plan, which allows you to customize what files are backed up, and when. After a plan has been created it can be edited, run manually, or deleted, including all the data the plan backed up, if you choose.Restoring backed up data is as simple as clicking the large “Restore” button in the Dashboard. You’re then walked through a few screens similar to setting up a backup plan. You’re asked to choose which plan you wish to restore from, from when and what files you want to restore, and where you would like to restore them to.The mobile app called is called “Seagate Mobile Backup” and is seldom mentioned other than on the drive’s packaging. Despite this it works much the same as the Dashboard including its nice look and simple layout, although you can only have one backup plan to a drive and another to the cloud. You can choose to back up your typical media files, as well as things such as your contacts, call log, and messages. Restoring your data works the same as with the Dashboard except that it only restores the files to their default location."," The top of the enclosure is made of high gloss plastic, so be wary when handling it unless you like cleaning off finger prints.I’ve bought quite a few HDDs, and even a few external enclosures, but never a pre-assembled external HDD. The main thing I can tell you is that shipping HDDs is no joke. They’re fragile, and every single one I’ve ever bought has been separately packed and shipped cradled by some sort of packaging designed to absorb shock and crush. The packaging for this drive seemed rather unsubstantial, just some cardboard to hold the drive snugly in its box. No crush space, and nothing shock absorbing.The two year warranty on this drive is competitive in today’s market, but I think these warranties are inadequate. Not to mention the standard warranty is only for the drive, and not your data.Seagate bothered to include a couple things on the drive out of the box, including the dashboard installer, warranty information, and some miscellaneous hidden files. The dashboard software offers some helpful links, including one to the dashboard manual, but why not just include it on the drive? Not everybody has a reliable internet connection, and those that do would only be temporarily inconvenienced having to delete a single file off the drive.Despite how nice the Dashboard software is, after using it and reading over the documentation, I’m fairly certain there is no way to name your backup plans. This would have been a great feature to make organizing and recognizing your plans much easier, especially considering that there doesn’t appear to be a limit for the number of backup plans you can create.Another omission I found in the Dashboard software was the lack of a unified view of all of your backup plans at once, this would help to accomplish the same goals as above, and if both were implemented, would make managing your files significantly easier.I feel like I’m nitpicking at this point, but it would be nice if the Dashboard could report the total size of a particular backup plan.My final issue with the Dashboard software is that it doesn’t seem to offer anyway to manage your data other than deleting it. A setting to automatically compress or even delete old backup data would be very welcome. Furthermore, I find it strange that I’m not given the choice to be able to wipe my backup data, but keep my plan, or to manually delete certain backup points."," Drive is default formatted as NTFS with the name “Seagate Backup Plus Drive”. Windows reports a total size of 4.54TB with 692MB already in use.There are no controls on the drive at all. Not even a power switch. Fortunately though, in my testing I’ve seen no adverse effects from unplugging the drive, whether or not you ejected it from your OS first.This is going under Thoughts rather than Cons because it’s not Seagate’s fault. Despite getting a year of cloud (by Nero) storage for free with this drive, I was unable to test it because for the entire time I spent testing this drive initially, the cloud registration page was broken. Hopefully if you’re reading this, it’s been fixed.When using the Seagate Dashboard software for backups, it doesn’t compress or archive your files. It will store your files under “x:\ Seagate Dashboard 2.0\computer name\user name\Backup\random folder name\date and time of backup”. That might seem slightly confusing but if you just look under your drive and click around for a little bit, it should start to make sense. It’s a good thing to know in the event you ever have an issue with the Dashboard software.The following benchmarks were attained using CrystalDiskMark.My PC USB3.0: SeqRead: 162MB/s SeqWrite: 191MB/s RandRead 43MB/s RandWrite 114MB/sMy PC USB2.0: SeqRead: 33MB/s SeqWrite: 30MB/s RandRead 22MB/s RandWrite 30MB/sOld PC USB2.0: SeqRead: 36MB/s SeqWrite: 32MB/s RandRead 23MB/s RandWrite 32MB/sThe benchmarks show two things. First, that USB3.0 is going to yield the best performance. The second requires some explanation. There is a massive generation gap between my PC and the old PC I used. Despite this, the benchmarks attained were broadly the same. My conclusion is that your PC would have to be quite marginal before you saw a negative impact on performance.The following benchmarks were attained using a 10GB video file and the Windows copy command.My PC USB3.0: File transfer to drive: ~200MB/s, File transfer from drive: ~130MB/sMy PC USB2.0: File transfer to drive: ~35MB/s, File transfer from drive: ~31MB/sOld PC USB2.0: File transfer to drive: ~33MB/s, File transfer from drive: ~34MB/sThese benchmarks show broadly the same thing (even at nearly identical speeds!) as the CrystalDiskMark benchmarks, but nonetheless are more realistic.Overall, I like this drive. It’s well built, looks nice, works perfectly, and all the models are competitively priced. Everything I listed as a con was quite minor, and only included because Seagate has proven receptive to such critique. This exact model (5TB) is doubtlessly overkill for some people. No matter which model you choose, if you end up with more storage space than you need, it just ensures that you’re able to keep more versions of your backed up files. In the time I’ve used this drive, it’s worked perfectly, with no intervention needed by me after initial setup. I would recommend this series of external HDDs to anybody looking to kee",4,7
N82E16822178501,22-178-501,8/3/2014 1:48:53 PM,Anonymous,All around good,4," First, size. Obviously 5TB is tons of space, and the price-point here is pretty good. Unless you are looking at multi-disk solutions, this isn't a bad consumer-level unit if you want this much storage in one place.No horrible blue lights. Hallelujah the day has finally come!! I am sick of external drives and enclosures making my hardware look like I bought it in Las Vegas.I get speeds faster on this drive than any other external drive that I have. Obviously it is much faster than 2.0 drives, but even the other 3.0 drives that I have are not this fast. Your mileage may vary, since USB 3.0 speed will be dictated, among other things, by the source disk (i.e. copying from your C drive to this drive may be limited by the speed of that drive, your motherboard, etc.)Doesn't seem to get too hot, holds up under heavy / long file transfers. Fairly quiet.I don't go for special backup software that comes with a drive like this, but I did poke around on it and it seems pretty good. I remember when Zip drives/disks came with software... those were awful."," Plastic construction is not especially aesthetically pleasing. I don't care, but you might. It is a fingerprint magnet, and it doesn't radiate heat as well as aluminum or some other body. That's a minor issue.NO OFF BUTTON?? I do not enjoy pulling plugs on hardware. This is 2014, we really can afford a small button or switch. I know for some drives, it's often easy to bump the button -- that's certainly a fatal flaw. But it's equally annoying to have no button at all.eSATA would be nice, but that's wishful thinking. Also I hate my eSATA card (it's spastic) so maybe I don't care after all.Most of these types of objects (external drives, routers, switches, etc.) have vertical or horizontal stands (and some have mounting hardware). This can only go horizontal. That's not a problem for me, but it's a bit silly. It's a rectangle. How hard is it to throw in a few rubber feet or a plastic stand to hold it up? This would help if the unit does get hot -- considering some backup options include continuous 24/7 backups, I think that might help!Warranty is only 2 years. That's the kind of warranty you get at this level, but that really speaks to the general paradigm of buying entry-level systems, hardware, etc. Even when you go for a premium product like this, it will not necessarily last forever -- or even as long as you want. This is a general problem, but be aware that this is not a foolproof, industry-grade, high-volume hard drive. It is designed so that at least 95% of them last about 2 years. Not to last as long as possible. That's why it's affordable."," My reviews are consumer-oriented. As a ""Newegg EggXpert"" I am supposed to do my best to provide honest reviews that are informative and useful for potential customers. One problem with this is that Experts are asked to review the product soon after receiving it. While that makes sense from a review perspective, and that is the point of the program, you should all be very aware that none of the Expert reviewers can speak to the longevity of this device. (Really, not many people can, it's a relatively new product.)So, word of caution as always: If you want a product with hundreds of reviews from users who have had the product last years, you won't get top specs like 5TB or USB3.0. Maybe every single drive will last 20 years, maybe they will last 2 years + 1 day. Who knows?Also, not a pro or con, but keep in mind what this product is. It's an external / backup hard drive. It is not meant for heavy loads of reading and writing (i.e. you wouldn't run high-intensity programs from this drive). If you are doing professional video editing, for example, you would want internal drives (or a more professional, higher-grade unit).And yes, as others have noted, be aware that the advertised specs are ""maximum theoretically possible"" and not realistic. 5TB = 5 * 10^9 KB, not 5 * 2^30. The USB3.0 maximum speed could not possibly be achieved by a magnetic drive reading or writing.And I did not try out the ""facebook image backup"" part of the software. I'm not going to touch that one with a ten foot pole.",5,6
N82E16822178501,22-178-501,7/31/2014 12:18:36 AM,Christopher M.,SPACE TO SPARE,4," -Hello. I am technically inclined, but I like to take the approach of a person reading reviews that doesn’t understand all the “geek speak” and make it understandable for the person who doesn’t have the time or patience to study up on stuff. If that’s you, then this one is for you.-Some people may argue that the “PC” version (both are the same) is $10 cheaper. However, if you take a look at the STBV5000100 (“PC” version) there is ZERO ventilation on the external casing. PLUS the PC/Mac version (this drive) has a cool looking bottom DESIGNED for superior ventilation. Although there is NO internal fan, at least the heat can dissipate much, much easier. The case itself has vent holes on all sides accept the top and front face.-Can be taken apart to be used as an internal HDD (Hard Disk Drive).-One thing I DID like was there was no blinking lights on it which is annoying when in the dark sittin on the bed watching a movie. Good job Seagate.."," -2 year warranty? Really? That is sad.-The bottom (blue) side looks like alloy aluminum in the pictures. It is not. It is an ugly muddy blue color. But I don’t care. I just thought if it WERE aluminum, it would act as a radiator of sorts to help dissipate heat. But it does not. Just plastic. However the plastic is not too thick and actually stays pretty darned cool to the touch; even after running it hard copying mass data to it for over an hour straight!-There is no on or off button. You must unplug it to quit using the drive.--Note to MAC users: This drive is USB 3.0 only. There is NO Thunderbolt connection. Not really a con for me since I am a PC user.."," -At the time of this writing, there were only 2 Newegg reviews, and both were one egg; due to the drive not being able to be left plugged in on reboots and running all the time, even when the computer was off. I however did not encounter either of these problem. I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit edition.-The first thing I did after testing as an external HDD was take it out of the external enclosure and run/test as an internal HDD. Copying 500 GB of movies, my transfer speeds averaged about 105 MB/s compared to 70-90MB/s (MB/s = Mega Bytes per Second) as an external USB 3.0 device. I was copying from a Western Digital 1 TB Blue 7200 rpm 32MB cache HDD. The main reason I made the drive an internal drive was to keep my system streamlined.-I use a program called Hard Disk Sentinal to monitor all my drives, and this drive shows up as flawless and perfect on first boot after converting the drive to a GPT drive after Windows installed drivers for the drive. I converted the drive to the more advantageous format to get the full 5TB out of the drive, where as if I used the standard format of Dynamic Disk, it would have been divided into 3 “partitions” of 2TB, 2TB, 1TB (approx.). After the cost of “overhead” for the drive to simply operate, you will be left with 4.54GB of useable drive space.-Large volumes such as this drive are for storage, not a ton of read and writes. Get a 750 MB or 1 TB drive for those needs. Because when you start zipping and unzipping and deleting and moving and copying, you’re just putting miles on the drive; and to loose 5TB of data because you thrashed the drive too much, well THAT is a tragedy. I have a 3TB that I store nothing but games on, and with the addition of this drive to my system it can stay dedicated as such. This new 5TB will house all my movies, music and other important archive items. With the addition of this drive, I am pretty sure I am done buying storage drives for quite a while.-Also I didn’t even try the software that comes preloaded on the drive. I have used it before and I don’t really need all the features if comes with (social and media sites backups). I use a 3rd party program called Acronis True Image for all my backup needs.-And if you ARE just using this as a system only backup device instead of storage, the USB 3.0 connection is fast enough for anyone to do an external backup solution.-Just because this is a review, please don’t take my words lightly and think I just favor a product because it is sent to me. I have a job to do; and that’s to be fair and honest about the product for future prospective buyers. I am just like you, a Newegg customer. And to me, Newegg reviews are golden. So I am not about to tarnish Newegg reviews OR my good name by telling you something is good when it is not. I hope this review has satisfied your purchasing inquiry needs. Thank you for reading. And thank you Newegg for allowing me another great opportunity to review.",7,11
N82E16822178501,22-178-501,7/30/2014 2:33:51 PM,Kenneth R.,Massive storage space at a good price,5," The first thing I did when I unpacked this drive was connect it to my USB 3.0 port and run Seagate diagnostics.  The box was pretty beat up, but the hard drive passed with no errors.  Drive has ventilation holes on the bottom and the sides.  The case barely gets warm so heat should not be an issue.  Like the USB cord length.  That was my complaint with some of the other USB drives I purchased.  I have 2 USB drives that I can only set on top of the tower because the cords are short.  The cord with the Seagate is of adequate length to locate the backup drive next to my monitor a few feet from the tower.Connected the drive and did not expect it to be fast - typically the hard drives I have purchased for USB 3.0 interface have been decent but nothing to brag about.  This drive performed respectfully well.  I achieved 118MB/s read and 85MB/s Write.  For actual file transfer, I copied a 3Gb file from internal hard drive and the avg transfer rate was 78MB/s.  The transfer rate from one internal drive to another was about 81MBs.  When transferring a large amount of file (38,000 files in 8 folders) the task completed in 7 min 29 seconds -- about 16 seconds longer than disk to disk.I installed the Seagate Console and started a backup.  I have two drives, a 300gb WD Velociraptor and 750gb WD Black.  I selected full backup of all drives continuously. A full backup ran for a little over 7 hours.  The nice thing about the continuous backup option is Seagate automatically backs up files that are modified.   All files on the backup drive can then be restored to the latest version.  If you ever have a drive failure, it is nice to know that you won't lose any files that were recently modified.There are other features like backing up mobile devices that I have not yet tried.  Nice feature if I can get it to work with my Android devices. Drive is quiet.  I cannot hear it and even when reading or writing to the drive I do not notice any noise coming from the drive.", No cons.  The only thing I can say is this is a little bulky in size and heavy - but it can be expected considering the storage capacity and performance.," For the price, this is a massive amount of storage for backing up your files.  As long as you have a USB 3.0 port available, the performance is more than adequate.  It's not the fastest drive, but for a USB drive, it performs better than many of the 5400 or 5900rpm drives used in network storage.  It will take a long time to use up all the space on this drive.  I backed up my entire system plus all my shared folders on my server and have only used 10% of the capacity.  For backup, this is set it and forget it.  No worries about data loss,",1,3
N82E16822178501,22-178-501,7/30/2014 8:21:11 AM,Mark W.,Very Nice External Hard Drive,5," I have been using Seagate hard drives for years. They are fast, durable, quiet and fun. This 5TB external backup plus is fantastic. I backed up my desktop, my wife's desktop and her laptop. I used Seagate's software and it worked very well and quite fast. If you are looking for a 5TB external power house that is fast, quiet, and durable, then this is the drive for you.", None!," The Seagate softare is very nice.

Give the ability to save from mobile devices. 5TB of space.  Simple Backup plan(s)  Easy to use Dashboard to make it all work.I love the way it lays flat instead of vertical, I love how the LED light is toward the back of the drive and not the front and I love how you can shut it off if you want to. I love how it seems to be a lot cooler than other drives I’ve tested. All in all, I am impressed with how well this works.I normally don’t use these for backup drives because it’s a pain to manually move things to a drive and I never liked the software that came with other drives. This one however is simple enough that I’ve decided to leave it as a backup drive instead of my first thought of making it a DVR drive for my HTPC. I never went past half on my 3TB drive, so there really isn’t a need to go larger. If it wasn’t for the social media part of the software, I’d think this backup drive was no different than any other, but Seagate has made a very good impression with the dashboard software!"," It takes a few minutes for the dashboard to recognize the 5TB drive.  You’ll need to see Backup Plus Desktop 5TB and Cloud under storage devices before you can access a lot of the functions. Info, Manage, and Support will show up when you click the drive after it shows up. Manage is where you can turn off the LED light. Click the Home button to access the backup plans. It’s a good idea to select files so you can check or uncheck other drives and/or folders in your computer that you want or don’t want to backup! You have complete control once you learn where it is! At first I thought the software was buggy and flawed, but you just need to open it and give it a few minutes. Then it works like it’s supposed to. Keep in mind how many files a 5TB will hold and remember it’s not an SSD. It’s not going to be lightning fast, but it does just fine in comparison with other HDDs. It may take a few minutes to backup your mobile device as well. It doesn’t work in the background, so you’ll want to stick with it till your initial backup is complete. Then it’s just a matter of syncing the few photos you take here and there."," This is a great way to sync photos with flickr but I already had another method and over 30GB of photos. I’ll continue to use that method, but this would be a great feature for someone who is just starting out or has no other means of syncing their photos with flickr. I am glad to have it sync my facebook account though! You can disable whatever you don’t wish to use, one or two or all three. I’m not using YouTube now, but I think I’ll give it a go down the road!Don’t be fooled by ANY drives (USB 3.0 up to 4.8Gbps speeds) advertising.That is the possible bandwidth for USB 3.0. That does NOT mean the drive should transfer at near 600MBps. You will be sorely disappointed if you even think that for a second! You will need to read the rated speeds for ANY flash drive, SSD, or HDD and only aim to reach those speeds. A simple Update to your Chipset drivers may improve your speeds, but you can’t expect what the drive itself isn’t capable of doing. And some manufacturers don’t always share the max possible speeds of their drives. To me, this drive isn’t any faster than any other USB 3.0 HDD I’ve used. It’s on par with all the others. Capacity: 5,000,972,681,216 bytes  - 4.54TBPlease research how Hard Drives calculate their storage space before you think you were swindled out of almost half a TB of space! My first computer was custom built and had a 300MHz Celeron with an 8.4GB HDD and they’ve been calculating the HDD space the same since I started with computers way back then. You’ll notice your memory will show a little more, so let that make you feel better. You should really know this if you are going to put your knowledge down as 4 or 5 stars!",5,7

It plugs into the wall, therefore you unplug it FROM the wall to turn it off. What exactly is the problem there? Its fast! Its very fast considering its plugged into a USB 3 port. I backed up a nearly full 2tb hard drive in under 2 hours. Considering that the hard drive was filled with video and high resolution pictures, as well as game backups tells me that the data transfer is massive. It transferred roughly 80megs/sec.  I also backed up the other 4 hard drives on my computer to this hard drive, and it still has enough room for more stuff! 5Tb of disk space apparently goes a long way! I like how the external drive is formed. Its a low profile, and looks pretty good sitting on my desktop. Its not loud, it doesnt have annoying lights to distract anyone, and I can pretty much set it anywhere."," My only gripes is the fact it doesnt have an on/off switch (knocked an egg off for that), and it gets a bit warm. The enclosure isnt very effective at dissipating thermal energy. This external hard drive isnt meant for 24 hour operation. You can stand it on end, but I wouldnt keep it that way for very long; you could tip it over."," How about a power switch? Also, it could use a stand to mount it vertical.

Otherwise one might as well buy it cheap direct from China.,None,None

After checking the Asus site I found the problem there was a recent update for the usb driver. Transfer speed is dramatically faster now, as fast if not faster than some of my other regular sata drives."," Proprietary drive end connector, sorry I don't like thoseRuns a bit warm at idle. It runs in tolerance for a hard drive (has been increased throughout industry) but I am in the cooler is better club and it definitely factors into the lifespan of a drive, the case really should be better designed for better air circulation.Writing small chunks of data can be on the slow side for many drives, but seems even slower for this one. I use for photo and video storage primarily and photo transfer can be slow the files are usually around 25mb in size. Large video files go Much faster.Slow transfer of small chunks is not unique by any means to many hard drives and It's not a huge issue (for me anyway), just something to be aware of."," I don't know all the specifics on how data is stored on this but it is really designed just for storage, not for a main boot drive etc.That is why this particular drive is used as external storage drive.My main reason for buying this was the price, it was cheaper than a regular sata drive but with the added benefit of usb 3.0 interface that I can easily use with any drive.Also I have always had good luck with Seagate drives, have a couple over 10 years old that still run fine. I removed it from the case easily without destroying and put it in the bottom of my ATX Tower, since I really did just want it for permanent storage a non issue for me. It went from running idle in the low to mid 40c range to running in the low 30c range, even with heavy use stays cool. Maybe for some that defeats the purpose of an external drive (and of course voids that lovely 1 year warranty) but I can easily put it back in the case if I need to move it, or even hook it up to another computer easily enough with just the cable.Cheaper than buying an interface card. So overall a good drive I would have no problem recommending. And as with all my other Seagate drives I am sure it will develop no problems.",None,None

Many 1 star reviews for failures. Only lasted 3 months. Lost 3 1/2 TB of files.," ORIGINAL REVIEW 07-01-16:This drive worked good for about 3 months and then just died while transferring a file to it. When powering up, it would click twice, pause, click twice and shut down. Worked with it for about a week, powering it up and it shutting down, when finally my computer recognized it. I was able to use SeaTools for Windows on it and do the SMART test, which it failed. Did the Short DST and it passed. Did the Short Generic and it failed. Tried the longer tests and the drive locked up.I was able to transfer some files off of the drive, but now the drive is dead again and just clicks.I have had other Seagate drives with no problems, some over 10 years old that still work fine. This is the first Seagate to fail me. This drive seems to be a dud and would highly recommend staying away from it. UPDATE 07-06-16:Just got off the phone with Seagate support. I did the advance replacement where they ship the replacement drive to me first and then I return the bad drive using their packing material.

Why they didnt use the larger USB plug Ill never know - as the case has plenty of room for the standard USB plug"," I ended up with an RMA by going to Seagate support - this was before I noticed their reply to my review.I did a advanced RMA - which cost me about 13 USD for them to mail me a working drive, then I return old one in the box they ship me.I got a different model in return (sea gate back-up plus model) same 5tb space/usb3.0  new in box as replacement. Then I come and notice they replied to my Review with a code to enter on there website - but ""nowhere"" do I find a place that lets me enter that code - when I tried in couple places - it failed to work. So i don't see the point in there response if I cannot enter the code, to get the offered assistance from them. Seagate Response:Dear Edward,We apologize for the problems experienced with the USB plug on your 5TB Expansion Desktop and would like to talk with you to determine an available resolution. A support case (#05152108) has been created that will reference your review and our response.

Drive just clicks when plugged into the computer, cannot access the data at all.I've owned many LaCie and Western Digital external USB drives, never a problem with either brand. Seems like Seagate makes a junk product, which many of the reviews appear to back up. Guess I should have read the reviews in more detail, as looking back at them now, there do seem to be a number of fake positive reviews.And Seagate 'support' is an absolute joke; try another cable, plug it in again, etc., just stock scripts with no real personal 'support'. Plus, although the drive is still under warranty, they make you ship the piece of junk back to them on your own dime. SHADY. Instead, I'm spending more of my own money to purchase a hard drive enclosure to try and salvage the data from this hunk of garbage.I will never buy another Seagate product again, and heartily recommend that you do not either.", tl;dr - DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE!,10,13

N82E16822178742,22-178-742,9/13/2015 9:06:32 AM,Carl S.,Update,5, I have used this drive as a share drive hooked up to my router sharepoint. It has ran great and I found it becoming very slow in writing to the drive. I couldn't get the router to find it again. I thought it was the drive so I removed and reinserted it in the same place and then the router found it. It ran much better @140meg/sec but then started slowing down again and then router couldn't find it again.When I took the drive and hooked it up directly to my laptop it did great with no problems. What I found out was that USB 3.0 port on my router was bad. I check inside and found that the solder points in 2 place's were poorly done and had separated. I resoldered the points and tried it again with the drive connected. I has now worked great since., The cable can have been built poorly. The gauge of the wire for the power I believe is too small for drawing the correct current. I replaced the USB 3.0 cable to a heavy-duty one but didn't do any better. You must use the power supply transformer that comes with it to maintain the correct voltage and current., Overall not a bad drive.,2,5

I own several USB 3.0 external drives that I can plug in an run diagnostics on and get pretty consistent results. However, when I plugged in these new drives (I bought two), right out of the box they were giving me less than 1 MB/s write speeds, and maybe 3MB/s read speeds, give or take. Then I swapped out the power and USB cable from a different seagate drive and get a nice 160-180 MB/s both read and write. So I think the drives are ok, but the power/USB cables they provided are bad? I did try switching out the USB cable they sent, and got decent results (120 MB/s) so I think it is the power unit that is the likely culprit. It's too bad, because I was really excited about these, but with all the time I've had to waste trying to figure out what's wrong, I probably would have been better off going with a different product.",6,7

They charge you for shipping (which is almost crazy in 2015 especially when you spend more than $100)  3. The external hdd wasn't working from the get go  4. I have to pay shipping AGAIN to return and replace it," Let me start off by mentioning I already own one of these which I bought from a very popular online retailer (that I can't even type).  That experience was a lot smoother. It was faster and had free shipping.  It worked perfectly out of the box and haven't had an issue yet.  Now back to this one.  When I received the hdd from newegg on Wednesday I wasn't able to open it up or use it until Saturday because I am in the military and have very demanding hours.  Now to add to the intensity my modem broke and I had no internet for the weekend.  So I plugged in my hdd light turned on everything sounded fine it even started to download the driver.  So all seemed well until I opened up my computer double clicked on my Seagate (f:) and immediately my computer froze.  So I waited patiently for it to reload but it never did so I restarted my computer and decided to go into disk management and format, initialize disk, and assign it a drive letter but same thing my computer froze up. Third time is the charm (nope) I decided to go into command prompt and manually do it all so I was able then to format it but when it came time to initialize disk it wouldn't allow me. I forgot to mention that half of the times I plugged it in it wouldn't show up anywhere (not down on my toolbar, device manage, disk management, command prompt, etc.)  I might be missing something here but I know for sure that this hdd wasted my whole day away and still didn't work.  So I requested to replace it hopefully this next one that comes in works.  That was another bad experience in itself so I tried calling newegg and there customer service wasn't available so I had to do automated.  He would ask for an order # or phone # and I would type it in on my phone but somehow the guy would repeat the wrong number everytime and of course I didn't have internet at the time cause that would have been easier.",4,8

I’ve decided to put this one to use in two different ways. First, I’m migrating my little virtual machine “server” from Windows 7 to XenServer, and I have quite a few VMs to move. Second, after this, I’d like to move all of my pictures and music from my internal drive to this one. This tests both the large file transfer and multiple small file transfer (>100,000 files I think).The bulk file transfer went over very smoothly. My VMs and related files took up almost 2TB, with some VMs being as large as 20GB files. I can’t remember the exact transfer speed, but I feel like it was somewhere close to 200MB/s. It took between an hour and an hour and a half to get them all transferred. Overall, I was very satisfied, I feel like the transfer part took longer than the actual export process (into OVFs).Small/medium size files also went very well. Transfer rate isn’t as feasible of a measurement, but I transferred slightly under 1TB in total of various media files, including music, pictures, and videos. I had done this before with the Seagate portable drive, and this drive performed much quicker overall.The enclosure is also very well designed. I feel like there is not much extra space used up to cover the drive, maybe only slightly thicker. It also looks nice, though I bet it also serves for a practical purpose as well. There are indentations all over the enclosure, and I think they help cool the device (but I could also be completely wrong about this… at the very least, I think they look cool). It’s also very quiet, the drive vibrations don’t rattle the shelf or anything on top of it."," The LED is a little bright for my tastes, and you can’t turn it off. Also, the drive is occasionally slow to get out of standby mode when you don’t use it for a while. However, for the most part, I have very little to complain about this drive."," A great backup drive, highly recommended. I’ve been attempting to become more reliable with backups, so this will help a lot. Also, since this is not one of the terrible Seagate 3TB drives, I’m not worried about reliability. That doesn’t mean to not have a third option for your backups!",7,7

During reads, there is no noticable extra noise.  However it does make the traditional churning sounds while writing.  On the whole, this drive produces the typical amount of noise for most external HDD's -- it's no quieter or louder than usual.  However, given the capacity (5 TB), the noise is much more impressive."," The rubber mounts are placed along the width of the casing, so the drive stands vertically.  It seems like a strange way of positioning the case, since it can be easily knocked over.  Mounting hard drives vertically is perfectly safe, though.  Just make sure the enclosure is stored somewhere secure otherwise it could fall off your desk, shelf, etc, and break.  Storing the drive horizontally might work fine, but vibrations through the case could cause extra noise."," The included power adapter is about 5-feet long, the included USB cable is slightly shorter around 3-feet.

Marketing promotes the space as a base 10 value which is not a lie or misleading, but appears that way for those less educated in how a computer represents memory  (including harddrive) space.  For a computer it is base2.  So 2 to the 10th power is 1024 and that is what a computer uses to convert bytes to Kbytes to Mbytes to Gbytes to Tbytes.  So when a computer represents something in Kbytes it is divided by 1024 instead of base 10 dividing by 1000.  If you take the 5000000000000 and divide by 1024, you get 4882812500 Kbytes.  Divide it again by 1024 and you get 4768371 MBytes.  Divide it again by 1024 and you get 4656 GBytes.  Divide it again and you get 4.54 TBytes (suprise suprise suprise it is the value you are all quoting when you are stating it is short space).  So you are getting every last bytes that is listed in Base 10 it is just that your computer is showing it in Base 2.  Don't believe me, make you computer display your drive capacity in Bytes instead of TBytes and you will see.", See Pros for a quick lesson on capacity representation on a computer.

(will update review once I have a replacement drive and test for a few weeks to a month.," I have had good luck with Seagate products in the past, both internal & external. I saw this newer version of the Seagate Expansion 5TB become available and at a great price so decided to order though no review history was available. After initially testing the hard drive with Seagate Dashboard software as well as a quick Seatools diagnostic pass and having the drive pass, I connected the drive to my Synology Raid and configured it to backup 3.7TB of data. After starting the backup, it made it about 15% of the way through and then the blue light started flashing and it disconnected from the Synology, stalling the backup and forcing me to perform a hard disconnect of the device. I connected the drive to a machine and ran it through the same set of diagnostic tools which barely recognized the device and was never able to make it through testing again. The drive lasted a total of 2hrs before dying.Thanks to Newegg and their excellent staff, I have a replacement drive on the way and am hopeful this was a rare occurrence. I'll update my review once the new one is up and running for a short period of time.I'm always fearful of having a single massive drive to store files on (this is why I use RAID) and this experience proves the point. There is no substitute for having a good backup. This drive is to be used simply as a standalone backup for my Raid setup in case of catastrophe and I'm not too comfortable trusting the drive for this purpose based on my first experience. I will be performing a full multi-hour test on the next drive before putting it into regular service. If you plan on using any drive of this size and use it as your primary storage drive without backing up, you should purchase a data recovery plan to improve the likelihood of recovering your data in case of problems. In my case, I just need the drive to work and hold my backup data, so I purchased an extended warranty for 3 additional years of coverage which is well worth the small additional cost ($20).",23,28

Today it just started clicking like an old hard drive which has me worried. It has a total power on time of 12 days and 1 hour currently. Two days ago I unmounted the drive within Windows and removed the power plug. Come back to it 2 days later, plug it in and on spin-up and seek it's clicking.... Ran the Conveyance test and Short Self-Test through Hard Drive Sentinel Pro and everything checked out fine but a drive should NOT be clicking on spin-up this soon."," Fortunately I (I guess) I purchased two units (cheaper at the time to buy the external drives than the bare disks) just to remove and put in a NAS RAID unit for redundancy if one fails - I know these aren't NAS disks but I wanted to do it on a budget. Somewhat expecting a failure now. Wish I started using it sooner. It's interesting that the ST4000DM000 bare disks have a 2 year warranty period though, while this has a 1 year warranty period. Of course the warranty is void as soon as I remove them from the enclosure, but considering the clicking and already lapsed warranty period all the more reason to get them set up in RAID. Sticking with Western Digital or their HGST brand from now on.",1,1

This is when trouble started, when I plugged it in the external's hard drive indicator light flashes then stays solid. I wait and wait for something to pop up, I checked under hardware devices in windows and it doesn't see anything.  I ended out unplugging it physically from the power bar and usb cable too.  I plugged it back in again and was finally able to access this drive.  I thought it was maybe a fluke or something or I didn't have the USB cable in properly..ect.  So then I start my data backup after I checked to see if my files were ok (they were ok btw.)..next I proceded to copy a 4GB MPG4 video file and was about 20% through when the progress speed reduced down to 0 and then the progress window locked up completely and wouldn't go away or cancel.  I again ended up unplugging the drive and attempting copying a smaller file...worked ok til about 85% then it locked up again.  Frustrated I grabbed one of my smaller WD external 2TB drives and copied the files just fine no lockups.  I tested the seagate drive with their tools and said there was nothing wrong with it.  I have looked on line and other said try the bios update...so I took a long time to transfer all 3TB of video data off the drive to two other drives.(In case the hard drive bios update bricked the stupid thing.) I did the bios update...thing worked for a few weeks then started doing the same stupid thing.  I have a 2 year warranty on it but I need the data off it...so I tried backing up to two other externals I have and it locked up.  I believe from all I have read and my experience with other external enclosures is that the control on this enclosure is faulty or simply cheap bullpucky.  I plan to yank the drive out of the enclosure and backup the data once I put it in a known working hard drive enclosure.  All I have to say is Seagate get your ship together and make a better controller for these enclosures! ( the internal drive in the enclosure is good I am sure.)  WD went through the same thing a few years back before replacing all the controllers on their faulty enclosures...stand up and take responsibility for a poor product seagate!", I did buy this from Best buy as at the time Newegg was out of stock of these and I couldn't wait as I had a video project to finish that week.Buy a WD external drive they are better than this or the Samsung mini drive externals they are better quality than this!,None,None

9SIA3TB1HF6350,22-178-354,6/4/2015 11:22:31 PM,Kwon K.,Correction to my review below,3, See 'Other thoughts'., The rep I talked to flat out LIED to me.," It's been a few weeks since I bought this product. Before I started saving massive data to this, I decided to take this thing apart and confirm what the rep told me; that is, converting the expansion drive's partition to GPT makes the data that was transferred to the expansion drive recognizable by SATA.I thought this was an oversight on joeham's review, but nay. This baloney of a controller that's attached to the enclosure has a 'secret' as joeham mentioned that makes the data on the drive not recognizable by anything else, even if the partition is converted to GPT.When I extracted the hard drive from the enclosure and plugged it into SATA, the only thing the computer saw was a drive with only half of the space partitioned with nothing on it. I also tried attaching a 500GB hard drive to the expansion drive's enclosure, and alas, it couldn't read anything from it either.I had my doubts and I should've known better than to trust a customer rep. That's why I decided to see for myself, but the lying customer rep takes the cake. There's no chance of it being a mistake because I asked her multiple times to make sure and every time I did, she said it'd work.If you want to be able to retrieve your data when the controller dies (without having to pay for that ridiculously priced Seagate data recovery software or their service), DO NOT get this model. Get the latest model (STEB4000100) which does not have this problem. I'm still mad about the lying rep, but that doesn't really demean the quality of Seagate products.At least the warranty is only 1 year, so I don't feel like I lost much. Also, the included drive is a ST4000DM000, so getting and taking this apart is cheaper, especially if it's on flash sale (but of course you lose the warranty).",1,1
9SIA3TB1HF6350,22-178-354,5/22/2015 3:29:58 PM,Kwon K.,Good price. Adding to joeham's review.,5," - Good value; picked it up during a flash sale.- Can write at a rate of 120~150MB/s when transferring media files. Naturally, much slower if you're transferring a ton of small files.- Not too loud, though you will hear it; about as loud as a stock CPU heatsink running at the default RPM.- If you so desire, you can take out the hard drive from the enclosure and use it as an internal drive. The included drive is a ST4000DM000 as far as I'm aware, so you save money."," - Comes partitioned as MBR and uses a special controller to make it compatible with Windows XP 32bit; meaning if you use the expansion drive as it is, when you take out the drive and plug it into SATA, the computer won't be able to recognize what's already on the drive. See 'Other thoughts'. - None functionality wise so far; will update if the drive fails only within a few years."," Adding onto joeham's review down below (2 reviews before this), unlike the newest version of the expansion drives(STEB4000100) which comes partitioned as GPT to begin with (hence why the newest model doesn't work in Windows XP 32bit by default but you really shouldn't be using Windows XP anymore), the drive in this older model comes partitioned as MBR and uses a special controller to appear as 4TB for the sake of Windows XP 32bit's compatibility. To explain things a little for those unaware, a hard drive formatted as MBR can only utilize up to 2.2TB of its space, regardless of its original size. A hard drive formatted as GPT, however, can use 4TB as a whole. The downside is that GPT is only supported in Windows XP 64bit and later versions of OS. Seagate decided to partitioned the drive as MBR and installed a special controller to appear as 4TB to make this product work with Windows XP 32bit by default. Because of this, if you transfer data to the expansion drive, and later decide to take out the hard drive and plug it into SATA for whatever reason (i.e. broken controller), you won't be able to retrieve any data because the computer can't see the whole 4TB if the drive is MBR.I didn't know if the external drive will still work properly with the special controller if I convert the included hard drive to GPT. So, I called Seagate customer support to ask them and the rep said it's safe to do so, and people have done it before. I converted my drive inside my expansion drive to GPT with no problems and it seems to be working fine. Now that I've done this, if I take out the hard drive inside the enclosure and plug it into SATA, the computer should be able to recognize the data that's already on the hard drive.",None,None

9SIA3TB1HF6350,22-178-354,4/2/2015 5:51:13 PM,Anonymous,It works but there's a secret,3, Inexpensive 4TB drive compatible with XP thru Win 8.1.," There is a little secret you should know.  The internal format is secret.  The USB controller in this drive fakes the OS into thinking it is an NTFS drive with 4K sectors.  Traditionally drives under the 2.2TB limit use 512 byte sectors.  XP can read drives larger than 2TB if they are formatted as 4K sectors.  The Controller in this device presents the OS as such.If you have a failure of the cheap controller chip, you might think you can crack the case open and put the drive on a sata dock or put it internal to a desktop PC and recover the files.  But you will be wrong.  Windows will see the drive as an unformatted partition and two unallocated partition.  You can't read them because they have a secret format that only the controller chip knows.With a standard gpt or mbr formatted drive, you would have some hope of maybe using a disk data recovery program to get some of the data off the drive by putting it into a desktop or hooking it to a USB to Sata converter or a docking station.So if you loose the cheapo USB controller chip, or it screws up translation, say due to a power glitch, you loose your data.  Or you pay Seagate to recover it.  You can't read it with anything be another Seagate controller.I confirmed this by removing the internal drive.   I put it into a Plugable USB3-SATA-UASP1 and the drive shows up as three partitions and is unreadable in Win 7.  This is useless for a reliable backup device (unless you like trusting the USB controller chip).  I reformatted it as gpt drive and voila, now it is useable with normal sata controllers (internal desktop or sata docks).I believe a lot of reviews saying they have problems reading the disk or have lost data, are due to the translation of disk format by the USB controller, not actually a failed disk drive."," I would suggest for external drives over 2.2TB, avoiding the Toshiba, Seagate and other mfgr external drives if they advertise XP compatibility.  Most certainly there is some translation going on in the controller.  Instead buy a device that says it doesn't support drives over 2.2TB unless you use GPT.  This means not compatible with stock XP.  A good example of a device like this would be the Plugable USB3-SATA-UASP1.  This device uses GPT formatting and supports devices up to 6TB.  Also I have Mediasonic probox usb3 4 disk housings that support up to 4TB.  I can confirm that these work great with Win7 and 8.1 and you can remove the drives and put them into your desktop or swap them between units and the data is readable via the USB interfaces.The seagate drive is a good organ donor, because its cheaper to buy that a bare drive or similar size.  But depending on the controller IC adds another point of failure to the disk drive.  The last thing you want to add to your backup drive is a reduction in reliability due to a cheapo USB controller chip.",17,18
9SIA3TB1HF6350,22-178-354,3/25/2015 1:53:18 PM,Donald H.,Errors Galore,1, None, No internal fan.  Overheats quickly resulting in read/write errors. The included skinny data cable is under capacity.," I have 2 of these drives & both have read/write errors occurring anywhere from 1 to 15 minutes after connecting.  I tried a test where I replaced the supplied skinny data cables on both drives with stockier USB 3.0 cables I had but this measure only reduces errors for the first few minutes immediately after connecting. Just a fews minutes after connecting the errors begin.  When errors occur, the error handling routine asks if you want to try again or skip the file being processed.  Trying again always results in a failure of the current file being read or written.  Sometimes I'll even get a message saying ""you must reformat this drive before you can begin using it"". In the reviews here one person (kudos to him) said he buys these external drives, opens them up and removes the drives within to use as internal drives. I followed his lead with one of my 2 drives and plugged the removed Seagate drive into an Orico external hard drive docker that I bought on NewEgg (it came with a fat data cable). I had no errors after approximately 60 minutes straight of copying a large volume of data to the Seagate drive while it was mounted in the Orico external docking station, not one error.  My conclusion is that cheap parts chosen by Seagate are causing data errors.  My 4 TB drive appears to be working fine once I removed it from the error ridden Seagate external housing.  Cheap parts, i.e. skinny cable, no internal fan (and possibly the internal USB 3.0 circut board) = data errors.    I killed the warranty on 1 drive (so far) but I wasn't about to go through an RMA scenario with Seagate just to get a refurbished drive as a replacement having the same issues.",1,3

Should have seen this as a red flag right away, instead, I thought, ""Hey, I need this, my 2TB Hard Drive is coming down to its last 100GB so I should get this before I really run out of space!"," 30 Day NewEgg Warranty, that's a very strict timeline. About to contact SeaGate, and already reading reviews that I'm more than likely going to get a refurbished item.  Which doesn't matter to me, and makes sense, due to to how easy this drive dies on you.  2TB of family photos, videos, vacations, college graduations, etc. things that matter- gone.  And this drive gives false hope.  I used it right after the 30 day mark because college started for attaining my Master's Degree, and everyone knows the first month is very difficult to find any time for anything.  So I finally take it out of the box, back up my files with ease, wipe out my PC, and then proceed to transfer files.  About 20 minutes in (which should be a piece of cake for any drive), the blue light flashing (which indicates it's working), stays lit.  This means the drive froze or came across a difficult file (whatever that bogus means) or my new phrase, ""Thanks for trusting me with years of valuable and irreplaceable memories, now I'm going to bring you to your knees for being a seagate fan."" I leave it waiting because I tried to safely remove the drive- cannot, it's still in use.  I can't reset or hard reset because then I could risk damage to the drive (as with anything else storage related).  So I wait, and 5 minutes in, the drive shuts off.  It no longer is picked up.  I connect it to another computer, it light immediately goes solid blue, not flashing (as it should be), and is not picked up.  Wow.  25 minutes of use, and bam- dies on you.  Thanks SeaGate, not only will you replace a brand-new item with a refurbished one, you're going to give me one that's broken before, will probably break within the half hour, and 140 bucks (how much I paid at the time 8-21-2014) down the drain PLUS another amount for a 2TB because you made me realize the world isn't ready for a stable 4TB drive so the replacement is going to sit there and collect dust.  What a waste of money, a terror if you have valuable memories or files. Stay away from this one, EVEN if it is on special.  Ask yourself if it is worth saving money to lose all your data. That's what I ask myself now whenever I see another massive size drive for a ""great"" price."," Never again will I buy a SeaGate drive.

9SIA3TB1HF6350,22-178-354,8/8/2014 11:30:50 AM,Anonymous,Seagate Expansion 4TB HDD STBV4000100,4, - Good Price when On-Sale.- Reliable.- Lots of Storage Space., - 5900rpm drive is slower than 7200rpm drives.- Price has Not Dropped in 2 Years.- Need to Disconnect from Server to Allow Rebooting.," I have purchased and installed more than half a dozen of these Seagate 4TB drives and had no failures in more than 2 years of operating in a server environment.  The drives are very reliable in raid 0, or 1 configuration.  In my experience, they are as reliable as WD Red, WD Black, Toshiba, or HGST HDD's.   I have had no complaints about these drives for reliability.  I have used these in the stock enclosures and taken the drives out to use them instead of internal drives or in other enclosures.   The performance is equivalent in all configurations.  These drives go on-sale for US$139 regularly which is US$20-US$40 less than HDD's of equivalent size from other manufacturers.Given that the reliability is very good, there are some negatives to using these drives in the stock enclosures.  I found that, when I connect these drives up to a USB 3.0 hub on my servers, I cannot go through a reboot without disconnecting the HDD from the USB hub.  If I disconnect the HDD from the PC or server then do a shutdown or reboot of the computer, the startup/reboot works just fine (This is using a Windows 7 64-bit Pro OS or Windows  Home Server 11 OS).   If I take the 4TB out of the stock enclosure and install it either in an internal drive bay or other external enclosure (after reformatting the drive), I do not have problems with startup/rebooting the computers.   This is a minor problem since I use these on a server that stays operational 24/7 for long periods of time.   It would be more of a problem if I used these with a PC that was turned on and off frequently.   Going through the expense of purchasing a different enclosure and installing the HDD in those would be unreasonable.  The drive performance in terms of access times, or read/write speeds is not as good as the Seagate, Toshiba, or HGST 7200rpm drives.   This is to be expected since the platter speed is 5900rpm.   the read/write speeds certainly are fast enough to allow streaming of 5 simultaneous videos without hangup and to stream a video while simultaneously writing media files to the drive at 70Mbytes/sec over a gigabit ethernet connection.   Where I do see the difference is when transferring large amounts of data/files between HDD's.   In those circumstances the 7200rpm drives are about 30% faster.The price of these Seagate 4TB HDD's has not gone down in about 2 years.   Newegg regularly has them on sale for US$139.  Other HDD manufacturers have been lowering their prices gradually in that time to be competitive with the Seagate price.   Hopefully, now that 5TB and 6TB HDD's are available, the price for the 4TB HDD will start to come down again.  In conclusion; If you are looking for reliable storage with the best size to price ratio then these Seagate 4TB HDD's are the clear choice.  The problems with the stock external enclosure preventing reboot of the computer and the slightly slower read/write speed compared with 7200rpm drives is the reason I deducted an egg from the rating.",5,6

Only a con for people like me.," This is mainly to correct an erroneous review on someone else's part.USB 2.0 transfer rates max out at a theoretical 32 MB/s.Actual transfer rates from HDD's usually run in the 28 MB/s range.For this drive to get 140MB/s it's obviously running at USB 3.0 rates.A report of transfer rate is somewhat useless without specifying  the conditions under which it was obtained or comparing it to other drives.System hardware, OS, test used, and options within the test all affect the results.Others report 160-175 MB/s sequential writes which is in the range Seagate's 5900 RPM drives get and reviews say the drive runs cool which is also a characteristic of a 5900 rather than a 7200 RPM drive. The part # also implies a 5900 RPM drive.I just ran Crystal disk mark (64 bit) and got 88MB/s on the inner and 118MB/sec on the outer part of my Seagate 3TB NAS drive via  JMicron 363 eSata in a Akitio SK-3501 enclosure. Off the ICH9R eSATA II controller rates are 8% higher, and if connected directly to the Intel controller rates are 17% higher.The same drive in a different enclosure runs 6% less than the Akitio enclosure off the Intel controller.Everything affects transfer and IOPS rates.No drive with spinning platters will match an SSD's transfer or IOPS rates until they discover something new in the laws of physics.4K R/W and IOPS rates are what matter in Windows and most, not all, other OS's to ""feel fast"".

9SIA4T01H90252,22-178-116,7/22/2014 1:17:30 PM,Geoffrey B.,Off to a terrible start,1, Very speedy delivery by NewEgg," Bought the drive to backup my HD using Windows Backup (no need for the bells and whistles in other backup packages in my world so I stick to the standard here).  Set it up on arrival and started complete backup at about 7 PM. By 3:19 AM it had failed to complete (error code 0x8078002A) ""one of the backup files could not be created"".  Spent several hours off and on the Seagate site trying to find solutions and started running their SeaTools diagnostic about 8:30 AM.  Now it is 4 PM and it's still running with no progress meter, no diagnostics, just sitting there eating CPU cycles.  Started case with Seagate via e-mail this AM, and no acknowledgement from them yet that I exist.  Bottom line is that this turkey is going back, probably tomorrow or as soon as I can get an RMA."," If, as another responder indicated, for some reason this device is incompatible with Windows Backup, the fact belongs in the product specs.  Otherwise all you are doing is setting yourself up for the administrative overhead of an RMA and annoying a faithful customer.",1,3

I use them for photographs and DSLR video and find great utility in their speed. I also keep my Steam library on them, and load times are very reasonable. I've had them for about seven months now, and the particular pair I have has been good."," The first pair I ordered were both DOA. I can only assume they were from a bad batch for this reason. Newegg was very reasonable about the exchange, and the two replacement drives have worked great.My greatest concern is that they never turn off. Even if they're unplugged from USB, the drives keep spinning. This gives me concern over their longevity, and I usually end up unplugging them when not in use.In addition, the power blocks make a fizzing sound."," I got these on sale, and despite the cons, they do everything I expect.

Following all of the instructions in the software I couldn't get the test to pass on the inner sectors.  The software recommended I RMA, and gave me a number to send with the RMA to Seagate showing the drive was faulty.

Went through Seagate to get a replacement. Replacement was bad. Both tested with Seatools, both failed the long tests. I bought the drive to use with Windows backup in Windows 7. I did not find out until after talking with tech support that this drive is not compatible with Windows backup in Windows 7. No where is it listed in any documentation. Cannot return it now.

Essentially, this means the heads will park independently of software settings in your operating system (that you control). The more start and stopping of the disk's heads - the quicker the drive will wear out, usually just outside of Seagate's new 1-2 year warranties. Ridiculous!You might have already noticed this phenomenon by hearing a random ""chirping"" noise coming from your Seagate drive.Despite a massive public outcry for Seagate to fix this - they remain silent.Here's a working solution, albeit not perfect. You can run a tiny TSR when you boot Windows - CrystalDiskInfo. In the options, you can disable APM at boot. It's not perfect, but it uses little memory and serves as a temporary fix. There's also a command line script that will work with Linux - I'm unsure about Mac OS at this time.Another note: Seagate external drives are now operating at temps of 50-60 degrees. 20-30 degrees are ideal temps. Beware!This is all very frustrating to me. I've been buying Seagate drives since my first double height 5.25"" 20MB MFM drive. All my older Seagate drives I have still work great. I knew something felt off when they dropped their 3-5 year warranties.I would advise avoiding the newer Seagate drives until this gets fixed - if it gets fixed. If you already bought one of these; I hope this information is useful - please share, and remember: BACKUP, BACKUP, BACKUP!",,9,10

SeaTools to diagnose HD wouldn't even detect drive."," So I have always used another brand's externals but after one of them failed I decided I'd give Seagate a try. Based on my experience thus far, this will be my last Seagate product. From Day 1, the drive would intermittently drop connection to my computer, annoying but not the end of the world. However, as time progressed, the HD started becoming randomly inaccessible and disappearing entirely from under My Computer. It miserably failed a Check Disk and I wound up having to reformat, hoping that was the end of the problems, it wasn't.About 2 weeks later, the drive started down the same path. At this point, I started digging into known issues with the drive and the issue sounded similar to firmware issues from the Barracuda 7200.11 HDs.I contacted customer support, went through 2 e-mails of testing/troubleshooting to no avail. I have 2 other external HDs from another manufacturer that currently work perfectly fine in all USB ports and tested the Seagate external using their USB cables and still have the same issue (as well as having the same issues with the Seagate external on 2 other computers).Will be returning the drive today, will see how Seagate responds.",0,1

Buyer Beware., Failed with little use a little less then two months outside of 1 year warranty.Couldn't even play ~30-40 gb's of games a dozen or so times before failing.1 year warranty is telling you something (when they have 2-5 year warranties on other models)Used at USB 2.0 speeds so it wasn't taxing it at full USB 3.0 speed....ever.," Bought this for additional storage for my Wii U when it launched.Obviously didn't use it very much with the lack of games and the launch games on disc.  Only had Wind Waker and Splinter Cell: Blacklist on the hard drive, plus a couple of demos.  So probably all in told I had only asked it to write about 30-40 gb's or so.  Completely unacceptable to fail that soon after it barely writes and rarely needed to read it, and at USB 2.0 speeds.Though also if you notice both those games didn't come out until Aug/Sept 2013, so this HD was wasting it's warranty.  Actual use was like two months of light use and now having it fail after not using it for a couple of months since then.Had it been in my PC it would have probably failed within the year it had under warranty, but since it was in the Wii U it saw alot less usage, thus it only fully failed after the warranty by under two months.Decided to boot up Blacklist after not playing it for months and it crashed about 10 minutes in.   Nothing would show up from there in the Wii U menu.  Restarting the console and using a different USB port did nothing.  Trying to reformat on Wii U using it's format option did nothing.Had noticed it working weird and the games not showing up a few months ago a time or two, so it probably had been about to fail for a while, but I didn't think it was the HD.   Also had it running in USB 2.0 mode, and it can't handle even USB 2.0 speeds.  It simply is a bad drive no matter how you use it.  If you think it might be more reliable being used via USB 2.0, nope.Wish I would have RMA'ed it when problems started, but with my dad dying certain things take a backseat for more pressing matters.  Now the warranty has passed.Plugged it into my PC and not only would it not allow me to initialize or format it, but it also failed the short and long generic Sea Tools tests and was not able to 'fix'.  It's definitely not the power supply either obviously.  So something is messed with it, but nothing I can do.Horrible drive, and the 1 year warranty is a farce.    Have bought many HD's over the years.  Disappointed in this model's build quality.  You must ask yourself why is it that some Seagate HD's have a 1 year warranty and others have up to a 5 year warranty.  IMO stay away from the 1 year warranty Seagate HD's, it's almost as if they are telling you it's likely to fail as they don't want to stand behind it like many of their other models.If you do buy it, use it early and often to make sure you didn't get a bum one.   Sick of hardware failures from 3rd world slave labor manufactured products.  This, a PS4 controller, and an impossible to buy LGA1366 motherboard which forced a new PC build all since May 2013.  If you can't do QA in the 3rd world there's millions of Americans who need jobs.  2.8 million more unemployed just in the last yr. Forget the unemployment number, it's a complete an utter lie.",0,6

The other reviewers here that gave it bad rep if you'll notice, burned it out, and was trying to use it like an internal. There are no methods of cooling, so if you use it at 150% for a week, writing zeros to it, of course it's gonna get hot. Use it like an external, for backing up, and storing of media, this will work top notch. I average about 11 mb/s transfer rates, even though it has peaked at 18 mb/s before. I heavily rely on it, and it has yet to let me down."," None that I can think of, other than power saving mode, which after about 10 minutes of inactivity, it will power down, then it takes about 10 seconds for it to reload and display in Explorer. The light on the back is nice, for knowing when it's working, but it could be dimmer. If I leave my desktop on, say downloading overnight, the light does keep me away, due to it lighting up the wall that the light faces. Even if its on the far wall, it illuminates the wall, and I have dark walls as well. So tape, or rolling over on your other side is necessary, since it even lights up my ceiling. It wouldn't be as bad, if it was a solid light, not a rapidly blinking one."," Other than power save mode, and the light, it is perfect. Bit of short cables for both USB and power, but the drive itself is fine. The only things that need improving, are things other than the drive itself.I will say, if you have issues plugging it into a computer and not showing, thats due to a drive letter conflict. When on my netbook, which it was labeled D:\, it would have issues on my desktop, since it had a DVD drive labeled D:\. To fix this, just go into Computer Management on Windows, and rename it to E:\, or any other available letter to fix this problem.I would strongly recommend this drive to anyone.",4,4

Waking up the hard drive takes between 15 and 20 seconds.," I have owned a number of different internal and external hard drives over the years across multiple computers, some of which I built myself. Right now I own two MyBook external hard drives- a 1TB and a 3TB- which I use to store everything except apps that need to be installed on the operating drive (C:\). I bought my 3TB MyBook about a year and a half ago (I've had my 1TB for longer), and from day 1 I had the freedom to store just about an endless amount of videos, photos, documents, and other stuff. At night, I put my computer to sleep and when I move the mouse to wake it up, the hard drive turns on with the computer. The only complaint I have with this hard drive is the auto-sleep feature. After ten minutes of no use, the MyBook will ""sleep"". When you open it in Windows to access a file, the computer will appear to lock up for about 15 to 20 seconds as the hard drive wakes up. This is intended to extend the lifespan of the drive, and once the hard drive is awake, the computer will unfreeze and you will have access to the blazing speeds of USB 3.0 (assuming you have 3.0 ports), and the hard drive won't sleep until another 10-minute period of non-use. If you do not have USB 3.0 on your computer, you can still plug the drive into USB 2.0 or 1.1 ports. It won't run as fast, but for most people, the speed of USB 2.0 is sufficient. Any computer with Windows XP or a newer operating system will automatically detect and install the drivers, and your hard drive will be ready to go. Be aware that while the hard drive comes with its own software, you do not need to install it to use the hard drive. I always access it directly in Windows. I recommend this hard drive to anyone, especially those with large amounts of data that they want stored in one central location.",5,5

Half the time I plug it in it isn't recognized, and when it is it takes a couple minutes after plugging it to appear at all. Always gives a ""you must format the drive in (letter) before you can use it"" message when connecting. Must be some extremely weird driver software, I have never ever seen a drive that worked this weirdly.Once it connects it's liable to disconnect, even while in active use. I've been trying to copy lots of  files to/from this thing today and I've had it disconnect mid-copy twice, always within 20 minutes of starting the copy.To reconnect it I have to unplug the unit's power. It has a ""power"" button on the drive but the drive has to be functioning on the PC for the button to work; it's a software button, useless when you need it. Often the light will turn off on the drive and this means it's stopped working. Only physically pulling the power cable will let it *attempt* to connect again.The backup software is garbage. It nags you to upgrade to a pro version and currently reports that I have 34 TB of data backed up on this 3TB drive."," This is my second drive, I had one replaced from the first unit.

One I returned for an exchange (after wasting many hours transferring data to it), the other, with almost 3 TB of data on it (and representing more than 24 hours of my transferring data), I took into my local computer shop.  The USB port in the drive is an extremely delicate, poorly designed piece of garbage.  Soldering it (at a cost of $75, almost as much as the drive itself) failed within a week.  It's possible to replace the port, at another cost of $85.  The drive is cheaper than competitive drives.  That's because there's no quality built in, and the drives are poorly designed.

I purchased 3 of these drives about 10 months ago on sale for $99.99.  The OEM 3TB drives with the same model number without the case were $30 more at the time so this sale was a steal for me.

Also moved it cross-country twice with no issues. If you need a lot of storage on short notice and don't have a lot of loot (which was my exact situation), then this is a fantastic drive.

Luckily for me, this drive was only used to store backups of my DVD/BluRay collection so nothing of real importance was lost, other than my time and money.

Probably the most annoying one. The off button also doesn't seem to work unless it has a proper connection to the PC, so to turn it off and on again you have to pull the plug-- off and on again works maybe 50% of the time to make it connect.Basically what seems to be the problem is the drivers I have never had to wait so long for an external drive to be recognized, I suspect there's some extremely wonky software at work here.A great piece of hardware completely ruined by horrible, horrible software at every turn.

While ""the fix"" did resolve some issues it created others."," As mentioned above I reviewed this drive months ago and was very disappointed. I was suspicious of WD's reply as I had already performed everything they stated to resolve the issue. i.e. a firmware update, installed the SES driver and reformatted the drive as indicated on their web site. At that point along with some other tweaks the drive would no longer mysteriously disappear and relegated the drive for basic mundane backups as I did not trust the drive. So I went ahead and updated the firmware, reinstalled the SES driver and downloaded and ran the quick formatter.The first thing I noticed was while the version numbers on the file were the same the software had changed. Now instead of “factory default"" you have a “Vista or later option” in addition to the XP compatibility option. So I went through the entire process, formatted the drive and started a Windows image. Which ran ok, hurray, so then I tried to restore it, big failure, windows didn’t see the drive. So I recreated the rescue disk, ok this time it saw the backup. Tried it again, didn’t see the drive, had to unplug and re-plug the drive in and start process over ok, this time saw the drive. So maybe this problem is solved however I'm to scared to trust the drive as a primary backup. Also now whenever I boot my PC I have to unplug and plug in the drive to see the drive. Oh and XP can’t see the drive, surprised, no, expected that. The tweaks I used before to get the drive to always stay on don’t work now. I have to unplug and plug in the drive every time I want to use it and I had to jump through all these hoops and hours of backing up and testing to tell me what I already read and suspected. These drives are unreliable."," Due to the nature of my work I recommend people use basic 1TB HDD’s and install them in basic external enclosures you purchase separately. They always work, perform normally as expected and reliably, are afordable, and are usable with both XP and Window 7.  WD has really let me down.

Not the drives, but the case electronics.  Fantom uses a Western Digital Green drive (at least in mine.) and it runs very cool in standby. A little warmer when working.  One of the reasons it runs cool is because it shuts down in standby.  There IS a delay as the drive spins up from standby. I list that a Con, but it is not a defect of any kind.

I purchased two of these drives in May of 2009. One went to my brother & the other I kept for myself. 6 months ago his drive started to experience periods where it would not be recognized by the PC and he experienced the same clicking noises as well. He examined the drive using SEVERAL data diagnostic tools, which all stated the imminent death of the drive due to numerous bad sectors. I provided the receipt for his RMA and his was supposedly ""replaced."" My drive, which had exhibited none of the issues his had three months ago just one day started giving errors as well and upon examination I discovered the bad sectors...within 1hr after that diagnosis the entire drive contents started disappearing file by file until finally, I was unable to access the drive at all...It completely disappeared and was unrecognizable by Windows. I was unable to format it and it was basically worthless."," Poor and Somewhat Rude Customer Service. Drive has numerous problems, erased my data and STILL the rep had the nerve to say it could be repaired or formatted...and actually questioned WHY I wanted it replaced even if it was within warranty. The emphasis in the emails was on it being formatted and NOT REPLACED. Here's my thing: When a drive has a complete failure to the extent where your files disappear, it becomes inaccessible to ANY computer then that's a drive you don't want anywhere near your data. Why on earth wouldn't I want a new drive to replace this??? Also why on earth would they not give me a brand new drive if the warranty has not expired?? Simply put it's because MicroNet does not care about their customers, just about the money you're willing to shell out for something that's significantly inferior when compared to other brands."," I recovered 85% of my files using file recovery software and the rest were eaten by bad sectors. I did the RMA to Micronet and I received the ""drive"" today. IT IS THE SAME DRIVE. SAME CASE. SAME BOX. Same stray marker on casement. No attempt was made to give me a new drive replacement. They successfully formatted the drive, but examination by drive management software allowed me to see the SAME BAD SECTORS still on the drive on the disk surface. So, it's evident that they DO NOT stand by their warranty (as this is still within warranty) and REFUSED and indeed had no intention of EVER replacing this with a new drive. That is a company with no honor or respect for their customers. Save your money and go elsewhere. I own 4 other external drives and they're still in existence 3 years later with no problems. This is a piece of junk that didn't even last one year.",4,4

External Drives are to not to be used or running at high transfer rates for sustained periods of time. ALA One review to take out unit and put in case with the difference being a 1 year warranty to the internal drive that has 3 year warranty. WARRANTY FYI begins on the date on manufacture. Learn this the hard way when you buy a WD with a one year warranty and it runs for two weeks and then takes a huge dump on your desktop. Check it on WD.com and find out it went out of Warranty even though I bought it 3 weeks earlier.. I have always left all external drives running 24 hours a day and have added KeepAliveHD to circumvent the sleepy sleep mode that Laptops try to use to save battery live and manufacturers use to try to save HD Life. Life Support but then you have to worry about spun down that will not come back up as Windows has shut down in the middle of the night to install a new Skypee driver. LOL. Not funny but too many drives freeze up and KeepAliveHD-FYI FREE Software will manage a whole network of HDs-no more sleepy sleep ready to rock and roll on command.

Speed Fan-FREE Software will give you SMART reading for all temperatures on all HDs. WOW you will see that the temperature for the most part are too high no matter what and where you have them placed. No fan on the enclosure is the reason but there is solution for another time. You want to be sure you are within reason AND control the CPUs fans and be able to increase speeds of CPU fans with CPU. You will find alignment for other drives that will cut precious degrees from running temperature. The worse things for HDs is unplugging the USD Wire while the drive is still operating; high temperature; sleep mode or battery dead or drained suspension-so make sure when you are buying the back up unit that it includes plug ins for the USB external drives. 30 years ago HDs were $1000 for 10MB do the math.

I was getting very fast transfer rates of my large video files over Usb 3.-Price- I got mine on a shellshocker deal for $70, but I could have easily spent $100 and been just as satisfied. This drive is a full 1.87 TB with formatting, which is an absurd amount of storage for the semi-casual user like myself, but it will last me a long time (hopefully) before running out of space.-Quiet Operation- Aside from the spin-up noise, the sound that comes from the drive when actually copying files in minimal. With it right in front of me on my desk the sound completely disappeared when I turned on some low-volume music or watched a video."," -Long Spin-Up times- One thing I noticed about this drive is that it seems to be very ""lazy"".  Not in the sense of low read/write speeds, but in the fact that it likes to sleep after seemingly short sessions of inactivity. This wouldn't be too cumbersome, but when I'm doing some real work at my computer and have a spur of the moment ""I should back this up!"" thought, having to wait the solid 20-30 seconds for the drive to spin back up is sort of bothersome. I understand the reasoning of Seagate had behind this feature, because a fast drive like this is bound to use some power if left constantly spinning.-Heat- While I haven't experienced any actual heat-related problems, the heat this drive produces after long write or read periods is troubling. After all, it is a full-on 7200 rpm Desktop HD in an external enclosure, so it is bound to heat up a bit. The problem is that the casing around the drive doesn't seem to be too concerned with cooling. There are some small air holes in the rear and back of the drive, but I'm not sure how much heat they actually help dissipate when the drive is in use."," For the sale price of $70 for the 2TB model it's no wonder they sold out so fast; it was an absolute steal. But for the regular sales price I would still definitely recommend this drive to anyone that wants fast, high capacity storage at a low price.",2,2

Formatted right away, past the drive stress test and measured 180-190MB/sec for both read and write through USB 3. Works great with my MacBook Air.With the use of four old credit cards and hotel card keys, as well as an Otter Box screen protecter applier (thinner than a credit card but still fairly stiff plastic), I had the case off in about 3 minutes. Granted, you have to deal with the plastic clips, there are no screws in the case. However, this was the easiest drive to open I've ever encountered. Removed the drive from enclosure, tucked it into my Mediasonic ProBay 4 bay USB 3.0 enclosure, and we're off and running!Inside the ProBay it gets about 140-170 MB/sec read and write. A tad slower, but still nice and speedy, considering the bus is shared between four drives.There are absolutely no scuffs and scrapes on the case, and once snapped back together it looks brand new. The case is a very nice, hard textured black plastic and is visually pleasing and nice to the touch as well.I also loaded the drive up and tested it within its own enclosure. Removing it from the enclosure and putting it into the ProBay did not result in losing any data, or having to reformat the drive. It worked perfectly.This drive will be used as a media server drive, and will never spin down or go to sleep. I will update this review if the drive fails within an unacceptable period of time. For now, I assume it will be a great long lasting drive (knock on wood)."," The drive did get a little warm inside its own enclosure. Once I put it in the ProBay, it stays nice and cool. There is no fan inside the case (which is nice, as I'm a studio musician, any excess noise while laying down tracks is a no no), but you might want to put the enclosure somewhere cooler (not near a hot monitor or computer, for example) if you keep it in its original enclosure.The ProBay has a very nice variable speed fan, and on the low setting it is extremely quiet and keeps things nice and cool.No other cons as of yet.This drive will be used as a media server drive, and will never spin down or go to sleep. I will update this review if the drive fails within an unacceptable period of time. For now, I assume it will be a great long lasting drive (knock on wood)."," NewEgg is the best.

I can definitely tell the difference between the USB 3.0 speeds of this drive compared to similar USB 2.0 drives. My drive was purchased elsewhere but I have never had a problem with Newegg. It just happened I found it at a better price elsewhere.," Where the USB cable attaches to the external drive a non-standard cable is used. It has a larger than standard molded connector with 2 small mini ""D"" connectors that frequently seems to get disconnected when the drive is moved around even a small amount. Too large of a connector that just doesn't want to stay securely connected. The drive is made to work with PCs or Macs thus the 2 mini ""D"" Connectors. I think that Mac users can use a standard Mac cable to connect to the drive in order to use whatever the new Macs have as an improvement over standard USB 3.0. Not a Mac fan so I really don't keep up with what they are doing. Look closly at the Newegg pics where it can be seen.", While happy with the transfer speeds (sorry haven't benchmarked it) I really do not like the non-standard USB cable that comes with the unit.I would hate to have to attempt to find a replacement as it would probably have to come from Seagate and likely at a premium $$$.,0,4

(Thanks NEWEGG.COM) plenty of space easy to install, fast to read, superfast to write. I hope works for a long time. I use only for storage, noiseless, light.", none untill now.," used on the road,  used in different laptops and desktops without troubles.",0,2
9SIA4T01H90252,22-178-116,10/15/2012 6:35:10 PM,Leonard A.,This is a good choice.,4," This is a great, small, quiet, relatively energy efficient, well constructed external hard drive at a reasonable price from one of my favorite manufacturers. On USB 2.0, it works as well as any other portable hard drive. On USB 3.0, it is almost as fast as the same drive plugged directly into the motherboard. The drive, a Seagate ST2000DL003-9VT166, is essentially identical to one I have used before inside standard desktop cases, with no customer complaints. This unit works on USB 2.0, as well. Backing up my old Windows XP system took 13 hours on USB 2.0, but only eight on USB 3.0, so the faster interface is worth getting if you don’t have it already. If you want a reasonably cheap, simple way to have your computer in one place, and your data in another, this drive is a great way to do it. Put it in a secure, fireproof place, and you won’t go wrong."," One must use the included USB 3.0 cable, and a USB 3.0 port for maximum speed, but this is not a con because these are required for any true USB 3.0 device. This cable is a bit hard to find now, if you lose it, but I suspect that this will change as USB 3.0 gets more common. I suppose I would have liked the activity light on the front of the case rather than on the top rear, but this is also not really a con unless one wants to stack several of these, or use them in odd positions, which might make this enclosure get too hot. The case is clearly designed to work only in one position, but again, I don’t think this is a large drawback. I would not suggest using this enclosure on carpet, but this is common sense for many devices. This drive does not power down by itself when not being used, but I don’t think any USB drive does this, so this also is not really a con. An on-off switch would have been really great, but if one wants to save power, one can naturally unplug the unit. I do this anyway for anything I am not using, so this is not a huge drawback either. Windows 7 Backup, WHICH IS EXTREMELY SHAKY AT BEST, will cheerfully backup to this drive, but can’t restore from it, possibly due to a physical versus logical sector size problem, although I have no way of actually verifying this. This appears to happen on a number of newer high capacity drives and is NOT really a fault of Seagate. This is not an issue that Seagate is familiar with, probably because very few people actually use Windows 7 Backup.You must use third party software, as in XP, to backup and restore Windows 7 successfully from this drive. Seagate’s free ""Disk Wizard"" will actually backup to and restore from this drive, and if you mount the image it creates, will allow you to browse for files and restore individual ones, but not without some inconvenience. So you might still want to use or purchase another program for your backup needs. This issue is a gentle reminder to completely TEST a backup and restore solution before actually NEEDING it. If the drive had come with really great backup software, I would have given it the full five eggs."," It is hard not to like this drive. It has none of the drawbacks of a couple of my other portable drives. It has no noisy fan, no cheap, disintegrating case parts, and no second rate components of any kind. It also does NOT come from an anonymous vendor with no support.It even uses a modern 12 volt DC switch-mode power supply, which could conceivably be replaced with something else locally available. The instruction pamphlet shows a version with various inserts for worldwide plugs. This unit is the USA version without this feature, although the supply itself will run on any voltage from 100 to 240 VAC. So you would just need simple adaptors to use it while globetrotting. I won’t bore you with my benchmarking results, because these are about the same as ones available all over the place for similar drives, as the USB 3.0 interface really does not cramp its style.",11,11
9SIA4T01H90252,22-178-116,10/12/2012 3:55:19 PM,Matthew M.,"Reliable high-capacity drive, but it's lacking in some areas…",3," The first thing I noticed about this drive was how easy it was to set-up. It's already formatted in NTFS and ready to use. Just connect it to your PC, fire it up and you can immediately start using it. There is even a setup file stored in the root of the drive that helps you register this product with Seagate. They definitely scored some points here for making the initial setup a painless process.    I also found that this drive is reliable. Other USB drives I've owned in the past tend to disconnect randomly at times, but I've had no such issues with this drive.    I was able to connect to this drive over my home network without any issues, which makes backing data from all my PC's rather easy. Now, Windows networking is not very reliable in general, but that's not Seagate's fault.     As far as transfer rates go, I achieved some respectable numbers when connected via a USB 2.0 port. I hit 35 MB/s on large file transfers, and around 20-25 MB/s with small files. That's pretty much maxing out USB 2.0's real-world transfer speeds (you never hit the theoretical max due to overhead).    My primary PC is built around an X58 motherboard, which doesn't support USB 3.0. However, I connected this drive to a buddies PC (he owns a Z77 build that supports USB 3.0) and was able to hit 80 MB/s on a large file transfer. That's pretty impressive actually. I'm sure speeds will vary depending on the specific USB 3.0 controller, so I wouldn't be surprised if some folks hit 100 MB/s+ on certain configurations. Overall, transfer rates are definitely respectable no matter which interface you use, but obviously USB 3.0 is the way to go if your system supports it.     Some people have complained that this drive gets too hot. I have to say that I haven't noticed this at all. Even during heavy use it seems to remain nice and cool on my desk.  No problems here as far as that goes.     I do like the aesthetics in regards to the enclosure. It has a nice minimalistic look that blends in well with my gear.   The price is more than reasonable for what you're getting here.  You end up with 1.81 TB after the drive is formatted, which is plenty of space for just about anyone. I was able to free up a ton of space on my internal drives."," No software is included with the drive at all. I would have loved to see some basic drive imaging software included. I have Acronis 2010 installed on my system, which does work with this drive under Windows. However, if I boot up via my Acronis rescue disc (uses Win PE), the utility will hang during initialization when I have this drive connected to my system. Technically, Acronis's rescue disc should work fine with this drive as it includes USB\SATA drivers on the boot disc, but it just doesn't play well with it for some reason (under USB 2.0 mind you). This is a pretty big drawback, because I am unable to restore an image from this drive in the event that my primary hard drive fails.    No eSATA support. This is another big drawback in my opinion. There are a lot of folks out there with PC's that don't support USB 3.0, but do support eSATA. I really think Seagate should have catered to this crowd. eSATA can achieve real-world transfer speeds far greater than USB 2.0. I will admit that USB 3.0 makes eSATA obsolete, but it's too early to abandon eSATA altogether.    I think a stand should have been included to make the unit sturdier if you decide to stand it up on its side. You can still do this, but it's a bit precarious in this position. Not only will standing the unit on its side save some room, but it will help the drive run cooler as well.   It would also be nice to have an activity LED on the front of the unit. Their is a solid blue LED on the top that lets you know the unit is powered up, but that's about it. This isn't a big deal, but I thought I'd mention it.  "," I can definitely recommend this drive to those of you looking for an easy way to back up your media and documents (or any other important data). As I said, it's reliable and very easy to set-up and use. That said, the fact that it doesn't ship with any backup software (of any kind) really gets to me. Those of you looking for a drive to backup\restore images will probably want to look at some other solutions. I'm sure there is some third-party software available that works with this drive, but it's not going to be free.    Also, if your system doesn't support USB 3.0 you may want to go with a drive that supports eSATA. This will give you much better transfer rates.",2,5
9SIA4T01H90252,22-178-116,10/11/2012 6:05:20 PM,Ari A.,"A solid value, but slim on features",3," This Seagate is a good 2TB external drive, offering a large amount of storage at a fair if not truly competitive price. It's also relatively fast using a USB3 connection. Inside the housing is Seagate's 5900rpm hard drive, which sells for about the same price as a bare drive, making this external a better deal. I used CrystalDiskMarkto determine the speed of the drive. The data averaged over 3 runs are as follows:Large Sequential Read: 141.7 MB/s, Write: 136.8 MB/s512K Sequential Read:70.7 MB/s, Write: 101.5 MB/s4k Read: 1.22 MB/s, Write 0.69 MB/sWhile the write speeds are not as good as my internal 5400rpmSamsung F4 2TB drive over Sata2, the read speeds are superior, which is a testament both to this drive and to the throughput of USB3. It's also much faster than my 2.5"""" 7200rpm USB3 drive in all respects, which shows that 3.5"""" drives still hold a big advantage even when they are rated slower."," I could see this best being used as a storage drive for frequently accessed data or applications. It is fast and has a large capacity. As a backup drive, this model really doesn't have as much to offer. It comes with no software - the only program on the hard drive itself is the warranty registration app, and nothing comes in the box but a simple instruction booklet, the relatively large power adapter, and the USB3 cable. For the average user, this drive doesn't provide everything you need in the box to run it as a full-featured backup drive. Furthermore, the power use of this drive is less than ideal. At idle, it uses approximately 7w, which is a very significant amount for a backup drive, and it's even a bit high for an applications drive. During sequential operations, it uses between 9w and 10w, also a very high number for a drive in this performance class. Once the computer is put to sleep or turned off, it uses about 1w, which is again surprising given that it should be off at that point. See temperature data below for a negative side-effect of this power use. In addition, I was surprised that no on/off switch was provided. For the purposes of a backup drive, especially one that uses as much power as this one, I would think that most users would want the option to turn the drive off when not in use. Finally, the drive only has a 1-year warranty. This is below average, and actually lower than even other Seagate products. This concerns me given its intended purpose as a storage drive."," When first turned on, the drive idles at a temperature of 37* C in an ambient of 26* C, but slowly heats up over hours of idling to about 46* C, due to the lack of any power-saving features. It reaches 47* C under sustained use. That's relatively high and and may have an impact on the lifespan of the drive. Luckily, the case just gets slightly warm - and this makes me thing the temperature diode is providing incorrect readings. The drive is also somewhat audible, even at idle, and while this is expected of a 3.5"""" desktop-class drive, it's not ideal. Overall, this drive is quite capable as an external applications drive. For backup purposes, however, there are many 2.5""""-class backup drives available up to 1TB for quite a bit less money that are quieter, use significantly less power, take up much less space, require no external adapter, and have more features. Their lower speed would be a fair tradeoff for their many benefits. At the same time, competing 2TB drives often come with more space-efficient (and attractive) vertical designs and included backup utilities.",7,9

I was able to transfer from my SSD drive to the Seagate Expansion a 10 Gb video file in 78 seconds using the USB 3.0 while USB 2.0 took 6 minutes for the same 10 Gb file. It comes pre-formatted with a NTFS partition. Seagate offers great support with diagnostic tools and commonly asked questions on there website.

This is a new model."," Even though this is a harddrive with huge capacity its still a usb drive. So no smart data capability. It will not warn you if its headed for a drive failure. Another problem is it will not stand up, so you are stuck laying in down which take up more space. Unlike the Seagate Backup drive you cannot take the end cap off and attach it directly to a SATA port and power cable.

Ether USB 2.0 or 3.0 it will work for storage or streaming video, movies or music. No frills just plug in and go.

Both times Win didn't see drive again until I shut down pc, powered off WD drive, restarted computer, then replugged in the drive.  No data lost, but it's an odd instability I've not seen in any other drive."," This drive is what I'd call somewhat buggy and unstable, as new products often are.

SmartWare never forced me to install - never even bothered to ask.  So, I removed it from the software from the drive, and haven't heard a peep from the software since.  So, maybe WD finally made the software completely optional this time?  Don't know, but I'm not complaining!!  If so, I say get this drive now before they change their minds!!Also, I was unable to thoroughly test the drive, as WD Lifeguard couldn't even see the drive, and HD Tune just reported 100% bad blocks, which I know isn't right as I've been transferring data to it without issue.So, I will update if anything happens, but so far I've been happy!!",2,2

The standard plug is too fat, and the HD panel is aluminum, so thicker than a steel panel might be. The plug doesn't seat deep enough, so wobbles about, causing the drive to disappear, even if the Bios saw it in the first place (had to hold the cable in place to make this work..)I eventually cut some of the plastic body of the plug away so that it would seat into the cutout properly, and it's now held on by a rubber band to keep it from wobbling around! At least the bios now sees it every time. esata plugs are a very poor design in the first place compared to fiewire or usb, but this implementation makes it even worse, especially since they don't supply a compatible esata cable with this drive (or an internal to external panel if you don't have one already.)"," I'll keep it because I can't be bothered sending it back.

(First of all, I have only used the Fantom via USB.) The Fantom ""wakes up"" faster than my WD Mybook 320gb. Whenever you don't use files on the drive for ~10min, the drive stops spinning, same for all external usb HDD's. The Fantom takes ~ 6 secs to resume where the Mybook takes ~11 secs. Awesome. I was surprised to see the entire enclosure is made out what I assume to be thick durable aluminum all the while remaining very small and compact. Overall volume is less than the 320gb Mybook. Like others have said, the Fantom is very cool and quiet. If there is a fan I can't hear one. It only makes noise when resuming from sleep. And of course the drive never gets warmer than about room temperature. I think the metal casing acts like a huge heat sink. And finally 931gb for this price is awesome!"," In my opinion, a small drawback is that the HDD cannot be turned off via usb, meaning I must turn off my computer, be sure the HDD is unmounted, and then flip the switch on the back of the enclosure. Also, the LED burns my eyeballs out. I tried to put a layer of tape over the LED to dim it but it shown right through the tape and even some card-stock I tried to. I ended up aiming the drive into a corner on my desk which now makes half of my desk reflect blue light."," Great delivery time. Not-so-great packaging. The only shock protection in the shipping box was crushed brown paper, not peanuts or airbags. Of course I should say, this was apparently adequate as even the Fantom box was not damaged at all.",1,1

Runs very cool as well--3+hrs of data transfer via USB2.0 and while the drive isn't *cold*, it's hardly over room temp.  Most heat efficient drive I've seen.  Power saver features (such as poweroff after 5 mins of inactivity) will do well to prolong life, and I do not mind to seek time when powering back up, as it's a 1-time thing.  Great production qualities too, very sleek look and sturdy feeling in the provided stand.  Stand is plastic, but you couldn't tell that.  Has no-slip feet to boot.  I would strongly recommend this drive for the price.", Doesn't come with an eSATA cable.," I had originally gotten very frustrated, because on my Macbook Pro, playing MP3s from the hard drive in programs such as VLC and Quicktime caused the MP3 to skip every ~30 seconds or so, and during that split second of silence I could hear the hard drive seeking.  I was originally going to either return the drive or invest in an eSATA cable when I thought to try other programs.  MPlayer and iTunes (the only program I really cared about for music) read external MP3s without a hitch.  So, I decided the culprit is the inefficient coding of the programs which skip (they do not skip the second time through).  This is just a hypothesis, but it seemed to hold.  Drive works great.",5,5

I think one of the best features is it conserves power when you aren't using it. For Example: if you are copying and or moving or even playing from the drive spins but when you aren't doing any of the above.. it's silent, never spins up and conserves power which in return also produces less heat and less ware and tear on the drive. The copying speeds through USB are pretty fast around 50mbps - 80mbps would be faster if I could use the eSATA but laptop doesn't have plug for it (maybe when I get a new desktop built)Power LED in the Front is a very dim green. Kinda nice compared to some External HD's that have very Bright and annoying power LED. Has a neat design on the Side and comes in a fancy brushed metal that looks and goes nicely with my Vaio along with a Vertical Stand to place it upright in. :)"," To be honest can't think of many if any true cons. It's default format is Fat32 so if you want NTFS you'll have to reformat but that takes matter of minutes. It doesn't come with an eSATA cable so if you tend to use it you'll have to buy one. USB Cable was kinda short, 3' I think. Not long enough for my liking but you could always pick up another for $5-10 no problem if you need the extra length.", Also it isn't an EXACT 1TB more like 980 something Gig but what's the difference?! if you need more space just add another to your cart.

I've used WD for many many years, internal and external, and they've all been excellent. Currently I have two WD 2TB drives in my system, and one 500GB, hybrid coupled with a 4GB SSD cache drive. I also have a 2TB WD external drive. In short, for storing my data, I've never gone wrong with WD."," Can't answer the ""cons"" since I don't OWN the drive yet, but in a few days, I will. My current WD external (USB 2.0, 2TB drive) has been with me for years without a problem. I really just wanted to comment on the boot problems when the drive is plugged in (See ""Other thoughts."")"," WD can't be blamed for boot problems on some systems. It's the BIOS in the computer that needs to be either fixed, or more commonly, reconfigured to not boot from legacy drives. My system used to HANG on boot when I plugged in ANY USB storage, and that included thumb drives from any vendor. So, as a content WD owner for a decade or more (along with working in an R&D lab for a very large company who manufactured disk arrays using WD drives,) I can only say I've seen VERY few problems with WD. And again, the boot problem is simply not a WD problem.",0,4
9SIA0AJ17D7895,22-136-749,10/26/2012 5:24:14 PM,Autumn E.,WD My Book Essential 3TB External HDD - Quality Product,5," It's Western Digital - A world leader in HDD technology.3TB of space - Reported as 2.72TB. Windows reports TiB (tebibyte) as TB (terabyte), this is normal. 2.72TiB is 3TB. USB 3.0 / 2.0 Nice overall design and aesthetic. Looks good sitting on your desk. Quiet, well ventilated, well built enclosure. 2 year limited warranty at the time of this review. Don't forget to register!I have been a long time ""power user"" of Western Digital HDD's, since the late 1980's. Over that long time span, I have only had a few drives fail on me. To put that in perspective, that's over 20 years of Western Digital HDD usage, and in that time frame I can count the number of drives that failed on me, while in use, on one hand. I am not saying this unit will hold up to my past experience, but it's a pretty good track record in my opinion."," The biggest con I have for this device has nothing to do with the device itself, but the WD Smartware software. The software is easy to use, can run diagnostics on the unit, secure the data on the unit, and things of that nature. However when it comes to automated backups, it falls short. Mainly because you can not select individual files or folders to backup. It scans a drive you select and organizes the data into categories, like pictures, movies, music, movies, mail, documents, and ""other"".  You can then select to backup any or all of those categories, but not any of the individual files or folders within those categories. So you can't pick what you want to backup, it's all or nothing within those specified categories. So you can easily end up with a lot of unwanted data being backed up. I considered knocking off an egg, since people who buy a drive like this, will likely be using it for backups, and automated backups are a key part of that and should be very flexible and configurable. However, I decided not too since this is something that can easily be addressed by Western Digital with a future software update. In fact, right after I submit this review, I am going to suggest it to them.Of course, you can still easily do manual backups, or use other 3rd party backup software if you choose."," Like with most all HDD's, internal and external, it benchmarked higher than it performed under real usage conditions. However, the real numbers I got on my system were still pretty nice to see. On average, a single large file transferred at about 60Mb/s. Large numbers of smaller files transferred at about 35Mb/s. All on USB 3.0. Not bad at all. Of course, take these numbers with a grain of salt since not everyone will get the exact same results. Overall, the speeds are fast and the drive is quick to respond with my system.Basically, this is a Western Digital Caviar Green 3TB HDD in a quality external enclosure.  So it's perfectly suited for this purpose. It does require external power obviously , via a standard AC/DC wall adapter, so make sure you have a place to plug it in. I also connected the unit to the Western Digital MyNetN900 router and it was instantly recognized. So this would make a great network storage and/or media streaming device as well.Right now, I am using the drive to store movies, music, games, disk images, and as a Steam backup drive. It's working fantastic!Overall, I think this is a great product. Nice large capacity, great performance, and quiet. I can find no faults with the hardware. I have not had any issues with the drive at all, and it's been running 24/7 with it sleeping after 10 minutes of inactivity. The WD Smartware software is its only hindrance in my opinion, and it would be an easy fix for Western Digital to add individual file and folder backup selection.",2,3
9SIA0AJ17D7895,22-136-749,10/25/2012 9:46:04 AM,Ben R.,Cons outweigh the Pros,1, 3TB is nice and big but the cons outweigh the pros.," I and many others complain that the drive dissappears from time to time requiring the drive to be power cycled, even with both power setting ""turn off hard drive, never"" and ""USB selective supend, disabled"", very annoying. Also in Windows 7 you get an error writing to the drive while attempting to creat a system image. Both issues are well documented across the internet. I don't experiance either issue with my 1TB My Book.", The power button if thats what its suppose to be doesn't do anything and theres nothing about it on WD web site or in the documentation.,3,5
9SIA0AJ17D7895,22-136-749,10/24/2012 5:29:10 PM,Karen F.,3TB for the Masses,4," Overall this is a wonderful hard drive for what it is, 3TB of storage (2.728 TiB), enough to store ~19,070 episodes (~11 months runtime) of 720p High10 10-bit anime, or ~11.5 years worth of HE-AACv2 stereo music. With that much music, I don't know what would finish first, your playlist or the drive failing? Due to the nature of the size is the mainly for long term storage that isn't moved often. The best part about buying external hard drives is you can easily use them as internal hard drives if you wish to. If you have a USB3 port you won't need to use it internally to get the maximum speed of the drive. The following tests were done on a USB3 port.

For example, the software determines that ALL pictures on the drive must be backed up, or ALL videos on the drive must be backed up, this isn't very efficient.* Bulky unit due to 3TB of platters, consider using internally if you do not need the portability."," For those who are too accustomed to looking at Windows' false capacity readings and wonder why Windows states the drive is 2.73TB instead of 3TB, when a manufacturer states that the drive is 3TB, it is indeed 3TB, Windows reports the Tebibyte (TiB) variant rather than the Terabyte (TB) variant. 3TB converted to TiB is 2.728TiB, which Windows reports as 2.72TB. If you are using Linux, your system already displays the correct formats of TB and TiB. Although the drive's included software sucks, there is plenty of third party tools you may use.",2,2

When you need the drive it's exactly like when you insert a CD/DVD; everything locks up and I have to wait about 10 seconds for spool up and read before I can use it.

They should let the user decide what the cutoff time should be. Maybe there's a hack somewhere? Anyone? The other main problem is I can't work on a lot of the data stored there, so I have to move it to another drive like C or D and do my work, then copy it back. Why I have no idea but I have two of these drives and they're both identical in every way."," The look is clean, but it could be smaller. It's a modern 3-1/2"" drive, not on old 5-1/4.

The WD 2-1/2"" USB drives are awesome looking (and functioning), why can't they make a tight case for this drive as well?

Reproducible with three different USB3 HBA controllers including ASMedia ASM1042, VIA VL800 and a recent Intel chipset.  Someone else on a mailing list confirmed the same problem with a 3.1 kernel and a Mukii enclosure which certainly has the same microcontroller as the MyBook.Same test works perfectly with Rosewill dock that has a ASMedia AS2105 controller and either a 3TB drive (4096 byte sectors) or a 500GB drive (512 byte sectors).  The other person also fixed the issue with a different USB3-to-SATA enclosure."," Reported bug to WD.  If they confirm a fix at some point in the future the drive is probably ok then, but you're better off stuffing a bare drive in a non-WD enclosure.  Mukii enclosures have WD controllers so skip those--I'd stick with Rosewill since the chipset is known.Note that if you are not careful to align logical 4k block with 4k physical sectors the drive will run slower an this may hide the problem.  Be sure configure the drive with no partition table or to use 'parted' to force proper sector alignment (i.e. multiples of eight 512 byte sectors).",4,6

It doesn't hurt to make the connection panel a bit bigger to fit the B plug, there is still plenty of room for ventilation- Also, to take advantage of the 64MB cache memory (and the power of USB3), you need to set the drive policy from ""quick removal"" to ""better performance"" to get the top speed, otherwise will be just be a little bit faster than USB2, but not a lot. When you use this mode, make sure there is nothing transferring before you use plug the drive out- I use genie backup manager to do backup jobs instead of the smartware, so can't comment much on the software other than able to use the power button",13,13

The speed I get with USB 3.0 is wonderful, the performance you would expect from 3.0. Depending if I'm transferring a lot of files or just one big one I usually see it between 120MB/s and 220MB/s.First drive was bad, but the RMA is very simple and they provide the option to send the drive to you first, and they don't even ask what's wrong with it. Although, you do have to provide a credit card number so you don't take their drive without returning the old one."," My first drive caused any somewhat large file that was put on it to become corrupt. It took me a little while before I realized it but sure enough the CRCs wouldn't match and the file would be useless. The Seagate tools that you can get from their website didn't show anything wrong with the drive, so make sure to check your file for corruption when transferring. I now always use TeraCopy to verify that  file have been transferred properly and so far so good with the new drive I received.Also a small con is that you have to plug it into the wall, but that is pretty much unavoidable when dealing with larger hard drives.", Overall I am happy with this drive!,8,8

Look good on the desktop., Drives not reliable due to lack of proper USB 3.0 Drivers for Win7 64 bit.  It's a known issue with these Seagate drives and other USB 3.0 devices.  Do a quick search and you'll find info.  See here for an answer/possible solution from MSFT: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/817900," Bought 2 of these - both worked fine for a week -- then my USB3.0 ports stopped recognizing the 2 drives.  Called Seagate, did some research.  There is a known driver issue relating to USB 3.0.  The problem may be related to sleep mode settings.  Disabling the Selective Suspend Mode in power settings under USB prior to installing the drives may help.  Bottom line -- this drive will not be a reliable USB 3.0 solution until Microsoft updates the drivers.  Seagate should not be selling this as a plug and play solution until this issue is resolved.   I purchased these drives for work, and will have to stop using them until I see a driver update for USB 3.0 devices.  Disabling the selective sleep mode and never putting your pc to sleep may help you avoid this issue from occurring.",7,13

Quiet., 1 Year Warranty," 3 TB 3.5"" external drives seem to be the sweet spot right now for gigabyte:dollar. I picked this up during a Black Friday sale for $30 a terabyte, a fantastic value. This is my first USB 3 mass storage device, so of course I benchmarked it. I got 194 MB/s sequential reads and 135 MB/s sequential writes. To put that in perspective, that's more than double the read speeds of my Sandybridge laptop's internal 5400 RPM drive. Very impressive. It has been running quiet and cool even during large (500 GB) file transfers.The only negatives I have are niggles, really. I would feel better if the warranty was longer than 1 year (a major competitor warranties their comparable drives for 2 years). The wall wart covers 2 outlets on my already overcrowded power strip. After I registered it on Seagate's website, I checked to see if there were any firmware updates available, which there wasn't. I downloaded Seatools or Windows (which is actually a decent program I have used before. spoiler: it works with other brands of drives too) and something called Seagate Drive Settings for the Expansion series drives. It is supposed to allow you to change the sleep settings, toggle the activity light, and run diagnostics. It would install in Windows 8.1, but wasn't able to detect the drive. I tried running it in compatibility mode for Windows 7 and even XP, but it still wouldn't recognize the drive. Oh well, it did sound cool, but I can't be disappointed that something I didn't even know existed wouldn't work.A hard drive is most likely to fail when it's brand new.

The heat! This drive gets pretty warm. It idles around 50 C which can't be good for the longevity of any HD. My other internal HD's are all around the 30-35 C range. As mentioned above, the drive didn't quite perform as fast as i had expected for something with USB 3.0.

There are no holes at the top of the enclosure to allow trapped heat to escape via convection cooling.Heat is the silent killer of hard drives and this drive WILL fail due to the enclosure's horrible design and lack of proper ventilation if it just sits there on the desk without forced ventilation.," Buy the drive and toss the enclosure, consider it extra packing material to put in the recycle bin.Removing the drive from it's enclosure will void your warrantee but do you expect them to last forever?  Back up your data on a regular basis because no matter the brand, make or model, ALL hard drives will eventually fail.  It's never fun when a drives fails but if you have a backup of the data on that drive, it greatly reduces the sting.I have purchased at least 8 RX-358 series drive enclosures from Newegg over the years and they have been absolutely great. The first one I bought many years ago still works just fine today with regular cleaning of the fan.As for Seagate, we'll see if this new 3TB drive stands the test of time, if it dies, it won't be due to the Rosewill enclosure it's housed in.When I had originally posted this review, Newegg staff had interpreted my review as a plea for help and to their credit, they were quite willing to assist me and issue an RMA for the drives and / or give me a refund.  I'm happy with my purchase and plan on keeping them.  With proper cooling and not being bumped around, I expect years of service from these drives.I deducted 2 eggs, no fault of Newegg but for the horrible enclosure design.",7,10

Wow - how cheap can the case/connector be?!, Based on bad reviews I'm assuming it's the case that's poor quality so I'm hopeful I can just pull the drive out and have a good 3TB drive. That was my plan actually because this was so inexpensive. But it's probably not worth the risk in retrospect.,1,2

9SIA3TB1HF4859,22-178-117,9/2/2013 7:18:58 PM,William W.,How To Use This Product,1, cheap on sale," I bought 2 of these over a year ago, used them for 2 or 3 weeks, filled them up with backup data and unplugged them.  One of them had been DOA & RMA'd & replaced with a new one that worked.  Well, after trying to access my backup data, guess what, BOTH of them were electrically dead - bricked!!!  They were out of warranty, so I popped open the first case and put the drive into a desktop system.  Drive was A-OK, but was showing up as MBR (2TB) format rather than GPT.  That meant I couldn't access my backup data - the drive presented as 3TB when it was working.  And Windows won't let me switch the drive to GPT without first deleting all partitions (and thus deleting all my backup data).  Seagate's enclosure controller card must be doing the 3TB ""translation"".  Got a multimeter and tested the power bricks - both were fully functional.  The point of failure is thus the enclosure's controller card.  So in order to get my backup data, I had to buy another unit just so I could get a working controller card to pull my backup data from the old drive.  These controller cards are apparently short-lived & very unreliable."," Correct way to use this product is to test it once as an external drive just to ensure that the drive is working, then crack open the enclosure, pull out the drive, install it in a desktop, convert it to GPT, then format and use it thereafter as a desktop internal hard drive.  Do not, I repeat DO NOT, rely on this enclosure as an external storage device!!!!!",18,18

No problems so far."," Nothing worth losing an egg, just cosmetic differences between the two supposedly Identical drives.The 2 drives I received are actually slightly different visually. They have the same model numbers and manu. dates but they are obviously visually different drives but only on the bottoms. They both work the same so I guess it's not really a con. The enclosures themselves are actually a joke. Very chincy plastic with no screws just little clips. Virtually no ventilation. a Few holes in the bottom but the solid metal shield that the drive sits in makes those useless with no fan. The enclosures themselves were also different on the inside. One has holes in the metal shield and the other doesn't. They also use different screws to hold the drive. One has big head screws the other are like barrel head screws."," If you're just looking for bare drives this is the way to go for sure.

The process to remove the casing only required a screw driver and a few minutes, but this was done after running multiple passes with badblocks and various S.M.A.R.T. tests.  During testing, it was noted that there were random bad sectors found, and while it was initially thought that it was just the motherboard's USB 3.0 controller being taxed, these would pop up even when individual drives were being scanned; some passes would be flawless and others would report back bad sectors.  Upon removing drives from their enclosures and connecting them to the SATA board, there were no further problems found.  Hence the four eggs.Otherwise, I haven't ran across any issues with these drives.  For the price and speed ($33/TB), they were well worth it, and after setting them up in a RAID-Z, I really haven't had to play around with them which is a very good thing.",1,1

No DOA.Decent transfer speeds, but not stellar (see other).Specialty cable (USB 3.0 Micro B to USB 3.0 A) cable is a decent length ( ~46"" ) unlike others that have 18"" cables.The actual hard drive is made in Thailand, which according to most reviewers is far more reliable than their siblings from China.  Fingers crossed.  Remember, RAID is your best friend when it comes to hard drives, especially big ones."," The actual model number of the hard drive in this enclosure is ST3000DM001.  If you look that part number up here, you will see 182 out of 779 (23%) scathing (1 egg) reviews and 340 (44%) 5 egg reviews.  The case is a joke.  This is a sealed hard drive coffin.  For intermittent use, you will probably be fine, but I can see this thing cooking itself in no time under extended periods of heavy use (like formatting, for example).  The funniest part is that the back and bottom plastic case are covered in holes (you can see the holes in the back in the product pictures), but once you take the plastic shell off, you find that the back and bottom of the drive is wrapped in a solid sheet metal case that completely covers all of the holes!  The drive is also not in contact with any of the plastic case, so it has no means of transferring heat to the outside.  This poor drive gets no cooling whatsoever.Another really interesting feature is that the hard drive isn't actually attached to the case.  So if you turn the case over, you will literally hear a thump as the drive hits the top of the case.  Very strange....To give you an idea how bad this case is, Seagate offers a 2 year warranty on the bare drive that is in this case, but only a 1 year warranty if you buy it packaged in this case.  They know it will never last..."," How sad is it that you can buy this external drive for significantly less that the same hard drive separately ($100 for this, $135 for the same bare drive)?At least the case is pretty easy to get open, which is what I was counting on.  So you can pull the disks and mount them internally.  Here's the trick:  Turn the case upside down and use a knife to pry loose the 3 latches at the front and back.  Just pry enough to hear them pop loose (maybe 1/8"").

If you get them from Newegg on sale, the price is the same as buying the bare drive on sale.  You get the enclosure and power supply for free.   It is hard to beat that.The drives run quiet and reasonably cool. I mount them on the side so there is maximum surface area for radiative and convective cooling.   Since there are no fans, the noise level from these drives is very low, almost silent.  I have these running as a replaceable backup storage on a server to provide me with switchable backups that can be moved off-site.  As such, the drives run 24/7.   So far, I have had no failures.   Measured power consumption is 4-5 watts at idle and 11-12 watts under 100% load.   This is as low as any drive I have measured.The 3TB drives are very fast.   I measured maximum instantaneous transfer speeds of as high as 300MB/sec  with average transfer speeds of 180MB/sec for a 8Gb file transferring over a USB 3.0 port.  This was 15% faster than the 2Tb version of this drive and at least 25% faster than the 4TB version which spins at 5900 rpm.   All the Seagate drives are faster than WD Red HDD's. The HDD used in the Seagate Expansion Drive is the fastest HDD I have measured to date (I have not tested any 10,000rpm HDD's).I cannot speak to long term reliability for these drives other than to state that I own many WD, Seagate, Hitachi, and Toshiba HDD's.   So far, I have not had a failure.  Because of the Low cost (I got some on sale for $109 with free shipping), low noise, and high data transfer speeds, I would highly recommend this drive.

I blink two or three times and it's ready.Had no issues with the drive going to sleep while transferring loads of date (about an hour for one dump).Overall I like these."," Wall wart isn't a side saddle, so if you have a traditional ""strip"" surge protector it'll probably cover the plug(s) around it.

Sure enough it choked on installing this drive when I plugged it into a USB port.  I then installed the USB drivers from the MB manf (Intel) website and the drive works fine (with dreary 2.0 speeds, but it works).An ancient operating system, on an ancient hardware platform and everything works fine once the correct drivers (which btw are ancient too) are installed.Stop automatically blaming Seagate and MS...if you installed a new graphics card, NIC, or printer you'd go to the companys website and download the latest drivers rather than use that 6 month old disc of drivers (at least I hope you would).  So why are you using generic drivers that are a couple years old?  The first thing we do in my IT support section when pulling a new system out of the box is go to the MB manf website to get the latest bios/drivers.  Anyone familiar with the infamous Dell laptop bouncing trackpad issue?  Yeah, that happens when using the MS generic drivers....it gets fixed when the Dell specific drivers are installed.  It'll take you all of 10 minutes to go to a website/install drivers/and reboot for you to see if it fixes things with your USB port...even if you installed them back when you got your system, check for updates.Out of curiosity I looked through these reviews, and don't think I saw a single person comment that they went to their MB manf website to get the latest USB drivers to troubleshoot (sorry if I missed someone who actually did).
