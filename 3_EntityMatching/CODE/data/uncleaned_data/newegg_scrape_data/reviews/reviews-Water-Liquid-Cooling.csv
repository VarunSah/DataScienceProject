The construction feels sturdy and there are a total of 7 drain-fill ports. Dual LED place holders (no LED included) which allows you to have 2 colors showing the fill level of the reservoir (I used blue for the water level and red for the empty space)," All the threads for the fittings are some sort of plastic. I don't like screwing metal fittings into plastic. You can easily strip the thread and have to MacGyver a solution to get it to work again (don't ask me how I know that).The design is odd. I fought for 4 hours trying to get this pump/reservoir combo working without luck. Only after contacting support and being told that I basically have to fill my entire water cooling system before the pump will work I got it to work. The problem with that is my radiator sits on top of the case and the pump sits below in the 5,25 bay. Therefore I can never get water filled into the entire system (through the reservoir) without moving the case on it's back and moving it in circles to flush out air, while making sure nothing leaks out - WHAT A PAIN! My old pump/reservoir combo had no such issues ( I filled water into the reservoir, turned it on and it did the rest).", I don't think I would buy this again if I had a choice.

Holds a decent amount of water.  Mounts easily to 140 or 120mm fan mounting points.  Several options for in and out flow routing.  Acetal material feels high quality, and the wall of the reservoir tube is thick and durable feeling."," LED holder caps are fragile and can crack and leak.  I had an LED holder cap fail on my previous XSPC pump/res and leak on me.  Luckily I had a spare (they included one in the box for some suspicious reason) and with the reservoir mounted at the bottom of my case, it just leaked onto the floor where I have a plastic mat.  Anyways, the pump eventually failed so I replaced it with what I thought would be a better reservoir, this one.  However, within a few weeks of setting it up (and leaving it run unattended while I left for Christmas) I came back to a half empty reservoir and green crud all over the bottom of my case as it leaked out a ton of fluid and eventually my PC overheated due to lack of flow.  The culprit was the plastic LED holder end cap, which had cracked along the thread allowing water to leak out.  I tried filling it up and leak testing and it just leaked it all out again, so I pulled the cap out and sure enough, split clean around the threads."," Luckily, I had some spare metal caps from my GPU waterblock that fit the same hole size as the plastic LED caps.  I removed both for good measure and threw them in the trash where they belong.  The metal ones fit tightly and don't show any signs of leaking after a week of use.I seriously don't understand it.  I'll be the first to admit that LED lighting looks awesome.  I have my desk decked out in RGB peripherals and light strips.  However, a reservoir's prime objective is simple - hold water, don't leak.  If you build it with parts that compromise those objectives you're doing it wrong.  Thin weak plastic is a horrible material for building screw in threads out of, as if you overtighten them they crack, if you don't tighten enough they leak.  The hole for the LED further compromises their structural integrity.  I despise those stupid LED holders.  Please Alphacool, at least throw in two extra metal caps so we can replace those horrible plastic things with durable metal ones before accidents happen.I'm happy with what I have now, but I wish I didn't have to clean up a huge mess to find out what modification I needed to make to get to this point.  Luckily I still mounted it below all my components because if it's going to leak, it's best to leak on the floor than on my expensive parts.",None,None

9SIA85V3SS0908,2YM-000P-00003,7/31/2016 3:19:11 PM,Lynn B.,"Simple, compact and stylish AIO",4," This AIO is really on the level of an open loop cooling system given the high quality Apogee XL waterblock and the addition of a reservoir that allows you to check the water quality and to see if any air bubbles are forming in the coolant.The tubing is flexible and difficult to kink, and even with my compact setup the excess tubing was manageable. Also the black atheistic of the tubing, radiator and block will likely not clash with many case's colorschemes. The system itself was moderately easy to refill or top off and burp, though little room was left for adding dyes or what you may need, so expect a little air if you drain some of the coolant  without properly topping it off and burping any air out.The waterblock has an LED backlight that comes with 4 different colors to choose from, white, blue, green and red, to help accent a few common colorschemes found throughout component manufacturers.- it's worth mentioning that these are physical plates that need to be interchanged and not some sort of color changing LEDs as like what is found in the reservoirs of Swiftech's X2 line of AIOsFor a 140mm class radiator, its seems to do very well at rejecting heat in the stock push-fan setup, though the fins are more spread apart compared to what I'm used to. While cooling a G3258 overclocked to 4.9 GHz at stupid high voltages, I was able to run prime 95 for a few hours without core temps going over an average of 74C, and the radiator itself was no warmer than 40C to the touch. This performance is likely due to the unexpected airflow I got out of the Swiftech Helix 140 PWM fan, which is rated for about 90 cfm at full tilt, which I personally find to be incredibly quiet for the amount of air it claims it can move.- I intend to upgrade this to a noctua NF-A14 3000 PWM fan once I start testing with my 4690K and 4790K processors around 5 GHz, just for added performance in cooling the limited amount of coolant in the system (about 7-8oz from when I cleaned mine out)."," First and foremost, when I got this AIO I was appalled at what I saw in the reservoir, what looked to be a full coating of algae on everything visible even most of the viewing window. Upon emptying the contents the waterblock was gunked up and the coolant came out an off-red/brownish color. I believe it's supposed to be clear.- I had purchased this unit directly through swiftech, so if anyone else gets one in such condition, don't blame newegg or whoever the seller may be and call swiftech if you are not comfortable changing the coolant and cleaning the block and don't want to void any warranties (there are lots of videos on cleaning waterblocks throughout youtube and please be advised to not allow much contact with skin or tap water and any of the copper and also disassembly does void the warranty as far as I can tell)The Apogee XL waterblock was my main reason for purchasing this setup and performed well, noticeably better than the Apogee HD, but its material quality is a huge step down form the HD. Though LED lights and swiveling barbs are nice, they don't make up for the cheap plastic that most of the block seems to be made out of. When removing the baseplate I was shocked to find tapered wood screws coming out of block and not machine screws.When I went to reassemble the block I found that no two screws set themselves in the same despite being all the same length, and I even managed to strip two out which was a pain and a half to repair (I suggest using plastic weld to fill the hole and retapping it with the screw and a bit of elbow grease) - This is fine for an AIO, but the swiftech HXX0-X series is really great for being upgradable systems which always spells out the need to clean the loop from time to time, and I cannot suggest the XL is a good block for such demands. Perhaps the Apogee XL2 found in the H2X0-X2 or H320-X2 might be a better option, but it looks to also be made mostly out of acrylic.The reservoir also doesn't allow for a push-pull fan set up to be run since it and the pump take up a third of the area under the radiator and seem to create some deadzones for airflow.One last little nit-pick I had with the system is the coloration. Two, of the four, color plates glow slightly off; the green being a bit spring-green/yellowish and the red being a bit orange in color, noticeably so even to a guy who has a hard time discerning red from red-orange. These plates may also stick inside a bit and can be tricky to pull out, that or I missed some tool to aid in the process. Also the reservoir LED color is white, no changing that at all without using some really potent dies, the red coolant I added to my system is almost unnoticeable and looks clear."," One comment I need to make is on the size of the waterblock, it's big, not compact like what you find on a corsair AIO, so theres a lot more surface area for cooling, but this might lead to some fitment issues. I wasn't able to run direct die cooling since the plate ran into the caps surrounding the processor, but I think this will be a non-issue for most but may pose some fitment issues on smaller motherboards with the use of RAM with heatsinks or additional coolers.I would suggest buying an H220-X(2) or H240-X(2) if your case has the room, just simply because of the ability to run part of the radiator as a push-pull setup and leave less deadzones.That being said, if you're looking for a good method to cool a 105-140W processor you won't be overclocking or for a good starting point in a custom loop but want to jump right to watercooling your system before working out all the rads, blocks, tubing, mounting and other components then I think you will do well to purchase this AIO.One last note, the radiator is tall and the tubes don't go directly into it, so some adjustments may need to be made to prevent kinking in tight setups. I, personally, mounted the radiator directly to the case's grill with the fan on top on the outside of the case.",2,2

Tube bending took some time but isn't all that hard.," The C1000 Coolant seperated and clogged up the CPU Waterblock and the pump to the point that now the pump itself sounds like its cavitating, its definitely struggling and its very loud now.  If you put your finger on the CPU waterblock you could feel a huge vibration from the coolant die that had seperated clogging the small fins inside the waterblock.  Very unhappy that I had to spend all this time to break down my loop and backlush everything to try to get the gunk out of all the parts.  Now the pump is still loud so not sure how much longer that will last."," the loop itself works fine,  The pump works fine as well,  My bad review is to the Coolant that it says to use.

This thing knocks the socks off the corsair H110i I had on my i7 5820k.For comparison - on the H110i with the 5820k overclocked to 4.3GHZ temps peaked at 76c on my chip. With the X360 I have yet to see over 60c.  The H110i sounded like a jet engine. This thing is whisper silent. It's PWM - all of it (except the pump, it can run PWM signal, but is molex powered).

I found that it was cracked before it leaked all over my graphics card."," The Acrylic that makes up the body is cracked on 3 of the 4 sides. This occurred since 10/15 when I bought it, and today is 1/16 exactly 90 days after purchase. This also has had very little use. It was installed late October on a PC that I was rebuilding. The MB was faulty and had to be replaced. This Triton was only operated for less than an hour and sat idle till today. I finally got around to putting my PC back together and this is what I have to show for it. It is useless since its bulging. So there was no excessive heat from the CPU, or any over tightening or any other excuse."," I wanted to like this Triton. Unfortunately the acrylic used in my unit wasn't up to the task of NOT cracking. I don't recommend this product for that reason.

N82E16835146058,35-146-058,3/1/2017 9:19:36 PM,Anonymous,Best RGB Liquid Cooler EVER!,5," - Software Controlled RGB lighting is clearly the reason anyone would buy this liquid cooling system. It does not disappoint! The 8 LED's are very bright and are each able to be individually set to whatever color you want. There's plenty of special effects available to customize this lighting with through the CAM software. It even has the ability to change color based on CPU or GPU temperature (Logo can display one and the ring can display the other if you want to see both at the same time!) or based on FPS in a game being played. It can also sync with audio coming from your computer in three different ways; Level, Sync, and Bass. This is all in addition to many preset lighting effects as well. The infinite mirror design enhances the LED ring a lot and makes it much cooler looking.- Pump & Fans are able to be monitored and controlled using the CAM software as well. You can setup notifications if something fails or if temperatures get too hot. There's preset ""Silent Mode"" and ""Performance Mode"", or you can set the fan or pump to stay at a certain speed. You can take it a step further and customize what speeds the pump and fans should change to at each 5 degree Celsius interval (You can choose the liquid temp, CPU temp, or GPU temp for it to follow).- Long tubes are a blessing. They allow you to route them out of the way of your RAM or other components that may have lighting effects of their own. Definitely long enough for top mounting the radiator, and most likely long enough for front intake mounting as well. Check the dimensions before you order, and remember the fan will add an inch to the radiator (2 inches if using fans on both sides of the radiator).- Pump is quiet, can't hear it over the sound of my other case fans. Included fan for radiator is quiet unless running at 100%.- Came with thermal paste applied, no need to apply yourself. I bought some Arctic Silver 5 to redo it myself eventually, since a lot of people don't recommend using the thermal paste already installed on the cooler.- Delivered safely packaged by both Newegg and NZXT, no damage to report.- 6 Year Warranty!"," - The nylon sleeve over the tubing is very easy to snag on parts inside the case, resulting in pulled out pieces. Be very careful to avoid doing this. I was already fully aware of this from another review I read and I still accidentally snagged one little spot while installing it.- The pump is on the larger side for sure. The RGB lighting adds height to it and it's wider too. It literally just fits snug next to my RAM sticks. I have all 4 slots used, if you're only using 2 sticks of RAM you should have no problem at all fitting this pump in.- Lots of cables to plug in for this to work right! In the back of the pump itself you have 1) USB 2.0 to control the RGB lighting 2) Main power cable, which splits off into 3 separate cables that need plugged in elsewhere. You need a SATA power connection, a CPU_FAN connection, and the third cable is to power & control the fans. I managed to keep all these cables very well hidden, but it was a challenge."," Overall I totally recommend this liquid cooler! Would buy it again for sure, no regrets. RGB lighting is amazing, and the monitoring/control software is great. 6 year warranty too! NOTE: My NZXT logo is perfectly straight, not tilted like another reviewer mentioned theirs is.",1,1

I don't know if it's because I mounted it in a rotated position (but I checked, so maybe not?), but my NZXT logo is not ""straight"". It's at like a 5 degree angle, instead of being parallel with the desk.Oh well; I got around this problem by turning off the NZXT logo LED, and instead just messing around with the Ring LED profiles.

No, I did not run the tower like that. I reloaded the 2.2 GHz in bios after testing :) This cooler solution has dropped idle temp to 30 C (over clocked) with a relatively heavy graphics load on a gtx 1050ti, the temp peaks at 56 C. I should have been using water cooling a long time ago!Cooler arrived in 11 days. Coming from China, not too bad.This IS a closed loop solution.The pump does come with thermal paste pre-applied.The entire assembly is easy to maneuver in the tower.The pump comes with a 4 - pin connector. Be sure your mobo can support this.The neon blue light on the fan matches perfectly with my color scheme.Breather RGB light is a nice touch, wish it matched the blue on the fan. That would be icing on the cake. It is white.This far exceeded my expectations. Water cooling is the way to go!!"," After the part cleared customs, tracking indicated it would be delivered in a different state half way across the country. Attempts to contact the seller went unanswered. - HOWEVER, newegg customer service assisted in contacting the seller and it turned out to be an error in the tracking info. I'm not taking an egg from them over this. But this was my first overseas shipment and I was nervous ordering from china to begin with. That didn't help. The part arrived the next day.The pump mounting system needs a good deal of re-engineering. You MUST have a second set of hands to mount this, or be a mechanical engineer to invent a bracing method on-the-fly. The backboard has several issues; the retaining caps that are designed to hold the offsets in place are a rigid, frangible plastic that breaks when you install them. I threw them away. The backboard does not mount in any fashion to the mobo. It will just sit there until you put the pump in place and start to tighten the finger screws down. Now you're into the 2nd set of hands requirement. 1 hand on the pump. 1 hand on the backboard. 1 hand putting/holding offsets in place to tighten the finger screws and finally 1 hand tightening the finger screws. Woof!! Two people with patience can do this without too much difficulty but it does take some coordination. Lastly, the backboard itself.You can identify this in the overview picture. It is the metal square with 8 arms. This next part may just be the way my brain works. They stamped ""Intel"" and ""AMD"" onto each side of the plate. My brain says, align this so ""intel"" can be read and that is the proper alignment. NOPE...backwards. For intel sockets, you have to turn ""intel"" so it is in contact with the mobo. If you have it the other way, you will not have enough threads on the offset to install the thumb screws. Definitely taking 1 egg for this.This instruction pamphlet is a picto-gram. No actual instruction. A parts list and a couple of arrows at critical junctures. An experienced builder won't have much trouble with the directions. The inexperienced builder may scratch their head a few times.This solution is designed to be a discharge system. That is; it pushes air from the case, through the radiator and out to the room. I could have reversed the fan/radiator orientation to change that, but would have hidden the led on the fan. The design does allow you to do that. My build does not generate enough heat to make this critical. So I will not take an egg for this."," I know I harped on the design flaws quite a bit but, overall, I am extremely happy with this product. I would not recommend this at this point in time only due to the design issues. I stand by the 4 egg rating as it does what it supposed to do and it does it very well.***To Deepcool*** If you have any hope of retaining any market share with H2O cooling, you MUST redesign the mounting system.",1,1

So am asking to return it. Not sure if it is the dye that they use to get the green color is causing the growth of fungus, but I did not see any additive that would have been an antifungal growth inhibitor. Also, the tubing seems way too short for my system, as the position of the logo requires the water block to be turned a 90 degree angle. Raijintek should make the logo flexible so that is can be rotated to a new position.", Not sure if I can recommend this product as it seems defective right out of the box. I would like to be able to buy the system without the fans as I have already purchased lime green fans to be used with the radiator. I am hoping that I can substitute standard automotive antifreeze and distilled water for the liquid that Raijintek provided.

While the corsair and other AIOs are extremely loud at high rpm/loads.-Price is pretty fair when considering the cost of a custom loop with similar hardware. You are paying about the same cost as a custom loop using the same/similar parts."," -They charge for AM4 bracket, while it should be provided for free, like almost every other cooler manufacturer does...-It is more difficult to install than other AIOs, but that's to be expected since its basically a pre-assembled custom loop. If you are not very experienced at mounting cpu coolers and radiators, I highly recommend having a second person help you to hold the radiator while installing.-Does not contain a quick drain port like the EKWB AIO custom loop (however that one is $100 more expensive), but a quick drain would make filling and draining much easier to do, which I think would really benefit this product since its main purpose is ""ease of use"" vs a full custom loop. I would definitely pay a little more for that convenience.-Cheap fittings. I know they purposely use cheaper fitting on this model because they want to make the prestige version more relevant. But I still think this should have used decent compression fittings. I didn't buy the prestige because I didn't want to pay extra for fans I was not going to use."," At launch the X2 line did have an issue with the PWM splitter (which is also used to connect LEDs). It was addressed by swiftech as a problem with loose/extra solder causing shorts. It should be fixed by now, but it also wouldn't hurt to open the splitter and just check to make sure there isn't anything obvious that may cause problems before plugging it in)Another thing people say about it is it leaking.

It is packaged very well, includes an additional bottle of coolant for mainenance/top off, and the directions are actually well written and easy to follow. Lepa made installing this AIO simple. This thing is pretty much ready to go. Pump is actually quiet and would have worked out really well - probably make less noise than the included radiator fans."," I ended up RMA-ing the first unit received because the pump was DOA and there was white contamination/slimey sludge in the system. This slimey white stuff most likely got into the pump and prevented it from rotating. The second unit is being returned for a full refund. I knew exactly what to look for this time so a decision was made within thie first 30 seconds of opening the package. The pump was functional but again there was contamination within the system which prevented the pump from moving coolant throughout the system. After about two minutes of trying to purge air from the radiator and into the fill port area the pump began making unusual noises but continued functioning. If it actually pumped like it should have I maybe would have cleaned it all out, reassembled everything, and installed it."," I would not recommend this product as there is a chance that it will arrive defective. You will have to spend money to ship the product back to the merchant and delay your build projects. I wish I could post pics of what I found inside this thing. Lepa has not returned my messages after two attemps. The transparent tubing allowed me to inspect for contaminants before installation. Maybe that's why some of the reviews for many other coolers are stating that pumps are arriving DOA, high CPU temps, and failures of brand new products.Two Eggs for the concept and construction, two eggs because two of these arrived with the SAME defect, but FIVE eggs for Newegg being really simple to work with.",None,None

I used the whole thing of red dye to give it a nice blood red look. Looks like my PC is being cooled with Blood. Added LED lighting and red LED fans to make everything popout real nice. Stressed and benched the CPU and Temps never exceed 55C. I used red 120 MM corsair fans instead of the Lepa Fans and this thing is awesome. I am using an i5 4670K Processor and it makes my PC fly. I almost upgraded to Skylake but bought this to overclock my CPU and with my NEW GTX 1070 Im good for another 3-4 years. All games play at Max and ultra settings 60+ FPS., Maintenance: From time to time you have to add in more cooling fluid but they supply you with a year or 2 supply so no biggie. They give you a power adapter and a container to attach to avoid spills., This is definately worth a buy if you want to custom your PC with a cool added look.

About $6.- Good Temps- Fans are OK- Not just for looks, easier to tell if the pump has failed or not compared to other closed systems that do not have clear tubing.- Easier to detect bubbles in the tubing, hence the clear tubing.", - Must use quite a bit of coloring to actually make a darker version of the color. They give you quite a small amount.-Must Refill the coolant to stay above the coolant line every 3-5 weeks. Not so bad.

I am surprised that the Fans are not noisy and they push a lot of air through the radiator. The hoses are flexible and durable with no problems installing CPU cooler. The Design have a nice simple appearance look., The thermal paste that came applied on the cooler was not great because it made my CPU get up to 80C on idle., I upgraded from a Corsair H60 and cooling a i7 2600K @ 3.4Ghz. My previous temperature according to RealTemp was at the low 40's on idle and high 60's on load. Now my temps dropped to low 30's on idle and low 60's on load in the same time keeping my Motherboard cool. I installed it on a MATX case which had no problem with flexible hose.

This is with 2x Noctua NF-A14's @ 700 RPM. A NH-D15 & Cryorig R1 both bounced around 72C during the same test with fans around 1000RPM.-Simple and easy install, includes the regular Cryorig backplate that's used on all their coolers. For X99 it's literally 4 nuts and 4 thumb screws on top and you're done."," -Pump is obnoxiously loud. It whines/rattles and is by far the loudest thing in my PC.-Chattering annoying fan on top of the pump. Why does this need to spin at 1500RPM idling? At max speed (3000RPM), it's unbearable. Your motherboard VRM area doesn't require Star extinguishing cooling potential.-Removing the fan on the pump to ditch the noise leaves you with a disgusting looking bare pump top.-Included 140mm fans that they advertise as HLPN Bearings are just fancy sleeve bearings, if you mount this horizontally expect noise. The included fans tick and make bad motor noise in this orientation. Worse yet they only go down to 600RPM and are far too loud without a custom fan profile to keep them below 1000RPM."," Here is the main issue, you cannot control the pump nor the fan on top of the pump individually.The Pump has 3 cables coming out of it. -PWM fan cable with the 12v wire removed -2 way PWM splitter for the 2 included fans-Sata cable to power the pump and fans attached to the splitter. Essentially the speeds of the Pump and Fan on top of the Pump are dictated by whatever PWM fan you connect to the first plug of the PWM fan splitter (the one that actually has 4 pins). Everything ramps up or down with whatever fan is connected there based on your motherboards fan control or Asus AI Suite for example. The PWM fan plug with only 3 wires that comes out of the pump only exists to report PWM duty to your motherboard and the pumps firmware adjusts everything else based on your fan profile. So when plugged in the only RPM reading you get is of the fan plugged into the 4 pin PWM fan splitter.This means I have no control of the Pump RPM, which is way too loud even when I set my fans to 10% but it also means the fan on top of the CPU is always going ham even when idling.This is a acceptable setup for those who like plug and play, but based on the reputation Cryorig has built with their air coolers I expected more control and silence. Competing AIO's use software (CAM or Corsair LINK) to avoid the above issues, as garbage as those pieces of software are, at least they allow you to set your desired setting and then never reopen again as it's saved to the pumps firmware.",12,19

But still the same issue plus one of the tower tubes to the pump is shorter than the other making it difficult to put it in other positions in any case, on the back exhaust port the tubes will rest on the gpu putting force on it and the pciex16 slot, placing it on top will not allow you to have two exhausts fans because the rad is an awkward size. And you can't use it with two fans because it overlaps the board too much and pushes on your CPU power connector cables. Can't mount it to the front because one tube is not long enough. This becomes a problem as it is very awkward for positioning in any case you buy.", I had a previous review where I said I found no issues however after months of use and being annoyed at the positioning issues I have come across I had to write another review. I tried to find a way to edit the last one however I couldn't. My suggestion to anyone buying this cooler is that if you want it to look nice and function this is not the cooler for you. This cooler will keep your CPU frosty and will work fantastically regardless of whether you have it set up with 2 fans or 1. However it's awkward sizing and it's one short cooling tube there is no way to position this cooler to make it look nice and to keep it from causing strain on the motherboard or GPU.,None,None

The small plastic container that was suppose to have all the parts nice and organized was empty and there were screws all over the place.

I have it installed on an i7 6700k using arctic silver 5 compound. After a little adjusting in the BIOS, I keep this beast cpu around 22-25c idle and have never seen past 56-60c in ultra/maxed out settings in modern games/gaming.

It's usually a wind tunnel in my game room in the summer with no central A/C and three fans on blast all day lol. This baby is dead silent even at high RPMs. Once the cooler weather started and the house fans turned off, I almost thought this thing was broke! That quiet! Blue LED located in the lower right of the pump is really cool because my new build is a black and dark neon blue LED theme anyway, goes perfect with it. Never seems to get hot, at all....like anywhere. The pump, hoses, radiator, etc. never feels even warm to the touch, not sure if it's my towers 3x 200mm fans or just a great quality product."," Not too bad here. There is difficulty in adjusting hoses to sit properly in your tower without too much flex or force on the bend of the hose. There were times where I felt I was or it was going to brake/it. Don't let it discourage you, you'll find the sweet spot eventually where it sits perfect with minimal flex with the adjustable range they have. I would NOT recommend under full atx size towers for this unless you can top mount the exhaust, this sucker takes up a decent bit in my full. Either way, do your homework as needed before purchasing parts. Also, the stock fan settings in the BIOS wasn't cutting it for cpu to idle at a ""normal"" temp. Low RPMs in the 6-800 range on default/auto on my i7 6700k was idling around 35c or more, not kosher for me. Made my own custom dynamic setting where it automatically adjusts as needed to keep idling from 22-27c and ultra/maxed out gaming at 1080p no higher than high 50c/60c. Max RPMs are 2000, my custom setting doesn't reach over 1600 RPMs. Not thrilled about needing the higher settings to achieve preferred level of cooling, but it's worth a $100 replacement to keep my $340 investment cool, crisp and running like a champ for the next 4-5 years ;)"," Blue LED in pump cannot be turned off, nor is it rgb/adjustable.

However, this was my first computer build that I've done completely by myself and I got it figured out, so it must not be that bad. I did need an extra set of hands for a minute to hold things while I tightened the screws. It keeps my 6700K at about 60C most of the time while gaming; 30C at idle."," I got this because it came as part of a package deal with the Corsair Obsidian 250D mini ITX case. Corsair claims that their other liquid coolers work with that case as well, though. So my question is - who needs this design, and why would it come packaged with a case that will accommodate a more conventional design? That might have been Newegg's decision, but you might want to consider your other options. This cooling system works fine, but installation was challenging and in the 250D it completely blocks the optical drive bay. The standoffs were a little too short for comfort, making it very tricky to bend the tubes enough to get it to fit over the board. This is the only liquid cooler I've had so I don't know for sure, but from looking at it, other Corsair liquid coolers look like they would be easier to install and would leave you the option of installing a DVD/BluRay drive in the Corsair 250D case. It's kind of loud and temperatures spike up to 80C at times, which I still haven't decided whether it's a problem."," Works fine, but unless you're getting it for the package deal discount, I don't know why it would be preferable to other liquid cooler systems. Maybe some cases need this alternative design, but I've seen builds with the Corsair Obsidian 250D that use the typical Corsair liquid cooler design. Why would you choose this instead?",1,1

Does indeed fit the Thermaltake Core v1 case.," Even though my motherboard is listed in the compatibility section it was quite difficult to install this thing, I literally had part of the thermal grease smeared on my fingers as well as some of the other components in the case by the time I was done. If the tubs do indeed rotate I didn't see it they sure wouldn't budge at all for me. The first guy has the right idea without longer standoffs the thing cannot even be properly installed to my motherboard, and since I didn't have the standoffs laying around I had to ghetto rig it in place with bread winders, or wait days to use my pc again until I can get some.No way is this going to be installed to a FM2A88X-ITX+ motherboard without longer standoffs, or something to extend them because what is included won't do. Maybe get some extremely low profile ram which I doubt ram gets quite that low profile, but maybe. As the one picture shows zero ram there, one of the tubs was literally pushing into the ram/bottom of the fan case when I tried installing it, an it could not get close enough to the standoffs to screw down."," As it is still a nice piece of tech, and doing a good job so far I'm relatively satisfied with buying it. It's instructions almost seemed to skip a step, or two, but I wasn't installing this on a fresh build I was installing it to an already built pc, and had quite the time.

Converted our giant , stereo receiver sized HTPC case by getting an mini-ITX board for the A10 and putting it into a Thermaltake Core VI case.Fits the case fine, the A10 is 34c at idleMy only 2 sort of complaints-1. it really should come with a fan power connector splitter (most ITX motherboards only have 2 fan power connectors). With the case fan, the H5 SF's fan and the pump motor power connector I was fortunate to have 3-pin to 4-pin molex adapter on hand to hook to the computer power supply to power the cooling pump.2. Really should have a few different lengths of the standoffs that the fan unit can sit on. This Thermaltake case had a good 3-4 inches of space above where the stock standoffs hold the fan unit. I ended up getting some 1 inch nylon spacers and using 6-32x1-1/4"" screws was able to raise the fan unit up another inch making more room for the cooling tubing so it wasn't as tightly curved as the stock height had it.Overall it does what I need it to do and doing the little mod to raise the fan unit up was no chore for me.",4,4

Installation was relatively easy and the components went together just fine.," The heat sink came with a small dot of heat transfer glue, which covered about 65% of the AMD A-10 7890's surface, even though the heat sink is plenty large enough. The radiator came with 1 fan, which was not able to cool the APU adequately when rendering video. (The ""--B"" at the end of the part number indicates there is only one fan -- buyer be AWARE. The non-B version comes with two fans.) Thermaltake Customer service was abysmally dense and offered no help whatsoever -- they just stalled for time and gave me no useful information. I added a second case fan, blowing in, and a second radiator fan in a push/pull configuration to increase air flow through the radiator, pushing heat out of the case."," I bought this on the recommendation of New Egg technical because the big heat sink on the A-10 7890 simply would not fit in my mini ITX case. (My old A-10 7850 worked flawlessly in the cramped space with the stock cooler, but I just had to have that extra 10% speed increase!) This Thermaltake cooler would probably work just fine for people checking email, browsing the web and light CPU loads, but NOT on a high performance machine which is asked to render video for an hour or two at a time, and probably would not provide sufficient cooling on a machine that plays a lot of APU intensive games. If you're going to buy this cooler, then scrape that small dot of gunk off the heat sink and apply some high quality heat grease for the initial assembly, or you will just have to redo it later; and plan on buying another fan or your CPU might just overheat and crash hard whenever you ask it to perform.

9SIA2F83UR1962,35-106-337,6/10/2016 3:49:59 AM,Andrew S.,You get what you pay for - good cooler for new liquid users,3," - easy to install- pretty easy to use- accommodates a decent range of thermal loads (i.e. 95w/125w)- ""Zero Maintenance"" (closed loop, no changing fluid or bleeding required)", - generic configuration (no hardware/software controllers to tweak)- Can be overwhelmed with stock/mobo controllers regulating temps- can sometimes be annoying to install on small/cramped/stock cases- might require stacked fans and additional controller hardware/software," I bought this cooler about 6mo-1yr ago as a stop gap to keep my processor from blowing up. It turned out to be a pretty good investment. I had an AMD 965 BE that had been abused over the years and was running very hot- hot enough that it regularly blue screened [on the old air cooling] when doing intensive tasks like rendering or gaming (sometimes even full screen video) and this cooler solved most of my problems though I still had to replace the CPU recently.Its not perfect and if you have a processor that runs warm (i.e. over 40° idling in windows) I would recommend going for the next larger radiator size. This cooler is good for a 95watt CPU but a 125watt (or higher) is going to overwhelm this unless you stack fans- even then its not ideal. Still, its good enough for casual computing in the stock configuration. Its more than good enough to use a new processor for gaming so long as you don't overclock. Its currently cooling an AMD FX-8350 in my system and doing a respectable job though I can't rely on the inbuilt system fan controllers to keep the temps in check. For those of you looking for a good introductory cooler system this is probably the best your going to find (and those similar to this) but its not exactly ideal. While it may be a closed loop, i.e. “zero“ maintenance, it can be a bit pesky to install if only for cramped and/or stock cases. Unless you have a spare 120mm outlet for a fan somewhere you'll have to sacrifice your primary case fan for the cause though its not a very major problem, mounting both the radiator and the fan can be a bit of a pain- espechily with space constraints in a case. I don't recommend this setup for anything smaller than an ATX case, even then I would only recommend this for someone with a case that can accommodate liquid cooling hoses or at least some apertures to feed wires/hoses into one's case. It comes with both hardware and instructions for Intel and AMD chips but only enough hardware for one fan. If you have to resort to stacking fans you'll either have to order more screws or hit the hardware store. Thankfully they are stock (m8 screws I believe) but there are some caveats to observe. The radiator wasn't manufactured with space for the screws to fully penetrate their taps so if you over tighten screws that are to long you might puncture the radiator- either get manufacturers recommended hardware or trim down your store bought screws- worst case, use what you can get and invest in some anti-vibration gaskets and it will all be fine.This cooler is also very generic how it powers everything. The pump -requires- that you plug it into your CPU fan header. Since the CPU fan often spins faster than the rest of the system that means it gives more power to the pump than any other fan. Its quiet but if you apply that same logic to the fans blowing threw the radiator you come up against a problem since you are not working on the same principal as a regular CPU fan. I have stacked fans on my setup, one AC blower I turn on while gaming and the stock fan that came with it to blow out heat build up- the stock fan for this system also doesn't move as much air as it claims, either use your existing fan or replace them entirely with high flow/static-pressure for better results. The included fan in this setup will more than likely get connected to the case fan header and most software will deal with increased system temps based off the mother board SO, if you rely off that configuration you will have an entire system- motherboard et. all, running very hot. For this to be an ideal liquid cooling system one should probably invest in a hardware fan controller just to make sure there is adequate air flow for your case and the cooler its self. As with most fans, even running at speed, the whole thing is whisper quiet but be aware that quiet douse not always mean cool. If you have anything beefier than a 95watt CPU you need to add to this system or go to the next highest product tier- i.e. the 270x120mm radiator model.Overall, a good cooler and I have few complaints about it. You get what you pay for though other coolers at twice the price tend to have better support/compatibility with the few quarks I've mentioned (i.e. better mounting options or software/hardware to help in fan control)",None,None

See ""Other thoughts"" for explanation."," The stock fan is pretty noisy-- especially at full speed. I replaced it with an Enermax UCTB12 and it's way more quiet (though admittedly not quite as powerful).Wish the tubes from the radiator to the pump/block were longer. They're long enough to reach from my GPU to rear exhaust, but not long enough for me to route the tubes how I would have preferred (for the sake of organization).There isn't any rubber seal included (to place between the radiator and fan). Maybe it's not completely necessary, but I have extras so I used one of my own. I imagine it helps to reduce leakage from the fan to the radiator, but also it acts as a bit of a noise dampener. After I first got everything installed in place, and initially put power to the system, I heard some worrying sounds coming from the pump and tubes. It wasn't a gurgling sound but kind of a loud whooshing sound. I adjusted the tubes very slightly and the sound disappeared after a minute or so. I hope it was just the system initializing and that it doesn't return."," I'm using this AIO cooler with a Kraken G10 bracket on my R9 290x. With the stock (Sapphire Tri-X) fans, the card would reach 80°C after a couple hours of playing racing games. That's not necessarily a problem, however, the heat expelled from the case during these periods would make the room noticeably hotter than the rest of the house. Well, it's the summer and this is Florida, so I had to do something about that. I bought this AIO because of the compatibility with the G10 and my case, and once I finished the installation, I have been very happy with the results. The card runs about 15-20° cooler while gaming, but more importantly to me, the majority of the heat is dissipated in the radiator, instead of pushed out into the room.

I thought you would attach two fans to a case, then the radiator to the fans, then fans to the radiator. It sounds simple. Instead you have to screw through the fan and into the radiator at the same time. Holding 2 fans at the top of the case and a radiator below them while you try to align screws in not easy. So after all the time I put into installing it I was really hoping for some major cooling. Instead my CPU jumped to the max reading of 100 C as soon as I started. Every time, no matter what header i used, or if it was directly into the power supply. The fans were powered but the pump was broken.

I have only built two systems with liquid cooling for a CPU, this cooler was used on my first build and I love the product and what it does, keep my CPU alive!  I say the negative, but only because I have very limited knowledge in these builds.  This thing came with a ton of brackets that took me a while to get it mounted to the motherboard/CPU due to the amount of metal bars and screws. I am assuming all the screws brackets and so forth are for setting the system on a thousand different motherboards.  My second build was the Corsair H100i V2 liquid cooler, mounted to an I7 4790 CPU.  Corsair's system was so much easier to mount to the motherboard/processor, I felt I had to mention it to the other builders.  Corsair's system took only a few minutes to install.  I was very torn on putting this comment in the CON section, but I can't because I love the product.  I would buy it again, and in doing so, I know I will have to take an extra thirty minutes in mounting the brackets to whatever motherboard processor I am keeping cool.  I love the looks and performance over the Corsair system, however if your system is hidden and you are only going for ease of build and cooling, Corsair wins. In saying that, the DEEPCOOL Captain looks are awesome, the light pulses, it keeps my CPU around the 20-30 degrees C all the time.

It feels like it's going to break when I press it.-My unit had some discoloring inside the tubes and water block. After taking it apart, I found it to be a brown/green algae-like substance.

This was a hard score to give, especially given the fact that I really like Swiftech and I know they have a strong following from enthusiasts.  But, the product has to live up to what is being touted.  I bought the H220 X2 Prestige after reading Techpowerup's review of the cooler and realizing that it was newly released (I love having the latest and greatest).  I bought the X2 with the aspirations of replacing my NZXT X61 that was housed in a Corsair 350D.  The X61 was preventing me from using a rear mounted 120mm fan and also preventing me from having two optical drives (was only able to put one drive in the lower of the two slots).  The X2 arrived in the mail quick and well packaged.  I unboxed this beautiful cooler and immediately got to work at uninstalling the NZXT X61 from my Corsair 350D.  I opened up the X2's instructions and was surprised at how difficult they were to understand and follow compared to the graphic tutorial NZXT provided with the X61.  I went to put the radiator up against the top of the 350D and quickly realized that not only was this cooler not going to fit with the rear fan installed but it wasn't going to fit unless I removed the entire optical drive cage (not an option).  I was totally bummed.... fast forward... I decided to use my Fractal Design R5 (which was going to be used for a new X99 build).So now that I decided to use the Fractal R5 instead of the 350D (moved all components first) I settled on a top mount orientation as well.  I placed the radiator where the screws line up and began installing the radiator screws with a standard craftsman screwdriver.  Without much effort at all, the first screw stripped really badly.  I promise this wasn't an accident (user error)... these screws are incredibly soft compared to other component hardware.  I know I'm setting myself up to being criticized at proper use of tools which I accept knowing full well I used the screwdriver appropriately.  Needless to say I used the utmost care for the remainder of the screws and only managed to strip one more.  Next up was the water block which compared to the NZXT X61 (only AIO cooler I had to compare it to) was incredibly more difficult to install.  The waterblock needs to sit on the CPU and you need to finagle your screwdriver around the CPU with hoses in the way and push down on each mounting screw to secure the water block.  I was having a tough time so I decided to remove the radiator from the top and work around it because the hoses were getting in the way.  Again, this just wasn't as seamless as I was expecting especially considering how easy and effortless the NZXT X61 install went. I installed the waterblock, radiator, funky device header, and then double checked everything in the rig before closing it up.  I finally connected everything in the I/O header and went to boot... WHOA!!! The fans came alive to full speed which wouldn't have been so crazy startling had they not been brushing/rubbing/grinding up against the top of the case mesh.  I immediately turned the PSU off and inspected the radiator and fans.  I made sure all the screws were mounted into the appropriate mounting holes.  I couldn't find any thing wrong on the case end.  What I did see though was that the fans (by design) protruded ever so slightly from the fan guard (what use is a fan guard if it doesn't guard the fan).  As a remedy, I loosened all the radiator screws 4-5 turns until there was a noticeable gap between the radiator and the top of the case.  I booted back up and things were quiet.  As an experiment I slowly began to tighten the screws until the grinding started.  I could only add back another turn or two before the grinding of the fans began.Mistakenly, I mounted the funky header device on the far side of the radiator so I was unable to click through the buttons and try the different LED colors and such.  I assumed there was going to be a software driver (much like the X61 driver/software) that would allow me to manually control the lights and fan speed.  HWmonitor spotted the CPU fan as being at 1100RPM.  I assume this was the pump.  I wasn't able to determine the fan speed at idle with HWmonitor.  I used Asus' AI suite 3 but am unsure if the rotational speeds I was seeing were the pump or the fan.  In hind-site I think I was seeing both... I guess I'm just used to the CAM software for the X61.  The CPU cooler performed wonderfully in regards to cooling the CPU!  Temps were down a solid 5 degrees Celsius during an OCCT stress test (4790k at 4.6GHz).  I was very impressed by its cooling abilities.Because of the all the above mentioned issues I ran into (not working in a micro ATX case, fan's grinding on top of case, crazy hanky install and the stripped screws) I decided to return this cooler and use the X61 until I see the need to upgrade again much later.  I had high hopes to finally try out Swiftech.",2,3

Not so great splitter,5, - A perfect replacement for the older H220-X- Expandability means it can be made into a full liquid cooling system,  - Unfortunately only fits one orientation in my case- Mounting the cpu block was a test of my patience- The PWM splitter that came with mine had a short and was useless," - As said above, the splitter was completely useless.  Fortunately the splitter from the older H220-X works, but I am unable to use the cooler's built-in led lighting or a PWM fan controller (should I choose to buy one).  It would be nice if I could just replace the splitter and keep the rest of the unit.UPDATE:  After I contacted Swiftech via their website, they were extremely helpful and courteous in issuing a replacement for the defective part.

Poor quality control,1, the appearance of the water blockrubberized fans, cheap plastic for the water block mount pointssupplied thermal grease is poor quality," I installed this using the supplied instructions, did not over torque it to the backplate, and was trying to be as gentle with it as possible.upon my first boot, i was getting thermal throttling and shutdown, so i went to remove the waterblock from the cpu in order to put on some artic silver 5 and make sure everything was seated correctly.Going in reverse order of how you are told to install it, the water block jumped under tension and broke the two mounting points on one side for it to be attached to the motherboard.  Due to the sudden tension release, one of the plastic bolt guards on the backplate snapped in half, so I was only able to remove three of the sprung screws from the motherboard, and had to use a pair of pliers to lock the last bolt in order to undo it with a screwdriver.  I then replaced it with an aging seidon 240 just so I can boot the system and do my driver installs.

The radiator is mounted to the top of my case, but it's only mounted with 3 out of the 8 available screws. It's more of an issue the case, but supposedly, it should have worked. Had I known the dual fan radiator wasn't going to fit properly, I would have settled for the DeepCool Captain 120 liquid CPU cooler.

I LOVE IT!,5," I upgraded the stock heat sink and fan which came with my Intel i7-4790K to this baby and boy oh boy is there a difference. Unlike (probably) most people, I don't have a graphics card in my build. I'm just using the integrated graphics on the processor when I (rarely) play an MMO. I won't get into the long story, but I have my reasons. Point is that I have heat from both graphics and the CPU coming off the same chip so this guy made a big difference for me. Before when I was playing GW2 at ""Reccomended"" gfx settings, the chip would get up to 70C+. I saw it go up to 80C once when I was running some bench marking stuff, if I remember correctly. Now? I rarely see it get above 50C. 60C means I'm pushing a good full load through the CPU.

Then again, what do I know... My first liquid cooler...- Mounting in my new Corsair Vengeance Series C70 case was a little tight. The RAM on my MSI Z97 wouldn't fit if I mounted the CPU block with the pipes coming out the right side. Instead, I had to rotate it so the pipes came out the top. This also proved to be difficult because the radiator mounting area was almost out of reach. I had to put some tension on the pipes and really tighten the CPU block screws for it all to work."," This will NOT FIT in Enermax ECA3212-BL ATX Mid Tower Case.

Everything I needed and made absolutely no noise. Now whenever I use it, It makes a super annoying buzzing noise. (The kind of sound that the computers at school made when it turns on. that buzzing sound) I hoped it would go away and it only made that  noise when it started up but it just keeps on going and going. The sound is coming from The fan for the processor. I can't open it because there aren't any screws so i can't look inside. I am positive that is whats causing the noise. It sounds like it is hitting something. Im just a little frustrated by it because I have 3 other people in my family who has bought computer cases and mine was 2x more expensive and Im sitting here wishing I had their case.

I bought this case to build a budget machine for a family member. I build custom loops in my own rigs so I wasn't expecting much. This cooler kept a non delidded i5 6600k in the high 60s to low 70s during synthetic benchmarks while using almost 1.325V!-All the screws come in individual baggies that are LABELED! That is a nice touch!-White LED fans in the top are not overpowering-Included PCIE riser cable and mount for vertical GPU mounting!," -When using the vertical GPU mount, there is not a lot of room between the side panel window and the fans on the card. This chokes the card of airflow really badly. I saw almost a 15c drop on my GPU by mounting it normally on the motherboard. Deepcool either needs to mount the card further back, or find another way to increase air flow in that area. Maybe GPUs with blower style coolers will work better instead of aftermarket ones? I think this GPU mounting thing would really look awesome with a watercooled card and a clear plexi block!- NO intake fans included. This is a big negative for me. Not a single intake fan is included!",,3,6
N82E16811853041,11-853-041,12/18/2016 10:37:09 AM,Andrew W.,Awesome Case but 1 flaw,4," Let me start off by saying this is a very nice case. The looks are nothing short of awesome.  Very easy to hide cables and lots of room for customization. The built in AIO cooler has worked flawlessly. I Was a bit concerned with the amount of reviews stating it leaked but no matter what level of Liquid cooling you have that is a possibility.  Being able to have your video card upright is a very nice touch but it does have its flaws, I will go into that in the cons. The build quality of the case is very nice but for the money the Gage of the Steel is a bit thin. Be super careful not to touch the side panel with even the finest micro fiber cloth because you will scratch it just thinking about wiping off  some smudges. I got this case at a awesome price over the Black Friday sales, and have loved almost every minute of it."," So the Con. Well as expected the PCI extension cable has giving me nothing but trouble. I kept getting crash after crash and It was driving me crazy. The problem was  if you bend the cable in the slightest you will just crash the system. The crazy thing with the computer booted off and you push down on the cable bending it just a little bit, I get flashing lights on the board and the fans spin for a tenth of a second. So one of the coolest parts of the case is a vertical GPU but the extension cable is worthless. Now if you look at all the reviews on them everybody is having issues no matter what brand.", In conclusion I would not hesitate to buy this case again...For the right price. Sub 150 bucks its a steal. The IAO cooler is worth the 150 bucks it self. Oh and my 6800K overclocked to 4.2MHZ running prime 95 for an hour stays below 65 degrees..,3,3

Looks distinct and the pulsing res and pump I really like. Not as much room as my old case but it was a full tower not a mid. Also very quiet unless you crank fans up to max then kinda loud"," The day after writing my review I started up computer and my USB devices except for mouse and keyboard stopped working, at first i thought it was a mother board issue and after accidentally hitting the reset button plugging in my headphone dongle it hung at the GPU bios screen with a VGA error from motherboard. So I checked everything and it seemed right and thought that the vertical mount was too low as getting the thumb screws into the holes for the vertical  holes was a pain and the card was getting loose. So stopped and got some nylon washers on the way home from work that day and that allowed the pc to boot up, but still missing usb. So I put the video card back into the motherboard and everything works again. Tried putting it back vertical and the original issue was back..... So apparently the cable for vertical mount is bad", As I read the specifications I knew this case did not have a CD rom bay so I ordered an external,2,2

Loads of room, great design, I personally love the built-in liquid cooling system. The liquid cooling system mounting is a breeze! The mounting brackets are super simple to figure out with or without instructions. They do have both Intel and AMD with everything labeled so its idiot proof.  The side mount for your GPU is an amazing IDEA and looks sexy as F@#$!"," Now that we got the amazing part out of the way, here are my disappointments. So, last night, I get the case in drool over the box and head to the gym. I get back, I start tearing apart my system and putting it into the beautiful case. Just to say, my prego wife was not happy I spent almost 3 hours putting this together and trouble-shooting issues. Hour one, putting the guts in the case was nice a smooth. I plug everything in hit the power button and nothing. So, I go into trouble shooting mode and trying to figure-out what went wrong. Round one, found out the power button doesn't work. Yes, after unplugging everything testing everything individually it was the power button itself. So, I switch my power on with the reset button. Honestly not a deal breaker, who really hard resets a computer anymore? Get everything back together, hit the reset button, everything turns on but no signal. Power of my gpu dies, *SIGHS*. I have my GPU side mounted with is a EVGA 980 GTX. Rip that out use the on-board graphics everything is working. Remove the side mounting mod and place the GPU directly to the mobo everything works. I wasted a large part of my night over bad QC. I would be happy if they just sent me a working side mounting GPU convertor. Honestly, this has left a sour taste in my mouth that I will get over but, recommending the has dropped dramatically."," The company really needs to lock down their QC. Having a reset button as your power button is whatever, I can rip it apart and fix it when I am not feeling lazy. As for the side mounting GPU that is where I draw the line. Two items that don't work is irritating and time consuming, overall, this could have been avoided if they tested the case and the side mount. Just a heads up, their troubleshooting guide for the side mount is a joke. If a blank screen remove the mobo battery for 15-20 seconds plug back in and it should work. I hope this helps anyone looking at this case and seems somewhat insightful, I would be more than happy to answer any other questions regarding it.",10,15

Installed this on my ROG Maximus VIII mobo and I have to say it looks amazing! It gives the case a premium look with RGB LED's. The instructions were quite good, build quality was good too and the CAM software is fantastic which works just fine with Windows 10. Full screening CAM software displays a plethora of data! Definitely a one stop shop place to see how your computer is doing. The color options and styles are insane so definitely spend some time with it. I recommend watching some youtube videos on Kraken lighting effects. The tubes are nowhere as stiff as H100i so routing it is easier. It's also nice that the tubes are longer. Before purchasing, I initially thought that the tubes were going to sag and sit on top of my graphics card based on the pictures I saw, but it turned out not to. They can support themselves. The power/usb cables were also long enough to run behind my motherboard (take note Corsair!). I opted out of using Kraken as my radiator fan controller. My motherboard has a pump, cpu_fan, cpu_opt headers, and I wanted to use those since they run at hardware level. So I connected the main CPU FAN connector from Kraken to the PUMP Header, and connected my ML120 Red fans to CPU_Fan and CPU_Opt. Feel free to set it up however you like though. I wanted my mobo doing the job. In terms of cooling, I have a i7 6700k and I did not OC it. My CPU generally stays between 21-26C on idle and 47-54C under 100% load. I think it does a great job with cooling and it has been comparable to H100i v2 (or slighty better actually). The pump is quiet! I don't hear it over the running fans. CAM iPhone app works well too if anyone is curious. Live updates so you can see temps on phone etc while playing games."," -CAM software requires a small learning curve, but totally worth it.-I have to agree that it will affect the leftmost RAM slot. I only have 2 sticks so it wasn't an issue for me. Take a look at pictures/videos with this product and 4 RAM sticks. You will see the the leftmost ram is always pushed.

I had to get low profile ram (Vengeance LP) and this ram JUST fit under the cooler.  So be warned if you are upgrading a cooler.  I don't know if this would be an issue on a standard ATX Board - but it was an issue on my M-ITX!", CAM software is sweet and controls this and my HUE+ lighting system.,2,3
N82E16835146057,35-146-057,1/16/2017 3:00:52 PM,Bonnet,Disappointed,2, - Would look good if quality control...- Good performance.- CAM software worked like a charm with my unit.- Easy to install.- Easy to remove..., - Pump logo is crooked.- Pump logo is not level. (I know I already wrote it above but it annoys me so much !).- Rattling noise from the pump.," The unit I've received has a crooked logo. Of course it is just an aesthetic issue but for a product costing almost 200$ it is very frustrating. What's the point of having LED and control over it with CAM software if it's crooked and looks awful. The pump makes a constant and very irritating rattling noise whatever setting I choose in CAM. Overall it's a frustrating product, should look good and work well but does not. I RMA this unit and I'm waiting fore a new one. I've owned many NZXT products without any issues but this cooler is a bummer. For the sceptical reader, I'm not the only one having those issues, I found some threads on different forums.",4,9
N82E16835146057,35-146-057,1/4/2017 8:35:40 AM,Anonymous,Almost Perfect (4.5 Eggs),5, - Endless options for RGB lighting- Pump is extremely quiet compared to other AIO's I've used (even at max speed)- The fans are aesthetically pleasing. I can't speak for the performance as I replaced them with ML120 Pro's- The tubing is long but that could be a pro or a con.- Braided tubing is very uniform- Keeps my 4.8Ghz OC'd 6700k (delidded) at 1.455V under 75C during 24hr stress test. Idles at around 25C and peaks Low 50s while gaming.- No issues with CAM software. It works perfectly fine for me and I am using Windows 10 Pro. Though I only use it to mess with  lighting and control pump speed. I plugged my fans into my mobo's fan headers instead of the PWM headers coming off the block., - As others have stated the tubing coming off the block will interfere with Ram Slot 1. This was very unfortunate because I bought it to install into an ITX build in my Nano S just to find out it wouldn't fit. I bit the bullet and moved up to a Maximus VIII Gene in a Define Mini C for Ram clearance. It still interferes with Slot 1. But at least I'm able to use both sticks of ram now. Was it worth it? HELL YES IT WAS! This cooler is beautiful and whisper quiet even under load.," - Lots of Pro's and only ONE Con. That one con can be a deal breaker for a lot of people, it wasn't for me though because I only use 2 ram sticks. Those using 4 will have problems and will either have to compromise or forget about this cooler altogether.",13,14

Install instructions for a novice would have been absolutely terrible."," Very disappointed in this. At about $300 I expected better. The screws that attach the water block to the CPU are extremely easy to strip out. There was no reason for this to crack. It had not been disassembled, there was no stress on the tubing or the reservoir. Once it had been installed the case was not opened again until the leak was discovered.

The mount used to connect the reservoir to the pump doesn't seem to be the greatest out there when compared to other brands. For a $300 kit I was expecting more., I had the loop running perfect for about four days. I woke up to it leaking all over the table. I noticed it was leaking where the reservoir met the pump so I took the reservoir off. It was then that I noticed a half inch long crack at the edge of the reservoir. I decided to add a bit of epoxy to the crack and it did work for another few days. Bottom line is that when comparing the way that this reservoir is mounted to the pump to other brands its just not the best way I have seen.,9,9

Could come with a couple more compression fittings.," If you buy the Level 10 GT case and an ASUS Maximus VII Formula RoG mobo (like I did), you will only be able to use 1 of the fans on the radiator (if you mount it on the top of the case), the armor / water block over the chipset gets in the way. If you want to mount the radiator outside of the case I suggest purchasing more tubing. Also, if you get the Maximus mobo and want to use the chipset water block, or a GPU water block perhaps, I recommend buying the Enzotech 45° swivel and the compression fittings.

I had to buy a whole new set of hex keys with better torque, because the allen screws are fastened extremely tight. I managed to remove 1 of 2 that had started to strip using my other hex key. The other was thoroughly stripped, so now I have to buy an ezy-out or some other tool to remove it. The cost in tools is nearly the same as the cost of the pump itself.This is just one of the examples where I find DIY such a PITA, as there's always that ""something"" that turns out to be totally different from the instructions or tutorial.

This works well........ But don't forget to order your own brand if you're a nalI'm only a nal about a few things in life....Wine, women and thermal paste.

Corsair makes one, but you need to run a USB cable off of it to control features......Huh? That's not hard to hide....Right? Anyway, was building an i7 rig in red when this came on sale for a great price. Called my son and asked if he would like a blue center piece......He said yes. Corsair went on sale the next day for same price. Oops. This cooler doesn't heat the 6700kUp at all. Gaming 2k in the low 50's with a 980ti amp Omega? (Running at 4.2 CPU) Who would've thunk? We did replace stock fans with two thermal take riing fans ( look into those, they're awesome.) We were going to use the cm Master air maker for cooling, but it truly looks like a pain and review sites stated liquid still beats it. Easy install, just baby it and have extra hands on hand.(?)

9SIA6ZP44Z4091,35-103-209,12/7/2016 8:30:44 PM,David S.,Good CPU cooler,5," I got this about 5 months ago and have had it in usage for almost that whole time. Previously I had an air cooled CPU with stock cooler and had so many over-heating issues when under significant load. My CPU temp was always 52C or above. Once I got this installed that temp dropped to the 40s at its peak.The fans are huge so they are decently quiet, that's a benefit.If you use the vibration dampening rubber they provide the fans don't really cause vibration to speak of, I like when they think of that ahead of time for me.The provided hardware is good, and packaged very nicely, it was convenient. In fact I'd say the packaging on its' own was a definite plus.The screws are all a little extra long, as they should be, so adding wire-wound fan guards or thicker mounting brackets is not a problem. That made my life easier since I don't have a standard set-up.Installing the pump onto the CPU really wasn't so bad, I was worried the brackets would be a pain but it wasn't at all."," The water lines are fairly rigid and the fittings rotate with difficulty, but that's a one time annoyance when you get it installed. I like it better than other water lines I've seen, it feels more solid reliable and permanent, so while annoying to work with I am still happy with it.The pump has a blue LED in it and while PC lighting became a thing years back, I don't like it so much. But with the case closed it's not visible so that's fine, just a bit pointless."," If your case isn't designed for water cooling it may be a pain to retrofit in a water cooling unit regardless of who makes it, keep that in mind. My PC is in a $40 case + PSU special from 2002. I had to take the side off, mount the radiator with 3D printed brackets, and make a new metal side panel.Since it's not really a stand-alone thing, meant to go in a case that handles a water cooling radiator, there are no provided fan guards. I had to buy my own, a pair of chrome 120mm fan guards, but those cost so little it's no big deal.When turned on there's a rushing water noise that quickly stops and isn't so loud but I admit I still am not used to liquid in my computer so it always gives me pause.I had to go into my PC's BIOS and set the fan header the pump is plugged into to run manually at 9000rpm all the time, it could handle the speed (some BIOS refuse to work with numbers over 5000rpm, don't know why) the fan speed could be controlled based on CPU temperature but to be honest it's not so loud, so I set them to run at full speed all the time anyway. It works well enough for me.To be more theoretical I really like the design concept at work in the pump. I can't say comparatively how much benefit it caused, this is my first liquid cooling unit. but I like the design concept.",2,4
9SIA6ZP44Z4091,35-103-209,11/15/2016 11:31:52 AM,Danny I.,Was okay at first. Now I regret purchase.,2," Initially the pump and fans were very quiet. You could hardly hear them at all and I was not sure if the pump was even on. This was my first liquid cooler and I wanted a quiet system. I was pleased with initial result, especially since it also did a good job of keeping my CPU cool.", The first problem I encountered was the ultra stiff tubing. It was difficult to get into my mid-tower case and I am very nervous that the tubes may crack at some point due to the pressure on them where they bend. I knew going in the tubes would be stiff but I had no idea they would be this difficult.After about 2 months of use one the fans on the radiator became very loud. It would work fine for a little while after starting up up but after about an hour the noise was noticeable and irritating. About a week ago the once silent pump became loud. It sounds like a puttering lawnmower engine. I feel like a standard air cooler would be more quiet at this point. I'm very disappointed considering how quiet it was in the beginning.," The product was okay at first but quickly developed noise problems. Cooling performance is okay but if your goal is a quiet system, I would look elsewhere.  I regret my purchase and wish I had purchased a different All-in-one liquid cooler. So far I've been unable to find contact information on the Cooler Master website to resolve my issues. Maybe I just received a bad unit.I understand some devices fail, that's life. However Cooler Master doesn't seem to make finding RMA info easy. I am willing to look past defects and give a company a chance to make things right. Easy  to use RMA policies make me a customer for life. I don't know if I'll trust Cooler Master for water cooling after this.",2,2

So, the threads, that you screw the bolts into, are a bit tighter, and hold a bit better.  Also, the fans have a semi-hard rubber mounts, that you slip the bolts through, to screw them into the radiator, which makes it a bit easier to deal with."," As of right now, I do not see any cons, it is working just fine, for now, but, if there is any that pop-up, I will update this, so that everyone can feel a bit safer."," Yes, I would recommend this to others, and I have the feeling, that the old pumps, that they used for the Seidon's cooler's, were not right, for some reason, seemed like they all collapsed within a month of each other, was a bit odd.  Although, I have never had any issues with any other Cooler Master products.  And before I forget, the tubing, that they use, for the flexibility is a bit stiff, mainly because the fluid has plenty of pressure, which will put pressure on the flexible tubing, and make it feel a bit stiff, which is common.  It is no different, then taking a balloon and filling it with water, shortly before it reaches its limits, it will be a bit stiff, but still a bit flexible.  Same scenario as the tubing.  This also comes with the ""anti-vibration"" rubber piece, that you put down before the fans(Obviously will only fit the fans, which makes it easy to not mistake it.).  Also comes with somewhat simple instructions(As in, not super easy, nor super hard, but do need to have some moderate skill level in assembly and reading installation instructions.), so, if you have not done something similar before, or at least watched another do it, then I suggest you have someone who has done it before, help you.  They don't need to do it for you, just to be a guide, in a way.  Took me roughly half an hour, to pull the air cooler out, then install this, which, the hardest part, was installing the backplate, that you mount the pump to, due to, if you already have the motherboard installed, it is best, to just remove it, so you can get past the plating, that it is mounted to, with the backplate ""wings""(What you install the pump bolts to, for the INTEL CPU's, when installing for the AMD set-up.), they make it a bit harder to deal with, but, it is not impossible though.",2,2
9SIA6ZP44Z4091,35-103-209,7/30/2016 4:21:20 AM,William B.,Great startup for AIO liquid cooling solution,5," - Quiet operation, Cool CPU temps and fairly easy to assemble.", - long screws did not line up well through the fans and anti vibration gasket making it a nuisance to get them installed without cross threading.- Fill port conflicted with motherboard for basic instruction install.," This cooler was purchased for my I7 - 6700K on my new Gigabyte G1 Gaming 7 board.  Mounting in the Cooler Master 693 full tower case should have been a breeze however i ran into a bit of a snag.  Now i could say that this is a mutual con among all three contributing factors however i will post it accordingly.  This cooler matched up with the 240 mm spacing at the top of my case perfectly however when i went to mount the motherboard i realized i could not reach two screws so i had to take it out.  After placing the motherboard into the case i found a bit of an over site with the setup.  The place where the hoses come out of the cooler with the sealed filler port were in the way of the plate covering the IO ports.  Now i realize that the motherboard that i selected and this cooler are not matching up well at all and so i thought ok ill just flip the cooler and put the hoses near the OOD no big deal right?  Nope.  Now the hoses block my SATA port for the OOD and i cant move it because of removable drive trays and it blocks their SATA ports if i move them up.  At this point i have a brilliant idea to mount the radiator outside the case however i noticed because its an AIO if i pull the hoses to route through the gromits my warranty is voided so that became a no go.  I spent about 3 hours looking at this cooler, case and motherboard combination kicking myself in the rear for going for the 240 instead of the 120.  I had considered drilling new mount holes, cutting clearance room from the plastic on the motherboard and, trimming the top of the case to make this work.  I almost gave up on it all together.  I ended up discovering that the case i have has just enough clearance on the OUTSIDE of the top of the case under the plastic beauty plate to fit a case fan so what i ended up being able to do was mount the radiator on the inside of the case with the fans attaching to it from the top of the outside of the case.  all in all it worked out and it runs great.  If your considering this cooler take a good solid look at your case and desired motherboard before getting this type of product as it could potentially become a challenging install.  situations like the one i had can arise from failure to look at the fine details in your setup and unlike myself you may not be as lucky to find a work through if you plan or purchase items badly.  i could have been sitting on a thousand dollars of parts waiting on a $50 replacement air cooler.  Remember, for us our builds are like our hot rods and sometimes you have to customize your install rather than just bolting in parts.  Keep calm and build on.",4,4

It can be a problem for cases with front air filters.," This is new water cooler.  Not an OEM made AIO water coolers by Asetek for Corsair, Zalman, NZXT, Thermaltake, Arctic and few others.  All the competitors use the same OEM supplier but its rebranded product and the only difference are the fans itself.I had no difficulties installing this MasterLiquid Pro 240.  I have to admit that the tubes are not flexible like Corsair but its doable.  Mounting the pump to the CPU is easy and the instructions are easy to follow.  I noticed the water pump was running at 9,600 rpm and according to the Cooler Master specs and it stated 3,000 -/+ 10%.  I contacted Cooler Master tech support to confirm the readings.  They said the pump is new technology and the computer does not recognize it so that's why its showing 9,600 rpm.  The tech guy said to divide the water pump rpm readings by factor of 3 so accurate reading is 3,200 which is within the spec range.  My computer rig is i7-6700k and idle temp is 28C with its stock fans.  I had Corsair and Zalman and I have to say MasterLiquid Pro 240 is the best one so far.The mounting 1"" screws for the radiator got a toolless knob on it and its not flat.  It can be a problem if using a case with a front filter for air intakes as the knob can block the filter from attaching to the case properly.  I had to go to my local hardware store to get the flat head screw.  The screws will work fine if using the radiator at the top of the case as it is supposed to be used as an exhaust. That's why I deducted one point for this.  Cooler Master should have offered both type of screws.",9,9

I applied some of the compound and its looking better already.When you get yours, PLEASE replace the thermal compound to protect your CPU/APU. The quality just wasn't there. As far as installation, I'd prefer install instructions be fully disclosed in the box, rather than needing a PC to follow the instructions (Because I'm trying to BUILD one)For intel users, You should be set with the pre-installed brackets, AMD users have to kinda work for it. There are 2 intel brackets by the way.. Watch yourself. If you have an Intel processor that doesn't fit the bracket pre-installed to the unit, get ready to work like the AMD users do to get it installed.Took me about 45 minutes to install for a first-time computer builder. And 5 to replace the compound a month later.",1,1

But now with this water cooling setup its SUPER quiet and SUPER cool. My card never goes above 57 degrees now when it use to go to the 90s easily.

Its one of the quietest pumps I've heard, much quieter than any of the coolermasters AIO's.

In order to do this, I had to purchase an AIO cooler to go with it.  Everyone has such good things to say about the X40/1 and X60/1 AIOs, so I was expecting the X31 to be no different.  The reviews that I saw online for the X31 were all positive, so I decided that I would take the plunge on the X31.Setup onto the G10 is no easy task, and I did require the help of a second person.  Anyone who did this by them self needs to be checked for a 3rd arm.  Thankfully I did buy this with the G10, because the instructions or lack thereof for the X31 are a complete joke.  It is a single page(half page), with almost no words on it, just pictures, with very poor angles.  If I was applying this to a CPU, I would surely have to watch a video to help me through it. Thankfully the G10's instructions are very good, and they use an X40 as the example cooler, which was essential to my success of setting it up.  One of the selling points of the X31 was that it can connect to an internal USB header, which allows you to control the fan speed and pump speed through NZXT's CAM software.  While CAM does look aesthetically pleasing, it is not very helpful and is a resource hog.  My CPU usage would go as high as 20% for a simple monitoring program.  And, to my behest, you cannot control the pump speed!  That was the main selling point, variable pump speed control!  Not true.  You have to hook it up to a fan header on your motherboard if you want that, and the controllable range is only 3000-4000rpm.  No matter what speed, it still makes a rattling noise. Controlling the fan speed is also not as you would expect.  There is a massive lag time between changing the fan speed on CAM and it actually happening.  It would often display the wrong fan speed.  I eventually said screw it, uninstalled CAM and use my fan headers and Fan Xpert II as my source of control.The X31 performs well, my temperatures are great.  They went from 70C on the stock ACX cooler to barely hitting 50C on the core. I am thrilled about that.  The G10 is a legitimate option if you add heatsinks to the VRM and VRAM.  My X31 has two fans in push/pull at ~60% fan speed so the fans are very quiet, and the included fan is of high quality.The fans are not the issue though, it is the pump.  The pump has a terrible, rattling noise to it.  It is very distinctive and extremely annoying.  As I type this, the rattling continues.  I did know full and well that I would not be getting LED control with the X31, but I figure I mention it as a con anyways because that is one of the unique options that NZXT brings to their AIOs, but it not here in the X31.Overall, the temperatures are as good as advertised, this thing does perform exceedingly well.  The pump noise and the lack of control are what make me grade this so poorly.  I am really disappointed with the CAM software and lack of control.",5,6

I even got a different 120mm fan to mount to the radiator reading previous comments on the fan being noisy. (pst. it wasn't the fan, it was the water pump) - Secondly what exacerbated the first problem is the fact that the pump by default, wants to pump at 100% all the time... -_-So I have an ROG Maximus Hero with on board waterpump header and controller software which can control the water pump speed. GREAT! so what's the problem? Every time it shuts down or reboots, I have to launch the software and manually change the waterpump speed. for some reason I cannot for the life of me get it to maintain the speed profile I have created."," If you don't mind a bit of noise, and the small glitch with the pump control this cooler works like a champ for cooling in a compact form!",1,1

I chose this particular kit when I realized that the Cooler Master HAF case actually has a mounting rails for a 360mm radiator inside the case. This allow the radiator to be sandwiched between the three 120mm fans it comes with and the two 200mm case fans for a beautiful push/pull effect. I also added a sentry fan controller to make it easier to crank up the fan speeds when needed. I am getting amazing temperatures, at normal web browsing/idle/even writing this review I actually get  20-22 degrees C, which is literally the room temperature, even with the fans all on low. Using a CPU burner, the highest temp I was able to achieve was 50 degrees C, with fans turned to max. For gaming it sits around 40 degrees C.  I bought this with the intentions of overclocking, so I will post an update when I actually crank up the speeds. I love the reactor look, and it looks really cool in the case as it glows red on and off."," It's a closed system, so you wouldn't be able to add anything else to the loop without some extreme modification. The hoses don't look like they are threaded into the radiator so I'm not sure if it's even possible.

I've been waiting and saving to build this computer for months, and I'm devastated. Hopefully I can get a refund on the cooler, but I'm probably out hundreds of dollars from the other parts.Don't buy this product unless you have totally waterproof components...EDIT: After contacting DEEPCOOL customer support, they were incredibly understanding of my situation, and within 12 hours had a full reeimbursement of my parts sent to me. I changed the rating from 1 stars to 3 stars, because the product was a 1 star but the customer service was a 5 star, so in my mind that averages out to 3.",6,8

The aesthetics are great. The build quality is top notch., I do wish they offered it in more colors to make it more universal. It doesn't appeal to everyone's taste.," I would definitely recommend this product. I actually own the previous model also. Somehow after almost a year of using it, it started leaking from the pump. The leak dripped down onto a brand new GTX970 and fried it. I contacted DEEPCOOL support and informed them of what happened. After about 3 days of correspondence, sending photos of the leak and damage to my GPU, they reimbursed me for the current Newegg.com prices for both the cooler, and my GPU, which totaled $444.00. That has to be the best outcome I have ever had from any situation. I was actually astonished that they agreed to pay me in full for all of the damages. That really says something about how much this company cares about it's customers, and their willingness to provide quick and amazing customer support.

N82E16835856079,35-856-079,7/21/2016 12:14:14 AM,J C.,Thoroughly surprised,5," When I ordered this case, I took a leap of faith, not knowing what to expect from a product that had no previous reviews. As the groundbreaking reviewer I can say: Put your fears to bed. I may not be a super savvy, temperatures to the decimal level builder, but I do know good from bad parts. This is being used to cool an i7 6700K at a stock clock, and it does so fantastically. My game room is typically 87F, or 30C. When idling, this beast keeps my CPU at an impressive 23-25C. Who needs AC? When gaming, it peaks at 55C and I've never seen it go above that. I play Arma 3, Squad, and many other CPU-intensive games. This may be a pro or a con, but there is no completely aggravating and utterly useless software I have to deal with to get my PC running comfortably, unlike the Corsair this replaced. That said, you have virtually no control over the fan speeds, so these fans run full most of the time, keeping my PC optimally cool.Further, the installation on this was great! The Corsair I installed previously on my Z170 Sabertooth mobo made me feel like I was doing it wrong despite following the instructions explicitly. This was a simple one-two-three install that left me genuinely happy after the quick process. I didn't have to fiddle and diddle around with a gorillion screws and mounting brackets, heck I barely needed instructions for this one! They are in Chinese though, but pictures did help. Looks amazing in my Phanteks Eclipse case."," Now, with great fan power, comes great decibels. This is a loud one, stock. A little noisier than the 280MM Corsair H110i I bought to replace after the former broke. They perform roughly the same, right now, but I think the Corsair came equipped with better fans. Not to say these fans aren't great! The red pieces are rubberized and reduce friction and noise on their own, but there's just something to be said about fans - they're inherently loud. I'm considering picking up Corsair's new ML series fans for this, and may update my review upon installation."," The only thing I wish for this would be more color choices for the 'breathing' tube. I know, I know, you see that on just about anything with a light. It's just a thought.",6,6

9SIA4RE4RT4950,35-118-147,9/11/2015 4:01:30 AM,Michael S.,Quiet cooling has never been so loud,3," Works great! Keeps my 140w Haswell-E well within safe limits even at minimum pump and fan RPMS.  While there are better coolers out there, it is absolutely overkill for any sane user, and even overkill for most sane overclockers."," The pump cavitates constantly at all RPMS.  With no reservoir to catch air bubbles in the cooling loop, the thing is constantly sucking up air bubbles and pushing them through the waterblock, leading to a noise not dissimilar to a drunken man relieving himself in a back alley.  When I first tested the unit before installation, it cavitated so loudly I swore it was broken.  It was not broken, but the cavitation noise was louder than the pump noise itself. I mounted the radiator in the top of my case, all according to Zalman's preferred methods After about a week of the pump running at 50% (1000 RPM)  I was pleased to discover the cavitation actually stopped, and the unit was blissfully quiet.  After about a month, the cavitation returned, quieter than before, but still louder than the pump itself.While the unit continues to perform just fine, the fact that it's constantly sucking air gives me concerns about how many years it's going to last before performance IS impacted.On the subject of noise, The cooling fans included are high speed and performance, but of dubious build quality. One of the two fans on my unit already has a failing bearing. Replacing the fans is tricky, they mount to flimsy plastic, and their mounting screws go through the fan and into the heatsink, rather than through the heatsink and into the fan. The unused mounting holes on the other side of your replacement fan will get in the way of you putting the screws back in. You'll have to dremel them off, or use a screw driver that can fit through the mounting holes of the fan. I have always been a fan of zalman products for how incredibly quiet they are. The Reserator 3 falls flat on it's face though in this respect. While the pump and the fans are both quiet enough at low  RPMS, Zalmans inability to more completely purge the loop of air makes the entire unit unpleasantly loud. Liquid cooling loops with a reservoir to catch any air bubbles trapped in the loop simply don't make the kinds of noises the reserator 3 makes."," You really cannot go wrong with how well this unit keeps your CPU cool.  It is a very capable cooler and is pleasing to the eye as well. Unfortunately the Reserator 3 really fails to live up to Zalmans reputation for quiet cooling solutions.  The cavitation noise is really disappointing, and could possibly be fixed by bleeding the loop more carefully at the factory, or the addition of a small internal reservoir in the radiator to catch stray air bubbles and keep them from being sucked into the pump.  In a quiet room, when all your PC's fans are turned to minimum, you will be treated to a constant irregular trickling that is far more annoying than ordinary fan noise, and significantly louder than any fan in your case.",6,7

My 1st unit was damaged in shipping and New Egg promptly took care of me. So Reason #1 to shop here. Once the 2nd unit arrived in perfect shape I began the install. Install is pretty straight forward you will just need to make sure you have space. Anyone who can build a PC should not have trouble with this.NOTE: The radiators and fans are THICK u will need space. Did I mention u need space????In my AMD Scorpicus Mid tower I had to massage my case with a dremel by opening some new ""Air Vents"" in the top so I could shift the unit such that it does not touch the Ram. Also had to ""trim"" the fins on my Ram. (Gotta Love a Dremel) With the unit mounted and in place and everything reconnected and doublechecked, I fired the beast up. I am working with the following. Asrock Fatal1ty MB, AMD FX 8350 CPU32gb Gskill Ripjaw Ramdual 240gb SSD Hard Drives500gb Seagate barricudaSoundblaster ZX Sound CardAMD Radeon R9 295 X2 8gb Video CardSo system boots fine and using the utility that comes with the Fatal1ty MB, I see my temps have dropped way down. So now to Test...Prior to this cooler using a Cooler Master Seidon 120 I would get 60 degrees Celsius using Star Citizen. Stock clock with the Zalman.... 42/44 degrees Celcius.So now I overclock. After numerous settings, voltage chages, and reboots(Won't bore ya with the details)I now have my FX 8350 running stabily at 4.4ghz and on normal games my temps are 43/45 degrees celcius and Star citizen maxed out runs 54/55 degrees celcius. So the effects are clear. This cooler can get the job done. I wish it would have been offered at a 99.99 price point vs the 134.99 price I paid, but you do get what you pay for as they say. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!",5,5
9SIA4RE4RT4950,35-118-147,3/20/2015 6:21:55 AM,Sammie W.,Almost Perfect,4," Keeps an aging 8350 quite cool @ 4.4 gHz 18c Idle up to 48-49c on full load in AOD stability test, for days if it pleases.Assembly parts included are of excellent quality.Backplate mounting was quite frankly, genius. Got this in by myself. (use that box it came in to sit it on and keep it cpu level while you work at the side panel of the case)"," Included 120mm PWM fans are complete and total garbage, it's the reason for the docked egg unfortunately. It's so disappointing, in such a high cost AIO cooling solution, especially from Zalman. The cooling of the fans isn't poor, but they also aren't anywhere near what they should be; especially for the noise generated from the materials they are made from. They are made from some kind of very rigid hard plastic, I couldn't find any fan setting, from profile to full bore; that didn't make that slight plastic mechanical tick. The fans were easily replaced and the rest is history. Also! While the fans ""can"" be replaced, be careful. The plastic I mentioned is also what shrouds the radiator itself. If you go to replace them just take it slow and brace the plastic around the rad with your free hand. It does NOT like torque when replacing the fans. Be warned."," Have an i7 4790k on its way. I'm hoping with the lower TDP, it'll serve me even better when that arrives.Also, it has to be noted, my case is a Thermaltake Core V71. There is a rail offset from the motherboard running on top of the inside of the case. Make sure you have the room and especially the width. As it is, with my LP memory it still barely has an inch between the fans and the top of the memory heatsink and this case is huge, so be aware. VERY IMPORTANT: Read the Instructions carefully and make sure you are using the correct screws for the right step/socket. Very easy to mix some of these up to the untrained eye.",1,1
9SIA4RE4RT4950,35-118-147,3/9/2015 11:31:40 AM,James C.,My First Pre-Assembled Liquid Cooling System... and I'm old.,4," Nice and gigantic... Well engineered and designed as most Zalman products are. My ancient liquid cooling system started leaking, so I had to switch to the CHEAPO stock fan. Jeez, AMD fans are terrible. My FX-8350 was getting absolutely annoying with fan noise under half load and even after re-seating the fan with a better thermodynamic compound, it still sounded like a Dyson Airblade when just watching TV. After some good success installing one of their smaller offerings in a friend's rig, I decided to give this a go to shut this thing up for good. The proc would hit 65C at half to 3/4 load before as if the fan wasn't even built for the proc and I was running stock speeds. With this, I've never seen it crack 40C even while gaming. That's good in my book and the installation (for proper cases) is a breeze."," From a design standpoint, I would have liked to see the ability to easily reverse the mounting. I knew ahead of time my case wasn't tall enough with clearance between the top of the motherboard and the case, but I have an Antec LANBoy (dumb name) whatever case that is just a skeleton and mesh that I just sawed into the top and the fans have enough flow, but they are pushing down. Obviously not the optimal top exhaust everyone should have, but two 120mm rear and side fans pull well and oddly enough, my GTX980 runs cooler now that it doesn't have to share airspace with a hairdryer above it.The instructions aren't ""hard"" for enthusiasts to follow, but they are a bit ""Ikea"" and tiny. I also had one bad LED on a fan upon arrival, but of course this is after you install this thing and Newegg offered to RMA, but I wanted to hit Zalman to just replace the fan. At the time Zalman's entire website was down which was weird, but hopefully they will just ""be cool"" and send me a fan.", I was happy with the results of this and purchased a second one for my i7-980X that I am transitioning to a home automation and media server.,3,3

Blue LEDs on the cooler are cool.," The cooling fans are meant to be installed at the inside top of the case, and the case should have an open grill on top of the case so the fans can blow air out through the top of the case.  But this was not obvious to me before purchasing the product.The cooling fans did not fit in my case.  The cooling fan unit is large, with both fans connected together.  This large size is required to be able to cool as well as it does.  My memory has tall heat spreader fins, which were too tall to be able to fir both the memory with fins and this CPU cooler's large fans inside the case.  I removed the grill on top of my case, moved the cooler's fans to the OUTSIDE top of the case, created a bracket for both mounting the fans securely and blocking the air flow out the top of the case except for the air flow through the fans.  The bracket was a large flat piece to cover the top of the case (with the top grill removed) with a figure-8 cut-out in the center.  The fans are so securely mounted, that I can pick up my whole case by lifting the fans.  I did not need to get a new super-size case, I have cool looking fans on top of my case, the cool LEDs in the fans are clearly visible, and most importantly my CPU and my whole case stay cool.", Great cooling system for hot CPUs.

I looked high and low for a water unit, and this unit continuously caught my eye. It had a cool blue transparent look i couldn't get over. So I on and off debated on purchasing it over a course of a few weeks. So I researched it. There weren't many reviews besides Newegg's, which one was clearly opposed to this device while the other didn't give much feedback besides a plus score. Well I installed it and I am currently using it (overclocked) now. Not a single issue with its performance. When idle and not overclocked it sits around 35 and doesn't change much despite the workload. The same for OC'd, it sits around 45-50. The unit works great. Kudos to ZALMAN. It does its job...( VERY WELL!)", A little loud at full speed... but generally wouldn't be there at that speed anyway (just as long as it keeps it cool!).

(location location location!)Case arrived packaged nicely aside from the dent and gash in the cardboard the case itself was fine... or was it?They sent me the correct color--White with blue ""lighting accents"" and tubingWater Cooler Already ready to plug and playFans already mounted on radiator Nice amount of room internally to build in and everything fit nice and neatlyThe backside has a plethora of cable management mounting points! (even enough to quiet my OCD)SSD Mounts on backside are very nice as you mount on a caddy and then use a slide lock then use a thumbscrew to secure (has 2)Comes with a GPU Vertical mount bracket and the PCIE x4 extender!Has a way to customize the large empty front space for cable management optimization or inserting another radiator and fan setup as well as the ability to mount an SSD or 2 on the visible side for the windowRemovable HDD tray for extra cooling support on top of the extra front spaceIncluded fan hub which can also accommodate the pump as well for other MOBO's that may have limited headers  Rubber noise dampening bumpers for the PSU mounting are that felt like they were well made and not cheaped out on (other previous cases had cheap thin ones that really did nothing)Power switch on the side for the LED's built in for highlighting and effects"," The Bad:Box looked like it had been purchased and opened and then RMA'd before I was sent it from NewEgg.comThe GamerStorm Logo was damaged due to being put on incorrectly and when being packaged it likely caught on something but the ""S"" part of it was half peeled off and hanging out all messed up (foil tape type of sticker, so no fixing that) The Front I/O panel could use some type of cover to snap on and feels like its an incomplete item there, no labels for the mic/headphone jacks or even color differences (I thought it was missing a snap in cover it was so bad and contacted the company) Built everything in case and mounted the water block hooked up the fan splitter and its 3 fans as needed, even mounting my PSU in what felt like upside down to me as this cases instructions said to, plugged in the PSU and flipped the switch on it, the motherboard started its color breathing ""system off mode"" lighting so I pressed the power button on the front panel--NOTHING! Hit the reset button--AGAIN NOTHING!!Reached in and hit the Start button on the motherboard, fired right up and before i could sit down windows was on and loaded as well as all my run on start up programs and GPU monitor, and the LED's in the fans were a static on bright clean white which adds a cool ambiance but with no dimmer switch or way to turn them off was kind of drowning out my ""Clown on acid"" amount of built on RGB. and then it began... the pump wouldn't kick on (or at least thats what I thought as it has a built in LED as well to help with the effects and accents and helps highlight how the case is a ""living machine"" breathing effect coupled with the LEDs behind the reservoir on the front that aren't on either) so I restarted went into BIOS made sure the CPU temp was staying low and at 4.2GHz idle temps were hovering at about 31* C--pretty nice to me, so I double checked that the fan hub and the pump (hooked into its own pump header) were on and receiving power--Double Checked they were indeed on and perfectly running... still no LED's on front or on the CPU block... Powered off disassembled it ALL down to a bare frame holding a motherboard with the cooling block mounted on the CPU and had found that none of the front panel button cables were hooked to the buttons nor was the LED power cord hooked into it (nice factory QA checks!--or was it a return? ) and I had to basically guess which clip went in which slot as the left side (power reset and LED header/splitter and switch) had the same amount of cables running to the plugs and same shape and all cables in this case are black so no color indicator for anything. Upon tracking the CPU blocks LED cable to the front figured out which plug had what on it but no indication of which port to plug it into on the faceplate, so I guessed, got lucky on first try and moved on to reassembling the case... yay! Now that its all here I tried messing with the LED's which have a breathing effect of like 2 seconds on and then 3 seconds off (just guesstimated not actually timed) I tried (and hoped the LED off switch would turn the ones on the fans off along with the breathing ones on the CPU and the Front backlighting on the case--or at least have maybe 3 or 5 presets ... kept pushing the button and holding it or multiple pushes to see if it would somehow do something besides the ""breathing"" or ""OFF"" modes, even better I noticed that all this button does is provide false hopes as it ONLY turns off the breathing backlight for the reservoir on the front panel--NOTHING ELSE!!!! Lights on the fans should have had the LED's wired to the LED switch as they are three times brighter than the ones mounted for effect on the front panel and with how the AIO loop is not just built into this cases design, but ingrained in its very fabric of being I figured it would have had that small option on there as well so you could turn the lights off (CPU block too) for if you want to have it as a setup for a home theater case or game in a darker setting--or forbid ""Netflix and chill"" in a darker setting. And the only reason I thought it had these possibilities was due to the description of its lighting effects from the manufacturers site. Why Wasnt the CPU block white colored like on the stand alone El Capitain white kits to match the white case and justify the higher color cost (when I purchased)"," THE OVERALL:If you use minimalist lighting such as white LED's or no LED/RGB this cases lighting looks clean and great from the fans alone, the pulsing front accent can be turned off thankfully, it will be easy for me to modify VERY SOON to add what features I think it needs on that side of things.The cooler included is very much a great AIO loop for your CPU so long as you don't go crazy on the overclocking side of things (I also am running my system at a light overclock and maintaining very good temps across the board). the fact that the Genome II case is about $229.00(maybe $249.00 if not on sale) US made it an easy choice for me for the cases internal space and accommodations and the potential I saw for future water loop customization, however, I couldn't justify the extra$50.00 to $100.00 US for the ROG red/black RGB edition and I am glad I didnt buy it due to its lack of Aura Sync with software and being a 256 color controller you plug everything into and coming in the black and red scheme only was also a killer as black doesnt reflect colored lighting as well to make the RGB on board and GPU carry over for more saturation on the internals. and with the fan lights still being the same white LED's for accent lighting I feel it would drown out the RGB youre trying to use to fight against the black and blood red ROG edition monster with. If you want a case and loop to start a mod, I highly recommend (as I may try and fit a micro ATX in here with my current setup in the near future for streaming and editing purposes, and ... just because). I will also be cutting a window in to show off my SSD mounts and cable management that this case allowed my OCD to go full swing at if I cant figure out how to mount the micro system inside. But NO MATTER WHAT-- I will be adding a complete LED controller to all the factory included White LED's in this as well as 3d printing a front I/O plate or cover for this thing, as soon as I complete the RYZEN build I'm working up... As for it on its own, it is an affordable AIO and case combo that so long as is assembled fully does its job and looks pretty cool doing it too for a really good price.",3,3
N82E16811853040,11-853-040,2/16/2017 2:37:45 PM,Charles O.,"Head-turning case, and nice features",4," * Little extra features, like rubber isolation stands for the power supply.* Stunning looks* New model that makes access to the motherboard easier, and cable management locations"," * Some video cards might require some finesse using the vertical mount, and adjusting the standoff height of the riser card* To that point: The riser and PCI-e extension seem to be hit or miss. Mine missed. Currently trying to find a solution, as Newegg shows the cable out of stock and won't exchange without an entire return of the case. * Pulsing fan and case lights only work at higher fan speed, from what I've found. Anything under about 1750 rpm, and they go dormant. * Back panel doesn't actually lock into place on the bottom - only the front tab actually hooks anywhere, the rest of the bottom section is only held in the ""flush"" position once the rear screw is in place. There are tabs on the panel itself, but only one on the case."," Love the look of this case. Installation was a breeze, and the ability to hide cables and manage them well out of sight is nice. I've seen some reviews where they complain about the angled cutout and seeing cables behind, but it doesn't take any effort to arrange cables out of view.I only ran into a couple things: One, was my above-mentioned issue with the PCI-e riser card for vertical mounting. With an EVGA GTX 1070 FTW, for example, it doesn't fit exactly lined up, so it takes some muscle to get the thumbscrew in place to hold the card in. I also had to back out two standoffs about 1/16"" to get the card to sit level and allow for full insertion. Not something that you notice unless you know it's there, but it was what I had to do.The other thing, and this was something I couldn't figure out until Google helped: The lights that pulse for the CPU block and the front panel behind the reservoir don't seem to light until the fan speed hits a certain RPM - from what I found, it appears to be about 1750. Then, the faster the fans, the ""longer"" the pulse stays on. While that's great for seeing fan speed at a glance I guess, I would've preferred the option to have that going full-time regardless of fans. The case would be almost completely silent if I could run it in auto mode full-time, but doing that lets the light go dormant. Since it's such a prominent feature for the case, it seems silly to not have that option.And, THIS CASE DOES INCLUDE THERMAL PASTE COMPOUND!!!! Every review and unboxing I have seen, show peeling the backing paper off the water block, but no where have I seen mentioned that it does include thermal paste as well, separately in the bag of hardware. I lost mine from home before my order arrived, so I was panicking trying to find more only to find some in the case. A relief, but I wish I had known. So yes, everything is included!",1,1

Myself, I am taking a pass as SLI will be a near future goal for my rig, but great if its a feature you think you'll appreciate. -Practically silent operation in stock configuration."," -While the openness is a benefit I appreciate, with the, for lack of better word, ""metal webbing"" sitting angularly fromthe motherboard and the front of case does promote good airflow (especially if you plan to install additional fans in front)this also exposes a number of cables for open view, so plan to bring your cable management A-Game if you don't wantto see a rat's nest at certain angles.- The ""breathing"" light on the front helix reservoir is a wee bit dim. Personally I think it benefits from some additional back lighting which I achieved with 2 additional DeepCool TF 120mm white led fans to maintain a base brightness level and ramp up a bit with the inbuilt pulsing light.- The rear case fan is notably slower than the fans on the rads, or the nearly spec'ed DC TF 120 fans I added in front. In hindsight I wish I had ordered a third TF 120 for both performance and aesthetics reasons.- DeepCool's website had quite a few additional images of this case, some of which showed 4 SSD drive trays on the back side of the case, behind the motherboard. Mine arrived with only 2. I would have gladly traded the vertical mount VGA ribbon riser interface to have had the 4 I saw in the image on the manufacturer's website.- Installation of the motherboard is a bit of a pain with one of the wire's running to the CPU block running through the back of the motherboard plate to the font of the case. A pair of helping hands makes this portion of installation much easier. Alternately you could pop loose the quick connect portion of the wire, but mine was to tightly fitted together I didn't want to risk any damage to it.- While most of the cable routing process is a breeze, I would definitely recommend running your 4 or 8 pin CPU power cable before installing the motherboard. Otherwise the fit may be so tight you'll have to route that cable via alternate means and paths.- The rear motherboard panel can sit at a bit of an off angle for installing your CPU cooler bracket from the rear on some motherboards, so its advisable to install the cooling block bracket on your motherboard first before installing it in your case. Not so much of true con, but worth noting for those of you out there that might be used to doing it the other way around."," Overall the product performs terrifically. It's an amazing bang for the buck if you're in the market for both a case and a really solid liquid cooling system. This case definitely has a fair more elbow room than my previous Zalman Z9 case, which really cramped my EVGA SuperNova G2 850 watt PSU substantially. Now it seems as if components have a bit more room to breathe than in my previous Mid-Tower solution. The liquid cooling system certainly seemed to outperform my previous liquid cooler, the Lepa AquaChanger 240 not only in overall temperatures by roughly 4 degrees C on average, but also in the time it took for temperatures to rise. Other than my mostly aesthetic gripes, I am 100% satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend it. DeepCool put together a really solid product with this one.",7,7

The liquid cooled feature is very nice and there is no assembly required for it to work. The chassis hides cables well including a nice spot for the PSU to be tucked away and almost fully out of site for a clean look. The lights that shine down from the top fans in the chassis provide a great view as if you were looking at something on display. Overall it's a very nice chassis and worked perfectly for my needs., The only thing negative I have to say about the chassis is due to the liquid cooler. The liquid cooler that was built into the chassis ended up leaking onto my GPU causing it to become defective., Deepcool worked with me through the RMA process that I did with the chassis.

Come to find out, this device had sprung a slight leak, not enough to damage anything but enough to corrode the copper heat plate and supply the pump with enough 'air' so it wouldn't circulate. So, the air blocked the pump, the liquid wouldn't move, and the heat stayed on the CPU.... had this been a much worse leak, this would not be the only item being replaced"," - given this item was non-functional and way past warranty and rma, i disassembled it to see what had gone wrong. There is a big rubber plug directly behind the copper heat plate that had either become misaligned or had assembled this way allowing the smallest amount to seep by and evaporate, therefore not causing any real damage- The CPU is separated from the coolant by a heat plate, a small rubber oring that itself looked questionable, and a big rubber plug, overall the design of this product could have been a bit better and QA could use much improving- My recommendation would be to go with a cooler from corsair, ie the H100i, H110i, or H115i. I myself went with the H115i and I'm lovin it! They are a bit more difficult to install but the overall build quality is 100x better than this cooler",1,2

The fans are amazing and push so much air without being too loud. The water block itself seems very high quality and looks amazing with the LED logo. And this is SO MUCH cheaper than other brands. $70 on sale with a $20 rebate? It's a steal. 120mm rad AIOs cost this much, 240mm ones even more."," Since I have an AMD chip, I had to swap out the mounting brackets on the CPU block for AMD ones.

Gaming with Ashes of the Singularity ( a CPU intensive game) yields temps in the mid 30s with a high of around 40c on occasion. An overclock of 4.4 on my I5 6600K, playing the same game, will give me temps in the  mid 40s with an occasional spike to 50.

I wasn't one into fancy lights or other enchantments, but the Vegas style fan with their multiple light settings quickly grew on me. Outside of mesmerizing the eyes with its fan, the 120S is a solid built liquid cooler. The tubing gives the impression of being rather fragile until you handle it and discover it is actually very durable. The fittings attaching the tubing to the water block seem very solid and stay put once you get them to the position you need them at. At first glance the water block-pump looks cheaply plastic, but doesn't feel cheap in any way and is very well made. The copper mounting face was very smooth and well machined and came with a heavy peel-able plastic protective sheet. The cooling radiator is also well machined (deficient of any imperfections like nicks, burs, or bummed seams) and measures in at a depth of roughly 32mm (slightly thicker than others in 120S competitive class). Installation was very strait forward and Enermax provided adequate hardware and instructions for even the most novice installer. I have read a few comments referencing about noise from the pump, however I have never had such issues with mine. I have mine cooling an overclocked FX-8370 with no issues. It does a very dependable job of  heat transference. Overall, I give the  Enermax Liqmax 120S my five EGGS for being more than just and old face with fancy lights. It offers an affordable step-up alternative to air cooling that doesn't break the bank.", None so far.,,None,None

It kept my FX 8350 under 60 degrees Celsius during extremely processor intensive games, and it idled around 30 degrees in an average temperature room. Not to mention the blue fan looks very dazzling. Something to make your friends jealous."," Had this for over a year, and the pump has decided that cooling the surface of the sun, all day every day, was too much. In other words, the pump died. I wouldn't attribute this to faulty hardware, as my computer was often moved more than the average laptop, and I wasn't always very careful with it, which is why I didn't remove an egg.Installation was simple, except for the part where you have to attach the cooling block to the CPU. The springs were every firm, and I found that I had to really wrestle this thing on.The radiator fan is very cheap, and putting it on the highest setting was equal to suddenly starting up a vacuum cleaner. On low, it is better, however there is a noticeable change in temperature.  I would recommend getting a Higher quality fan if noise is something that you like to keep low."," Overall, aside from the radiator fan, this is a very well built liquid cooling unit, and it is very good at its job.

I was looking to built a rather quiet computer, so I went with a case with only larger (120 mm and 140 mm) fans, a graphics card with two larger fans, so that no fan needs to run at high and noisy speeds.  That strategy was successful except that the noisiest part of the computer is now usually the liquid pump.  It makes an audible humming sound that is louder than any fan."," The liquid cooler does its cooling job well.  I mounted it to an i7-5820K processor, using Arctic Silver thermal paste rather than the included thermal grease.  On a Gigabyte X99 UD5 wifi motherboard the processor never gets critically hot even overclocked to 4.2 GHz, and the fan speed for the fan that came with the Liqmax 120 is only set to medium.  Thus, the cooler does what it is designed for, but look elsewhere if you want a really quiet liquid cooler.",5,6

Forget the fans, the pump sounds like a refrigerator and is louder in the room than my refrigerator. Not exaggerating. And, it is in a well acoustically insulated case. The grating whine is transmitted through the structure because the pump is hard mounted to the CPU/board.The radiator is listed as 32mm thick, true, but the actual core is only 17.6mm thick, one mm thicker than the core in the 25mm Corsair (for instance).

Which in turn throttles the fan speed accordingly. so turn that feature off before you rate a product poorly. the fan is a PWM fan which is throttled by the cooling profiles used by the bios to keep the system cool as needed. the pump runs at full speed as it is only a three pin connector with no throttling capability.

I was wrong. I installed my cooler and realized that none of the lights were working on the liquid reservoir or the cpu block. It was a bad splitter, I decided to live with it. For a couple weeks it kept my cpu approximately 10c above ambient at idle and did well with stress/heat tests.Then, started getting a high-pitched whine. Not loud but it was there. A few days later, mu PC began stuttering and hitching . The issue was the water pump on this cooler. It had completely stopped and my brand new i7-6700 was at 97c and throttling down to prevent meltdown.I tried unhooking it from the splitter and hooking it directly to my motherboards water pump header, still no workey.Swiftech tech support was very helpful, they had a new unit tested in in the mail a couple days later. I installed the new cooler and was happy, everything seemed to work. .....Now I have an issue emerging on the replacement: The pump will emit a loud clicking noise. It happens at startup. I go to my fan software and speed it up, then slow it back down and it is fine.This doesn't happen every time, but still has me worried about another pump failure.So.....a cpu cooler that fails to reliably cool a cpu. Yes, tech support is very helpful but if I had it to do over, I would rather not have to go through the whole RMA process then having to tear my PC down for pump replacement.

The pump is great, the CPU block is very well designed and looks great. The fans are not loud, and it is easy to expand the loop and add radiators and other water blocks. I really wanted this as my CPU cooler for my FX-9590. The cooler looked fantastic in my case, the LEDs were great, the looks were fantastic. It looked and felt like a premium product.However..."," However, The reservoir is NOT to be trusted. The first H220x2 I bought cracked after 5 days of operation, leaking half the coolant onto my cross fired R9290x cards, significantly damaging the top card. The coolant has some additive that eats solder. It cracked from the base of the pump housing across the front of the reservoir. I had not added anything to the coolant, had not expanded the loop although I had intended on adding a radiator. It was either unnoticed damage from shipping or a manufacturing flaw. The second cooler after new egg kindly accepted the RMA, also cracked. After nearly 2 weeks of operation, and just as I was starting to feel like, I got a good one everything will be fine. It cracked. At first I didn't notice it. There are 2 screws that hold the acrylic reservoir onto the metal bracket. The crack started there so it was not immediately noticeable. It was only after I noticed to my horror there was drops of coolant on my video cards that I realized the second H220x2 had cracked.Two back to back reservoir failures has made me loose faith in swiftech coolers. Which sucks. I really wanted this cooler, and I really wanted to like it. but when it leaks all over video cards twice, and both times with less than a month of running can you really trust it? "," I would not recommend this product due to the back to back reservoir failures, and I would not buy it again. I really wanted to have this as my cooler, but I cannot trust the product again. right now I am debating to go all in and build a completely custom loop or to get a different AIO.

A friend and I moved my system to a new case and put this in to find that the LEDs didn't work, no big deal right?  I called Swiftech and was quickly sent out a new PWM splitter to see if that would remedy the situation, it didn't.  They issued an RMA but I had to ship it back on my own dime which cost me a decent amount of money via UPS, more than I had wanted to spend on this cooler.  I got the new unit today, put it in my rig and powered everything up and booted into BIOS, while checking around the system I came back to a display that read 70 C on the CPU  for an Intel 4790k.  I quickly powered everything down and discovered that the pump wasn't working.  I tried different SATA connections and cables but nothing worked.  I am incredibly frustrated , I was hoping to finally have my expensive rig back up and running today but now I have to wait for a new pump to come, which will mean removing the system and draining it.

Had to take it off with pliers :l- If you connect the reset switch to the pwm hub for LED controlls, sometimes it works others it doesnt. Not sure if it's my case or the header. - May not fit in the top, and if you have to put it in the front, the resevoir will face away from you, pretty disappointed in that (atleast for the Corsair 400c)- Took me entire bottle of red to get it where i wanted because tubes are hazy and make the liquid look lighter."," Some of the reviews are stating that the LED on the cpu block are not working, but from my experience it works perfectly fine, along with any other LED. Everything on my unit works perfectly as intended. If you're new to water cooling, then this is possibly NOT the route for a starter kit. Installation was ""okay"" and was a little rough and confusing due to poor instructions. Its just images...no text or anything like that. I installed it into an AMD system and in order to do that, you have to remove the screws from the cpu bracket, which was a PAIN. There are rings hold it on and they are super hard to get off. Adding dye was easy (for the most part). The fill port cap is EXTREMELY tight and will likely require pliers or something like that. Tried a penny, almost bent the penny... Theres also not a whole lot of space in the resevoir to add a lot of dye, so if you intend to do a purple or something you will likely need to drain some water (only a little). In my case, the Corsair 400c, it was impossible to mount at the top, and the only other option i had was the front. I tried  to get the resevoir to face me like its suppose to but had no luck. I suspect i'll have to move my graphics card down a slot to make that happen but then it'd just look dumb (imo). So i had to put it in the case with the resevoir (and the LEDs) facing the back of the case.Overall the build experience was ""Okay"" and I'd recommend it as the next step up from any other AIO solution like the Corsair H100i or closed loop coolers like it. It looks good and keeps the computer cool, but not as cool as my Corsair H100i GTX, so I suspect something isn't right, which I'll probably be looking into after this. Thanks for reading!",3,4

Make sure you have both top and side mounts incase one or the other does not work!  Ran in to an issue using the NZXT S340, didn't fit with a XFX R9 390 card.  Replaced the case with a Corsair 400C.The PWM switch was dead on arrival.

Won't let my 4790K go above 80 at max symthetic load with fans and pump full blast (I like to keep it at PWM controlled silence mode). I like that it is expandable, although the most I would ever consider doing is add in a 980ti water blocked edition in the distant future."," Received mine from the initial batch that had the spiltter that was broken that would not provide LED or PWM. Contacted Swiftech and they sent me another one and it worked for a while and then now the PWM is flaky, so I am not using the splitter for PWM.  Unable to remove fans to make it a top intake (unable to reach screws to remove fans.) Mine came with bubbles in it, and they come and go, possibly due to the fill port not being 100% air tight or possibly due to the res not being filled 100%."," I like the res and the LEDs. I was going for a BLUE theme and this gave me the blue I was looking for.  What I don't like is the way the controller was soldered together; it is prone to weakness at the solder point if there is no slack in the wire which is what happened to me with the PWM cable. Not going to request a new splitter again as I will use my motherboard to do the PWM and a Y splitter. My wish is that I could flip the fans to intake cool air into the case to cool the rad. I also wish this thing wasn't so heavy, so it would be easier to do a top mount. Overall 3 egg score due to bad splitter and heaviness/hardness to mount. Would I purchase one again?

Major improvement for my setup (note 3770K does run hot out of the box from my experience)- Great customer support from Swiftech and Ren!  I had to ask a question about how i installed it, as i was getting no fan power, and supported answered my email within a few hours and immediately just shipped me a new pwm splitter.  Turns out, the one i received was bad.  Very pleased- While this may be taboo to some water cooling experts, the dye included in the AIO works really well.  I used the blue and with the my LED lights plus those included on the water block and the pump, it looks amazing IMO.- For a person who isn't new to water cooling using All In Ones, but has never done a custom loop, this AIO is definitely a great start.  It looks extremely easy to expand, which i will to my video card next year, just as Swiftech stated.  But to my surprise, the parts included are actually very solid.  - The thermo paste included was higher quality than most other AIOs usually include-  I will not say the PWM splitter is garbage as others have because I received a bad one.  The one that they RMA me worked immediately after installing and hasn't had any issues since.- Runs extremely quiet when using CPU header, and splitter to control"," - Installing the WATER BLOCK - When you install this on the proc, take your time.  As stated by others the screws included are a bit short which makes it kind of tricky.  It did properly install with a good contact on my LGA1155, but i feel a second set of hands would have helped drastically.  Make sure you take your time!"," - The instructions were more of a quick start guide for a user like myself.  I am very paranoid when installing because of previous experience installing a different brand AIO.  I would have liked there to be more detailed information available online for this specific unit.  However, i know i did purchase it right when it came out and Swiftech did answer my questions on both Overclock forums and via email, so my experience was fine.- This is all opinion, but the fans included in the non prestige model were not my favorite.  However, I am biased as i always want to mount fans on the top of the case as exhaust.  That being said, I did flip the fans over and use them as pull through the rad and exhaust out the top.  Yes i know that i may get criticism for that, but i was actually surprised to find that my case setup with that configuration did not suffer any noticeable temp increases.  But because of that, i would have really liked to have gotten the fans included in the prestige model as they are wider blades and overall just seem like they would work better.  Tried to install my corsair fans in the exact same config as the included fans but pulling through the rad, but the screws included + my stock of C R A P (newegg highlighted this word and stated i couldn't submit this review with it included! HAHAHA) did not contain long enough ones.-Overall, i am very pleased with this unit and would highly recommend it to water cooling enthusiasts who may not be ready like myself to jump straight to custom open looped systems.",1,1

Oh and dont get your hopes up about the leds. After some research and now personal exp, the leds have a tendency of not working. At all.. I doubt both sets of leds just happen to be bad. Its more likely the 3, and 4 pin pwr splitter at fault. Though the 4 pins do provide power to the fans and pump, no joy on the 3 pins for leds. Next problem.. For the life of me i could not fit and attach the amd adapters onto the brackets of the contact plate. Which was an Undeniable speed bump.But after a close look i could see the brackets were not aligned properly.

Thermal paste that is included will do the trick just fine unless you have higher quality tim laying around.

It seems faulty pumps aren't so rare on the H220 series but they aren't a common problem either. It may just be my luck that I got a faulty unit. YES! I tapped/flicked the water lines, tilted the whole thing and unscrewed fill hole to try and release air or air bubbles and none were present. The system is CLEAN and free of air. The pump is louder than my few years old cooler master seidon 240m & H60, so yeah.. I also have my build enclosed in a Fractal R5 and with the case doing a great job at keeping everything silent, the pump is all that I hear. The fans don't need to go any higher than 35-40% and at that setting they are dead silent."," I have two fractal venturie 140mm fans in the front, one in the rear and that's it.The fans on my GTX 980 don't spin until 60c is reached and my EVGA G2 750W with eco mode the fan is also ""dead"" until a certain temp is reached. My computer in my honest opinion is very very quiet.. I at first thought it was a faulty fan or something else in the case but after opening the side panel it was definitely the pump.

Last year, I upgraded to a M5A99X and FX-8350 processor when my motherboard died but kept my case that I've had since 2003. I used the AMD stock cooler because I had no need for overclocking. Between that cooler, the fan on the side of the case, and the fore and aft fans, it could get quite loud.Some of the reviews of this cooler had me a bit worried that I had traded UP in terms of loudness, but that is simply not the case. Speaking of cases, my Tsunami Wave (with the plexi side door) had clearance issues, so I could not mount the radiator. The new case is a ThermalTake Commander G42. Yes, it is loud, if you turn it all the way up. Anyone would expect two fans pushing and pulling lots of air through a miniature radiator to be loud. However, it's virtually silent while idling and barely noticeable when it's under moderate load. Plus, my idle temps have gone from 95°-115°F (depending on cleanliness of heatsink) to 69.1°. I like the LED temperature indication, too. Even running 3D Mark, it barely moved from cool blue."," The rubber spacers that move the mounting arms from AMD to Intel spacing are a pain. The directions seem to indicate that you should slide them into the side where they absolutely will not stay. Slide them into the top and they'll stick.It was difficult to install this with the motherboard mounted in the case. I scotch taped the threaded inserts to the back of the backing plate. In retrospect, using the AMD backing plate would have been much, much easier. The thumbscrews are difficult to install while keeping everything lined up, so I'd advise doing it outside of the case or having a helper assist you.Still, highly recommended."," If I had known that I was going to get a new case, I probably would have opted for the Kuhler 1250, just because.",None,None

It also does a great job at keeping my FX-9370 in check. The only problem is the fan/pump noise. It seems to turn the speeds up pretty quickly, like just surfing the web will be cause for excessive compensation of the fans. You can set the speed through the included software but even with the slider turned all the way down for fanspeed, it insists on keeping the fans between 1000-1300rpm (which is very audible). Even as I write this, the slider is set to 600rpm but the fans are at 1100rpm. There's no reason for them to be that fast right now. If only there was a way to change the threshold of when the unit starts turning the fans up, like with speedfan, then I would definitely give this 5 stars. So you get great performance at the price of loud operating volume. But the unique design makes it stand out from the pack. It looks fantastic through the window of my case, and since everything is sideways (Silverstone Raven RV05 case), it really stands out. It's really nice to be able to change the color on the waterblock to match the red lights in the case. Or you can set it to change color (from light blue to red) depending on the coolant temperature, which is pretty cool. All in all, I am very satisfied with the performance but I have hopes that Antec will improve the software to allow for more customization of temperature thresholds.",None,None

Having four extra rubber points that need clamping means you have four extra leakage points!It also forces the end user to have the air flow blowing the internal cases hot air onto the radiator which I always thought was a stupid design!Replacing bad fans is not possible with the pump mounted on one of them!No matter what cooler you pick with the new design it looks as though the air is pushed out from within your case.I personally never believed in that methodology. I reverse that and have the cool air from outside my case blowing in with much better results.," I currently am still running the older version of this cooler and it's a better design for several reasons!The older design only has four hose connection points as opposed to eight which is just a better design to eliminate leakage.The older design also allows the end user to reverse the fans to have the cool air outside your case to be pulled in thru the radiator which makes a lot more sense!This is not the cooler I was looking for and I returned it from a different vender.I am disappointed that I need to use a much larger top mounted case cooler to get better cooling in the future over my current Antec H20 920!If my current coolers pump fails I would also need a new system but it's been working great for over 3 years now!It's basically give and take with closed loop coolers. Antec has moved the pump onto a fan which is a bad idea with the extra 4 clamps that were not needed with the older design.I have been very happy with my H2O 920 and if it need to be replaced I would be forced to buy a much larger radiator with the twin fans. I would also need to add to fans of my own for a good push pull effect.It looks as though Corsair has new tubing that matches this tubing exactly. So the big question is will the Corsairs USB controlled software work as well as my current H2O 120's software does?From what I have read it seems like I need to wait until Antec , Thermaltake, or Corsair gets some better ideas for there coolers.I just hope my current H2O 920 holds up for a few more years!",0,1

I have 2 of these, getting the 1250 for next build gaming machine. At idle these are about as loud as a large air cpu cooler, but they quickly ramp up under load and get pretty loud, but the confidence of a cool cpu outweighs a little bit of noise.

Although perhaps not the quietest solution, it is worth it to me for getting rid of the questionable practice of putting an electromagnetic device (a powerful electric water pump) DIRECTLY on the CPU, or having to go the full nine yards and go with a full-blown water loop. I believe I have observed a water pump (from the 'other guys' that make all-in-one water coolers) which mount directly on the CPU cause some sort of interference to integrated graphics firsthand. Whether it was a proper observation or not, -just the risk of any kind of unwanted corruption was enough to sell me on Antec's design!

Fluid type?  Raijintek has stated that changing the fluid will void the warranty.  Why?  I was told Mayhem's pastel coolant was too thick (even though it has the consistency of water) and would ruin the pump.  6.  A few people I know that have purchased this have found debris in the rad.  I really needs a good flush before use.  But since doing so would void the warranty, its pointless.7.  There is a lot of air in this system out of the box.  No cracks, no leaks, tons of air.8.  The hose size fittings are not quite 3/8 x 1/2 which makes it just under standard.9.  Thermal paste.

Very quiet even on middle and high settings.," Installation can be slightly tricky, see ""Other"" below for a tip.Would prefer a more accessible means of fan speed selection, not worth deducting an egg."," I was looking for a liquid AIO cooler since I have begun to run some 64-bit software for spreadsheets with a lot of complex calculation fields. These can take several hours to over 24 hours to process and can place the CPU at 100 percent for long periods. Running the stock Intel cooler, I checked my temps via CPUID HW Monitor, and when I was running two of the sheets, I saw the CPU hit a peak of 82 degrees before I closed one of the programs. Temps then were around 70 degrees. I did some research and found this setup, which appeared would fit into my older (2013) Gigabyte GZ-G2 mid tower and socket 1150 i5-4690K CPU. The case already had a 120mm fan at the rear of the case (prior U/G from 80mm). Installation was really easy. The instructions were clear and well-illustrated. The only part that presented a problem was getting the base plate to stay in place so I could place the standoffs and then the block with pump. I used a length of blue painters tape across the plate to hold it to the MB, and this held it in place long enough to place the standoffs and loosely set the block. I was then able to place one spring nut on at a time and then tighten them per the instructions by placing my finger on each one as I installed the spring nut.I wired the fans via their Y-cable to the MB SYS FAN2 header and the pump to the CPU fan header. I tried middle and high speed settings and did not hear any difference. It appears they are being PWM'd, as HW Monitor shows SYS2 fan at 800~850 RPM while at idle. My seat of the pants noise level estimate is about the same as the single 120mm I had there before.Once installed, I found the 120mm top side case fan would not clear, so I removed it. The system worked very well. I opened the same two files and saw the CPU temp never went above 55 degrees- a 27 degree drop. I'm seeing idle temps of 32-35 degrees. The parts appear to be quality, the fans have anti-vibration pads on each corner, and the radiator and block are quality material. My system tends to run 18~20 hours/day so I'll be interested to see how well it holds up over time.Even w/o the rebate, Newegg had the best deal on this.Win7 Ultimatei5-4690K not OC'd16GB G.Skill DDR3 1600GIGABYTE GZ-G2 mid tower",1,1

The radiator is pretty high quality, rubber coated aluminum and just feels solid. The hoses are pretty stiff, but solid. The pump is also pretty huge, but that's ok, just more capacity to pull heat away. The fans it comes with are also of high quality. You can even select the fan speed on the fan itself.

The 1st one from another company lasted about 2 years till a freak mishap with my cases top mounted fan.  =(  Well, took a chance on the Liqmax II. I like the thing.  Its pretty well thought design and feeling legit in terms of construction.  It comes with everything you need to mount to either an intel or AMD chip to include the thermal paste.  the Fans have 3 settings to draw hot air to and away from the radiator.  Its a nice touch.  Have only used the middle setting and works quite well with the radiator.  Idle temps for the CPU have been around 30C (low of 28C), while under full load and a mild overclock about 52C.  Which is great for 70 bucks."," I did have a tad of difficulty during the install of the mounting hardware to the mother board.  It came in 2 flavors.  The instructions are vary limited on text instructions and while the diagrams are overall well done, did leave a couple things fuzzy on the install.  This is the only reason for 4 eggs and not 5.  Simply more info on which way things need to point, if that makes sense.  But do not let that put you off.  I find it a really good close loop cooler so far."," It seems well made and well thought out piece of kit.  Quite happy with it so far.  While it does make some noise from the fans and pump, its way less than that stock cooler I was running. That thing sounded like a fully loaded 747 taking off under load.  This guy is more like a puny little cesna.  If I where to buy again I would buy the larger liqmaxII.  I have a feeling you could really push an overclock with that guy.    I have a feeling I will be using this cooler for some time.",4,4

Relatively quiet for a unit with two 120mm fans. Cools my system very well, though I have not yet done any overclocking.", Quality control on mounting hardware included was terrible. It supposedly came with the needed hardware to mount on several different motherboard types in both the Intel and AMD families. These typically require offset screws of different lengths. The offset screws labeled for my particular setup (AM3+) had the wrong thread pitch on one end. Upon closer inspection I discovered that only one of the several sets of offset screws was machined in a way that would allow them to secure the pump firmly above ANY CPU and it was not of the prescribed length for my AM3+ Mobo. It was very frustrating trying to start the offset screws that just would'nt start before the close inspection that revealed that the threads were just wrong..," With my particular setup, I was eventually able to make the properly threaded, but slightly too long Intel offset screws work. Obviously, if the pump heat transfer plate is not held in proper contact with the CPU because the offset screws are too long, you will defeat the whole purpose and have overheating issues. If you use such a workaround, be careful. Shimming of the back plate may be necessary. I am pleased with my final results, but very displeased that I had to re-engineer what should have been a working package to make it work. Product is designed in Switzerland but assembled/packaged on China. Final Chinese quality control strikes again.",0,1

Fans are quite silent, and the pump, well it's impossible to tell if it is running, even at full speed (5,300 rpm).Both fans have Y splitter cables, so they can be dasychained with the pump to use a single fan header. Since fans and pump behaves differently, I connected the pump to the Asus pump header so it is possible in the AISuite to give it a different profile, and to see the actual speed of the pump (I'd rather keep the pump running above 75% of max speed, while the fans can be throttles down to 40% in light load conditions)"," I guess the radiator tapped holes were not protected adequately during the painting process, so the srews were hard to get in for the first time.

To avoid this, simply install and remove the screws once in the radiator holes prior to the installation. making sure not to go to far and damage the fins."," Bought this unit in replacement of a Corsair H80i which never worked adequately, mainly due to their buggy Link software.

I tried it with the top fan pushing air from the top of case, but realized the rear facing LEPA 120mm was getting all its air from the CPU and Graphics Card waste heat.  I turned the 200mm fan upside down to push cool air into the radiator.  Made a 5C difference in temp.  Now the air swirls around and blows out the front top of the HAF 912.  Very cool inside.  I am not convinced a 240mm radiator would be much cooler than this setup with a constant cool air feed to the radiator fan from the top down, instead of pulling waste heat from the CPU, graphics cards, PSU, memory, and PCH into the radiator.The hoses are uber fat so I moved my dual b.skill Trident memory over one slot just to keep it cooler.   The trident memory fit no problem, but I just gave it some space for more air flow.Running SIV, the pump and the fan in front of the radiator tracks temps very well.

Red LED on the cooler is great and the elbows for the tubes on the pump itself do swivel.," 2 things I can list off that I didn't like.1) The mounting hardware issue. The mounting screws have springs on them and the carriage bolt to hold itself in place while mounting. Issue is that the pushing of the springs in screws will ""unseat"" the bolts from the back plate! Also the back plate is made of a softer material that doesn't hold the carriage bolt in place very well. My opinion is with the money you save is to get some sort of better mounting bolts with a Phillips head for easier mounting.2) Elbows on the side of the pump part of the cooler with the LEPA logo mounted reading left to right pushed on my nearest ram. So much after having it mounted for a few hours I decided to remove the mounting (insert hardware issue here) and remount the pump in a vertical position. Still works GREAT but not ideal for showcasing.", If I were to be super picky I would ask that LEPA come out with either a RBG LED version.

On Prime95, I was hitting 75C after just a 2 minutes with a SilenX Effizio EFZ-80HA3 heatsink, with idle hovering between 35-38C. With the same set up but using an EVO 212 cooler, I was hitting 65C, with idle between 28-32C. However, with the EVO, I was unable to close the top lid of my Core V1 case, as the copper tubes and fins extruded about .8cm too high. After some research, I bought the LEPA cooler. After starting up and letting the computer idle for 5 minutes, the temperature sat at 28C. I then ran Prime95 and the highest temperate hit 58C after 5 minutes. Ambient temperature in my house is (+/-1) 25C. All of my test are ran non-OCed. Under regular usage (and by that I mean heavy gaming such as GTAV, Skyrim, FarCry 4, etc), I have not seen temps above 52C on UTX graphs. Just for comparison, I would hit low 60Cs for the same games with the EFZ-80HA3 and high 50Cs with the EVO 212. Unlike the stress tests, you’d rarely hit these temps in games and if so, they would be in very short periods. As far as noise goes, it’s very tolerable. At idle, you can barely hear the fan/air.

I guess that means it's doing its job!- Can't change the color on the LED on the heatsink to any other color than red, but I knew that going in and was fine with it.- Slightly difficult install (explained below)."," - Just a heads up, make sure it will fit in your case, I measured mine before I ordered it and knew it would fit but it needs a fair amount of room for the hoses and such. The hoses coming off the heatsink barely touch my memory (I have 4 sticks) and while not a concern, it made me nervous at first. Also, installing this on your own could be tricky, for AMD users anyway in my experience, because the screws that come with the product that enter from the back of the motherboard don't ""lock"" in place or anything, and when you install the heatsink part with the thermal paste, it could be pretty easy to have those slide out the backside while trying to line everything up and press down accurately all at the same time. Luckily, I had a friend over while I was doing this and he held the four screws against the motherboard while I pressed down the heatsink and tightened the spring screws. I highly recommend finding another person to help you with this install for that reason alone. Also, the spring screws are really hard to get on at first, especially if you have anything less than a full tower case (I have a mid tower), and it was a tight squeeze to get my fingers in there far enough to start two of the spring screws. Also, don't over-tighten the spring screws too much, or you'll start bending the mounting bracket on the back of the motherboard like I did. In the end, the slight bends made me feel like it was on the CPU more securely, but I'm glad I stopped tightening when I did. Other than the install being a little difficult, it was totally worth it!

N82E16835494018,35-494-018,3/14/2016 2:16:22 PM,Chuck M.,Won't fit,1, I have none.  It looks like a very solidly made unit.," The 1 egg is not against the operation of the unit, since I was unable to get it to fit into any case I have, but ONLY due to the following reasons.  I went to install the radiator, which is 4-3/4"" x 6"", in the fan slots in my case and found the following problems:1 - The radiator is very wide.  I ran into the problem with it fitting into the standard exhaust fan locations on standard width mid and tall towers.2 - The mounting holes don't line up with any existing holes in any case I have.  These holes measure 4"" x 4"" apart, and have to fit very flush against the case in order for the short screws to reach the holes.As a side note be aware, as some have indicated here, that the hoses are very stiff and inflexible, and only 11"" from the CPU heat sink to the radiator.There are others that have written reviews here that obviously have been able to get this cooler to work.  I would be curious as to what type of a case they have, since due to the radiator size it seems most standard cases will have problems getting the radiator to fit, with the proper hole alignment. "," I would recommend this cooler, since it is a solidly built unit, but I suggest using the dimensional information I indicated to see if it will work in your case.  I hope this helps anyone interested in this unit.",2,3

I had just bought an i7-4790k and my computer was not prepared for that, even with good quality thermal paste and my Antec CPU cooler it was running way, way too hot. My CPU, under load & boosted to 4.4ghz (not overclocked mind you, it has built in turbo-boost) maxes out at 42 degrees celsius (107 degrees F), but playing most games it doesn't break 37 degrees C, the standard operating temp is only 32 degrees C. I mean a i7-4790k running at under 100 degrees F during normal usage, and even some non cpu intensive games, is pretty impressive. I was debating this, a Corsair H60 or 80, or a Cooler Master, but I am happy with my choice, very happy. The tubing is impressive & seems very high quality in thickness and material. Also the lighting is a neat side effect, sadly my case is set up for all blue LEDs, so my next move is a new case, motherboard, and SSD or Hybrid drive, running out of space!"," I did have some instillation issues but this was my own fault, I did not consider that the radiator was obviously larger than the fan, it gives the dimensions right on the webpage, so I had to install it at the top of my case instead of the standard exhaust.

My CPU now idles around 35c and under load hits 43c.

The water lines going into the pump can't be adjusted as far as I can tell, or at least I didn't want to snap them off trying.Also the water pump housing is a little on the wide side for my GA990-XA-UD3 motherboard.

The size allows additional placement options not available with 240mm units. Overclocking my amd CPU from 3.4Ghz to 4.0Ghz as a trial run. The temps. on the MB was 25C and the CPU never passed 47C. That is with the Liqtech unit's fans set at medium and the case fans on low. Very please with purchase. Plans of adding another unit to cool GPU in the future.," The cons are valid, but I am not removing any eggs for them due to the unit performing wonderfully. The first con is the AMD backplate used to replace the AMD type is seems very cheaply made and I had a difficut time keeping the pins lined up and not falling out.The second con is the fans while having three different speed settings but the switch for them is located very near the blades and motor making it very problematic to adjust on the fly. The switches should be external with a wired switch like several brands of case fans available."," I read many reviews posted by others before purchasing this unit. There were comments made about the screws being to short to mount the fans to the readiator through the case wall. I had not such issues. True, they do not provide any extra threads, but they are long enough.",1,1

Northbridge seemed to run HOT at 63, but even AsRock has no clue what that reading is on HwMonitor.  After installing this cooler, temps start at 34 and peak at 69 Celcius. Yes. Its installed right, Artic Silver is broken in and stable. It just can't cool this CPU on this board. It will spike to 54 with NO CPU activity at all. Internet usage runs temps @ 45 constant. Gaming runs it up to 69-70 Celcius.Now.. As I don't really believe this to be just this cooler, I also lay blamb on AsRock and their  FX990 Chipset and board. I would like to see results of this cooler on a MSI 990 or any 970 board.I also blamb my older Thermaltake case. Although its big and roomy with plenty of fans, its old tech, back when chips never got this hot. So. I ordered a new THOR V2 case.. I'll post back those numbers too.I never mentioned that these temps  read the same running stock @ 4.0 and OCed @ 4.5 and 4.7 I wonder if ambient temps are playing into this in this case...

Does not require a huge case to mount the cooler and fans. Three speed settings on fans. Better radiator design and quality., As many have mentioned the screws needs to be a little longer. The switches for the fan speed cannot be changed without removing the fans from the radiator.," First off I do not often do a review but this item deserves my two cents worth. I am not an overclocker so there is not overclocking information. I have repaired and built computers for 23 years as a hobby. Over those years I have built more than 200 computers and upgraded another 100 or so with new motherboards, CPU, and memory. Most of those were for customers who just want budget computers for email, word prcessing, picture editing and browsing the Internet. A few built for power users. Not many require cooling with water but I have done two builds this year requiring water. The first was an AMD FX-9370 Vishera 4.4GHz. This CPU runs quiet a bit hotter than the AMD AMD FX-8370 Vishera 8-Core 4.0GHz so I cooled this with a top rated brand 240mm long radiator cooler. I do a lot of video encoding which maxes out the CPU's. I did some encoding for six hours. I was a little disappointed with this cooler as it idled at 32 degrees. With a 42 to 45 under normal load and maxed out at 65 degrees with six hours of video encoding. This is acceptable but I expected better.The second build was an AMD FX-9590 Vishera 8-Core 4.7GHz. Since the first build warmer than I expected I decided to use a top rated brand rated. 280mm water cooler. This cooler was much better. Idled at 29, normal load 38 to 40 and maxed out with six hours of video encoding 52 degrees. Much better results than 240mm cooler with a hotter CPU.  Water cooling has come a long way with the next generation water cooling just now becoming available. After reading about some of the latest water coolers and watching videos I really liked what I saw about the Enermax Liqtech 120X. If not for the $79 price I probably would have not ordered this cooler but I thought for the price along with the $25 rebate I would try it. Since I had a few days to play with the FX-9590 I installed the Enermax Liqtech 120X on the FX-9590 CPU. What a huge surprise, this cooler gave me the identical results of top rated 280mm cooler. Idle 29, normal load 38-42, and 52 max load for six hours.  The quality of the radiator is much better than any other water cooler I have used. Not even close. With the thicker radiator and a push/pull setup this performs as well as the much larger 280mm coolers.  I used the max rpm setting on the fans but it is no more noise than the 280mm coolers, maybe less and acceptable.  I'm highly impressed with this Enermax cooler. It's a great cooler for much less money than other coolers at any price. Looking forward to testing the next generation ENERMAX ELC-LMR120S once it becomes widely available. It requires less fan speed hopefully for the same or better results than 120X with switch settings that can be changed easily. Hopefully Enermas will give us some longer fan screws in the new model.",3,3

Fit in my IWIN BUC case perfect. Looks great and performs outstanding. Fit perfect in place of my 120mm rear case fan. I just wish I had a need for a second one cause I would buy it in a heartbeat., Now there doesn't appear to be many cons that I know. I do know that the fans screws are too short for some things like bolt up through your case to fan. Mine just made it by a hair. I wanted to put one fan outside on the back of case but the short screws prevented me from trying that. The fans are somewhat loud on the high setting but I really don't think I will even need to run this thing at high because of the cool temps at low speed. If I overclock I might need to set the speed on the second position but this is what liquid cooling is about. It keeps thing cool., I would buy again and wish I had bought this sooner.

So I disabled all the other fans in the computer and have only the Intel BXTS13X fan running. My case came with 5 fans already installed, but it was way an overkill. Again, I disabled all the other fans and have the BXTS13X running the show.  By the way, I found it much, much easier to first assemble the pump and bracket together and align them nicely on the processor (after applying the thermal paste of course) and then hold them in-place firmly on the CPU and then secure them with the nobs.

It's durable, but it's switch circuit is exposed (I actually looked it up to make certain that I hadn't received a defective fan -it's just made that way), and it doesn't move much air, even if overclocked.    Also, it can only be installed in a single orientation because of the way the mounting holes are made.The LED is nice, but overall it's better just to invest in a different fan(s)."," I bought this liquid cooling system on a very tight budget and  I didn't expect a lot of performance from one at the price range I had to work with.With the paired fan, it was maybe a bit above average for the price tag, though nothing special.  However, I uninstalled it and paired it up with high performance Enermax fan, and my ambient temperatures dropped a good 3 degrees.  I add another Enermax fan and I haven consistent idle temperatures in the low 30s.  Even gaming I've rarely seen it go much above 40.What I take away is that this little device will keep up with a LCS with a greater specc'ed performance when paired up with the right fans.  All in all, for me this has been a happy accident of finding it cheaper to use the BTS13X and a pair of good fans than it is to spend money on a much more expensive LCS that will offer comparable performance at a higher cost.System Specs:CPU:  Core i7 4790kMotherboard:  ASUS ROG MAXIMUS VII FORMULAGPU:  MSI GAMING N750Ti TF  GeForce GTX 750 Ti Memory:  4x8 GB CORSAIR Vengeance DDR3 SDRAM  Harddrive:  Axiom 507614-B21-AX 1 TBPSU:  Corsair RM Series RM850Box:  Enermax Ostrog GT ECA3280A-BR ATX Mid Tower",2,2

I have 4 of these on my gaming pc's and they do perform well with temps (27c to 31c at idle)(Intel and AMD cpu's) and at gaming loads (42c to 45c). My systems have not gone over 45c while running any of my games at all and flight sims like rise of flight and A10 warthog do push the cpu hard while running. For me this is solid performance from the cooler. With a slight overclock my temps go up by 2c to 3c depending on the system I am running at the time.I do run 2 120mm fans (cooler master jet flows) on the coolers to get best performance. As for the back plate I have not had one issue with any of my coolers at all. The back plates with this cooler have worked fine for me. You can get a kit on e bay made by the manufacture of this cooler to use it on AMD cpu's and I have 2 of them installed this way on AMD cpu's without one issue. You can even use the back plate that comes on the motherboard with these kits with AMD AM3+ cpu's.Installation was easy and I had the cooler installed in around 30 min. If you spend more you may find better performance but if your like me just gaming (world of tanks and rise of flight) and not trying to run super overclocked system this cooler will serve you well., I have found no cons with this cooler at all. The only thing even close to con is it would be easier with 2 people to install. It's hard to hold everything and start the screws in the radiator using 2 120mm fans., I have only found these kits for this cooler on e bay and they do work well for the cooler to use with AMD cpu's.Also this cooler dose not need the extra usb plug in on your motherboard other coolers need. It dose not need extra software that can have issues like some other coolers have and I have had these issues in the past with other coolers. You just install it and it works so if you want to keep things simple that should be that way check this cooler out you will love it.,9,10

I would expect the service life of the pump to be significantly longer than two years.  A good CPU core temperature monitor proved invaluable to me to track this deterioration.

All wiring was confirmed and replacement fans all would rotate properly.  Included fan was installed correctly, it was just internally wired wrong."," I spent several hours investigating the fan issue.  I've never seen a fan (especially a PWM 4 pin fan) that rotated backwards like this.  I didn't initially notice the problem till I noticed hours after installation that no heat was leaving the back of the case.  That's when I opened up the case and noticed the fan was pulling air through the radiator into the case.  I installed the typical installation with the radiator mounted at the back of the case with the fan oriented to blow air through the radiator.  The fan was oriented correctly (no spacers required in this orientation).  The pump was wired properly to the motherboard and the fan properly to the pump.  When replacing the included fan with another one (a Vortex fan), the replacement fan rotates correctly.  The included fan was just somehow internally wired to spin backwards.  Maybe a fluke, maybe a whole range of these fans were mis-manufactured.  Installers should double check proper fan rotation as this can cause excessive heat buildup in your case.  Attached video shows backwards fan rotation which is clearly a manufacturing flaw.",16,17

Not really an Issue, but there's not much clearance to see where the screw holes are at in the radiator.

I wish companies would tell you which direction the fans blow, because the only way you could tell is using incense.

The infinity mirror effect is borderline hypnotizing when looked upon for even a few seconds.," The flaw comes with CAM software which is used to not only control the pump's functionality but also user created profiles for CPU fan curves and RGB LED settings (pretty important stuff).NZXT's CAM software is in a pretty bad place right now. A list of troubling issues from full on crashes to not detecting the kraken between reboots, losing lighting profiles, you name it. It's incredibly discouraging because the hardware is nothing short of stunning. CAM has a pretty slick interface and loads of functionally but maybe tries to do a bit too much. I nearly decided to send it back and go with corsair's offering or the upcoming EVGA AIO but being vexed by its beauty I decided to seek control of the AIO outside of the CAM application. I had been hearing that CAM doesn't need to be running for your fan profiles to work but after testing I discovered that this simply is not true. The fans will run at the exact RPM last used by CAM. They will not ramp up and down with temps if CAM isn't running.SOLVED!! No CAM=No worries!! (As long as you have fan control in your BIOS) For anyone in a similar situation here is what I did on my ROG Maximus Hero IX motherboard1: Wired pump to cpu header and USB 2.0 to header on mobo.2: Set CPU Fan to DC power / manual mode / %100 speed (so the pump runs at 100%)3: Wired radiator fans to PWM mobo headers (luckily the ROG Maximus Hero IX has plenty)4: Configured radiator fan profiles in Q-Fan (Asus bios based fan control)BOOM!! works great and I dont sacrifice RGB control either due to the fact that lighting changes are stored on the pumps on-board memory.

The customizable RGB LED ""infinity mirror"" is great, and I appreciate the ability to turn off the logo light."," I attempted to use this in my Min-ITX build, using a high end ITX board (Impact VIII). Two MAJOR issues:1) at least on this board, and most likely many other ITX boards, the tubing sticks out far enough from the pump base that it blocks the first RAM slot unless you are using very low profile RAM (Corsair LPX was the ONLY valid option for me).2) as if the RAM compatibility issue wasn't bad enough, the pump's HEIGHT (height from motherboard to top of the pump itself) is huge, and BLOCKS my ability to install a 120mm radiator from my GPU in exhaust-setup at the back of my case."," I really wanted to be able to use this AIO, but not enough to make as many compromises as would be necessary. Especially considering one of the entire points of an AIO is to offer a flexible cooling option that keeps the board area free of obstructions that an air cooler normally comes with. Ultimately I realized that I could get a Noctua U12S, and it would cool almost as well (within about 10-15 degrees), but cost less, be quieter, allow me to use whatever RAM I wanted, and provide enough room for my Hybrid GPU to exhaust out the back of the case...the solution was pretty clear.

The color combos are sweet, the settings for the lighting are great. They make my case really pop even more. You can even turn them off, although I have no idea why one would do that. Why pay a premium for a niche product and then proceed to not use said niche? Ya'll dumb if you're doin' that.The fans, even going full blast, aren't too loud. They're good quality, move plenty of air."," The instructions are written in a billion languages, they aren't the most useful, the components (ie screws) should have all been more clearly labeled.

This is where the boys get separated from the men, even in NZXT cases. I managed, but I know at some point I'll be re-cabling it... because it's hard to make pretty, just like my mom said about me.I didn't do my research on the 280 radiators. That's my own stupid fault. I still comfortably fit this in my case. That said, I HIGHLY doubt that people will have the ease of installation I had with my radiator. Make sure that you do your research to see if this will fit in your case, and if it doesn't, go smaller.

So, I took it off, cleaned off all of the stock thermal compound and put some ANTEC on and now I'm in the 50s while playing CS GO in 2K, which to me is acceptable.-Compared to other AIOs, this one has more wires coming off of it.  So more cables to manage, but you can't beat that infinity mirror look.-Does not run as cool as some other AIOs.  As far as performance goes, its in the middle for me.  My Corsair 280mm AIO (forget the model number off the top of my head H110 or something like that)  averaged about 2 or 3 degrees cooler than the Kraken.  Keep in mind though, it still works very well.  It's going to work better than air coolers for sure."," -I do recommend this AIO because although it doesn't perform as well as my old Corsair, the looks are impressive enough to not care about 2 or 3 degrees.  -CAM software is not as faulty as it used to be (even with windows 10) so don't listen to the older reviews.  My PC runs it just fine and if you install it properly and know what your doing, your PC will as well.-My Corsair did run cooler, but the LINK software from Corsair crashed a lot (doesn't work well with windows 10) so keep that in mind if you are comparing this with a corsair cooler.  They both need their software to run any customized setting and lately CAM is more reliable than LINK.  I'd go with NZXT over Corsair at this point in time.-Now, as I stated, I usually am overclocked about 28% and I play in 4K, that's a little extreme for most at this point in time so just for this review, I scaled everything down and I played CS GO in 1080p for an hour and my CPU temp was 43C at the highest with the KRAKEN.  I definitely recommend this, especially because the CAM software is working well now.-Get new thermal compound.  You will honestly think it is broken if you use what they give you.  It literally does not work.  Maybe I got one with bad paste on it, but just do yourself a favor and buy some quality thermal compound.",4,4

Easy RGB customization in the CAM software.", There is only a few problems. 1) It is a bit louder then a basic cpu cooler such as the Cooler Master hyper 212 evo. But you can change the fan settings in the CAM software. 2) There is a lot of cords to plug in. If you are trying to put this into a smaller case and still look good it may be hard. Make sure u have a spare USB plug available on your motherboard. 3) CAM the software is a little buggy.," This is a very nice add on to make your computer stand out.

The software looks nice and lets you customize the fan curve and color affects."," It seems like the product is more dependent on the software than I would have liked...

My AMD 6200 is running in the upper 20's at idle and upper 30's to low 40's in most games so far. In a 15 minute Prime95 stress test it stayed extremely quite while keeping a constant temp of 50°c. Concluding that the cooler works very well and looks very good too.A side note being more of a hard ware configuration problem or potential problem is that the tubes exit to the side about a half inch then turn 90° since this is on a MSI 970a-g46 motherboard, the RAM slots are rather close to the cpu socket. I managed to overcome this since 2 out of the 4 stick of ram are half lowprofile and just barely clear the tubes.

N82E16835146056,35-146-056,12/28/2016 9:02:17 AM,Anonymous,Love it,5," Obviously the look, it's a very pleasing and innovative looking product. I bought this to improve temps to facilitate overclocking. Dramatic improvement in temps over hyper 212 air cooler. I went from 80c under load in prime 95 to high 50's low 60's with the pump at 70% and fans at 50% (performance mode on pump and fans). My idle temps are 16-18c. Just barely over ambient. The thing is absolutely silent in a fractal r-5 case. I cannot hear it at all stress testing the CPU. It's a marked improvement over the old 120mm fan on the air cooler which was ridiculously loud at full speed. The two stock 140mm fans on the kraken at full load can definetly be heard but are more flat and less offensive than the one 120mm at full speed. Which is largely irrelevant since it doesn't need to run anywhere near full speed to adequately cool. I should mention that my voltage on my CPU is at 1.248 currently so it's beyond ""stock"" and still getting those lower temps. I ran a test run for about 10 minutes at 1.38 volts and the temps jumped up to the high 60's. More than adequate for a healthy CPU overclock. I never run the ""stock"" thermal paste on anything I always clean the stock paste and put on prolimatech pk-3. I wonder if some of the other reviewers might benefit from a paste swap because my cooler performs amazingly well. I've got quite a bit of experience installing components such as these so the install to me felt very straight forward and simple. The instructions were adequate and afforded no problems. All the parts were present and accounted for and fit as intended. The rad fit in my case no problem, the backplat me and bracket went in without problems. Power leads on fans are flexible and nice and long to wiring them couldn't be more straight forward. I do with the any manufacturer would supply longer cables such as the USB cable. I had to run the cable in a way I don't prefer due to length and the only open USB header being on the bottom of my board. I'm a bit of a cable management stickler and it is on the back of the case Unseen and really doesn't matter in all reality. The ports for fan and USB hookup are in an intuitive place, on top so exposed cable can be kept to a minimum and run neatly. I'm not a huge fan of running too many third party apps such a cam but the app performs as described and doesn't need to be open or running for the unit to retain its settings and operate properly. So it can be used to setup then left off. It's a decent monitoring utility, although the UI color scheme is not very contrasting and weird to me so it's hard to read at a glance. I wouldn't use it for that purpose. I really like everything about this unit and can't be more pleased with it.", Not one.,,9,10

With detailed and easy to understand pictures, the instructions are easy to follow.  The included mounting hardware can support a wide array of AMD and Intel sockets.  The mounting solution feels solid.  The radiator will exhaust all of the heat out of the computer case.  Air cooling HSF units exhaust the heated air into the case.  Although it is not included, you can add a second fan to the radiator so you have a push pull configuration to move more air.  The Captain 120 EX does a good job of keeping the CPU cool.  The pump and fan are quite.  The fan did get louder as it sped up under load.  The other fans in my case are quiet and the 120EX did not standout as being any louder than them.  The 120 EX just blended in.", The parts bags were labeled for AMD or Intel.  I needed to use parts from both bags to mount the 120EX cooler to an AMD motherboard.  A little confusing but I was able to sort out the pieces by looking at the detailed install instructions.," Some cooling solutions are difficult to install because of their size.  Some of the popular heat pipe units are taller than many cases will allow.  Other solutions do not fit because they interfere with heat spreaders on the RAM modules.  The 120EX fits inside the mounting bracket area.  I compared the shape of the 120EX to 7 different motherboards I have and it would fit every one of them.   It took me about 15 minutes to remove my motherboard, attach the 120EX bracket and reinstall the motherboard.  Another 10 minutes to install the cpu cooler onto the motherboard, mount the fan on the radiator and then mount the radiator to my case.   In less than 30 minutes I was able to start pushing my overclock to see how the 120EX would perform.   The Captain120EX did not disappoint in the results category.  I tested on a couple of different AMD and Intel systems.  I used stock speeds and went from a mild overclock to pushing 5 GHz.  The 120EX kept the cpu core temps at least 20 degress cooler than the stock HSF and a couple of degrees cooler than the aftermarket copper heat pipe coolers I compared it with.   That being said, the 120EX is not the answer for every overclocking setup.  I would definitely look at a solution with a larger radiator and multiple fans if you are looking at squeezing the most out of your overclock.  Even if it performed the same as the heat pipe solutions, the added plus of exhausting the heated air outside of the case dropped the temperature inside the case.  That helps keep the other components cool.  For looks, the Captain 120EX is available in black or white.  The black with red highlights blended in to my case color scheme nicely.  The water block has a light that softly pulses.  The light is subtle and actually looks nice.  The pulsing red light does remind me of eye of a certain sinister computer.",None,None

Let me start by saying I am a casual overclocker. I like to tinker, and squeeze as much performance out of my PC as possible, but without going to extremes. I generally don't like to push voltages much higher than stock, or tweak for hours on end, but I will go for the quick/easy overclock every time.When I bought my 6700k, I first tried overclocking with the stock Intel cooler, but that obviously did not go well. Even with a slight bump in voltage, temperatures climbed quickly. Gaming pushed them into the danger-zone, so I needed a new solution. Enter then CAPTAIN 120EX.I've always been a big fan of all-in-one coolers, mostly because they tend to offer the best cooling to noise ratio, and because I'm too much of a weenie to risk a real watercooling setup! When I found the CAPTAIN 120EX, I loved the look, and a quick glance over the reviews told me it was exactly what I wanted. When it arrived, it actually looked better than expected, but needed more LEDs - doesn't EVERYTHING? - so I added some! Installation was easy - even for beginners - and took maybe 30 minutes. Don't forget your favorite flavor of thermal paste! I tried with dual fans in a push-pull setup where the exhaust exited the case, and again with the fans pulling outside air into the case. In my situation, pulling outside air across the radiator gave better results.Here is a brief rundown of the temperature dropsGaming (cpu under load) 17C drop - yep dropped load temps by a full 17 degreesIdle temperature dropped a full 20 degreesTorture test (cpu at full load for 1 hour) - 15 degree dropI can't guarantee the same results for everyone, but they should be close! The DEEPCOOL Captain 120EX is exactly what I wanted, and it delivers a great look, and more importantly, excellent cooling while remaining very quiet.",1,1
N82E16835856077,35-856-077,1/21/2017 3:35:03 PM,Jason W.,Great small AIO liquid cooler,4," There is a lot to like about this little all-in-one liquid cooler.  The overall build quality is fantastic.  The power wires are braided and the pump hoses are as well. The included 120mm fan has a PWM connector and can move quite a bit of air. It also feels very well built. The clear tubing on the pump/cooler looks really cool and the breathing red LED light on the block is nice. It seems to breathe more often and brighter as it ramps up if you leave the pump at a variable speed.The instructions are simple to follow, though a few words would have been helpful. However, I had no issues getting this installed with little hassle. The mounting system is very well made and secures the cooling block with a metal bracket. Figuring out the orientation of the block and hoses takes a little planning, but the mount allows for the block to be installed in all 4 positions, which is very helpful."," The only thing I can complain about with this cooler is that it doesn't perform quite as well as I'd hoped. My 10 year old air cooler edged out this AIO liquid cooler.  See my comments below for more details.  However, I think unless you are limited by space I would spring for the 2 fan version for a little extra money. I feel it would remove this complaint and provide the additional cooling I was expecting."," Over all, this cooler definitely has a ""cool"" factor. It looks great in my RED LED themed case.  It's clean looking and relatively easy to install.  It just doesn't perform quite where I would like.  I think I'll look into a 2 fan liquid cooler if I ever replace my trusty Thermalright. I will say it held my overclock without issue, despite the slightly higher temps. It would also do VERY well in a small case where the radiator can be mounted as a rear exhaust.I tested this cooler against my trusty old Thermalright U-120 eXtreme air cooler that I've had for many years.

I still recommend checking to be sure, no matter how common your chip/socket setup is. And if it feels like it doesn't fit, I hope I don't need to tell you, but don't force it. Don't be that guy.Relatively easy install. Parts organized, everything in the box is ready to go, quite easy. Instructions leave a little something to be desired, but not enough to knock ease-of-assembly off the ""pros"" list here. Your experience may vary (see ""cons"" for more). If you really can't figure it out or just want to be sure you're doing everything right, check youtube.Aesthetically pleasing (assuming you like the colors / theme). The ""heartbeat"" red LED is a bit clever, might or might not match your aesthetic. I think for all possible choices Deepcool could have made for the theme, it should be at least tolerable for most people. I don't care for LEDs or flashy stuff at all, but it's not intrusive or showy enough for me to care. I guess if you have an all-green or all-blue LED thing going on, this might clash. If you're at that level of color coordination, I don't even know what to tell you.Tubing is pretty flexible and pliant. Seems like it should be good wherever you need it. Of course, if you think you'll want the radiator located in some unconventional spot, you better double check. Then again, what are you even doing? This is an entry-level item, if you're looking for a custom build with a complex cooling setup, you want more than the entry-level all-in-one product here.Radiator seems to work well (see below for actual figures). It looks like it's a good radiator. Obviously, a visual inspection will not actually provide any clue as to the thermodynamic effectiveness of a jumble of metal parts, but it certainly looks good. Totally pristine out of the box.Silent fan pushes air pretty well, not sure the specially designed blades do as much as they might assert but they work. The quiet part is less important to me since none of my other fans are particularly silent.It's not actually very expensive (despite one or two people saying so). For a top-notch fan/heatsink system, you would pay a bit less maybe, but these components are really coming down and making themselves easily affordable for the performance they offer. More on this in the ""other"" section.I only have a stock Intel fan for comparison of fans, and I also have a Corsair Hydro H50, which is an older product, but in the same category as this one (one fan, all in one, entry level). I'll run an idle test (boot, log in, wait), a moderate test (playing a game, watching a video, running a few programs in the background, auto-refreshing a few big, scripty websites every 10 seconds), and an intensive test (full load on all CPUs running some mathematical tasks indefinitely). Note that I have a Geforce Titan, so my GPU actually gets hit pretty hard running games at 4x actual resolution and downscaling. I figured it would be fair to still do that for the test, and the results seem to show it. All temps listed are both the approximate ""level"" temperature that the CPU warmed up to while the tasks were going on and also the max as far as I knew (i.e. no spiking while coming up to level or once level). I have an older i7 and it's not over-clocked, so my temps may be less than what others are hitting with higher clock speeds and slightly newer processors.120EX:Idle: 31CModerate: 39CHeavy: 51CCorsair Hydro:Idle: 33CModerate: 41CHeavy: 53CStock Intel Fan:Idle: 36CModerate: 54C*Heavy: 65C***This is probably because the air in the case is being toasted by the GPU. Important to consider, since liquid cooling might allow you to avoid the synergistic heating if your CPU and GPU are both working.**Pretty close to Intel's max temp spec for Ivy Bridge. With the stock fan, what did I expect? I bet leaving it longer, it would have climbed up even more, maybe hitting 67-69, but I'm a ""play it safe"" guy. I know it could probably survive up to 80C with virtually no chance of damage, but isn't the point of having good cooling to not risk it?"," Not entirely tool-less, depending on your set-up. For some of you, especially if you can't access the rear side of your motherboard while i'ts still in the case, you may need to take the motherboard out (which is probably not tool-less). Access to the back side of the board through your case is very helpful here. I don't think tool-less-ness is that important, so I'm going to say this isn't worth knocking off any eggs. We all know how to use a screwdriver, right?Some users do report quality / longevity issues (see ""other"" for more on this). This always concerns me. We do, fortunately, live in the age when a system will power down before the CPU fries itself (if everything else goes according to plan, at least). But this is a critical cooling component.In the end, I can't fully recommend a product of this type (cooling, essential) without knowing about its longevity. I have concerns about pump failure, as many have reported, and at the time of this writing, I really have no information to reassure me that this is something I could rely on without some concern. The 3-year warranty is nice, but replacing the cooler won't help if my CPU is fried. I know that's unlikely too, even in the event of a cooler going down, but like I've said, I'm a ""play it safe"" guy. I guess that might make me picky."," First, let's be clear about expectations: This is an entry-level product. It won't have the bells and whistles (selectable color theme, fancy software, profile creating, etc.). It has the 4-pin connector, so use your motherboard or some other control if you think you need that. This is a very competitive price, and with more diversity and improved products, we should see entry-level liquid cooling products continue to improve in quality and reliability. The price will continue to come down because, frankly, there isn't much besides engineering and time-tested quality that separates liquid cooling tech from fan-and-heatsink.As I mentioned above, I can't comment on the longevity of this item. As a Newegg EggXpert reviewer, I have to write my review 30 days after I receive the item. I didn't use it for the entire 30 days, but when I got it running, I kept it in until today. That was 23 days, give or take a few hours. I'm glad my unit works well, but I can't say that this gives me enough experience to comment in any way on the longevity of the product. I have mentioned that I surveyed other users' reviews after writing up most of mine, adding some comments about what I've seen there. Make sure you look at all reviews of all products to get a good idea of what products are reliable. EggXperts can't comment directly on how long anything lasts (beyond 30 days, anyway).The unit comes with thermal paste, but I always recommend going for the extra $5 tube of high-quality, name-brand paste. It's like if you bought a computer and it came with ""Generic Best Antivirus Software Bundle Pack Extreme Demo Version!"" I'd say you're better off with a better software package, even if the computer is fantastic, right? (Note: You'll also need a couple paper towels and some rubbing alcohol to clean the existing pre-applied paste of the cooler -- and presumably, whatever's currently on your CPU if it's not a new build.)The left/right vs. 4-corner methods of attachment debate I will leave open. Does it really matter? Is one superior? I think there are way more variables out there than just this. If you really prefer one or the other, choose accordingly, but I can't say this item is better or worse for being designed the way it is.Some of these parts are plastic. Some people dislike plastic generically, as a sign of inferior quality. In other cases, plastic is lighter or cheaper, and that might be good. I don't see anything here where plastic makes me seriously question the quality of the product. It's metal where it counts, and the plastic seems strong enough where it's plastic.This is one of a diverse line of CPU coolers. To see a more complete picture of the performance and reliability of these units, you can uncheck the box for ""Item Specific Reviews."" You'll see more reviews for other items in this line, which might have similar performance, quality, longevity, etc. Some of the products in this line will provide better cooling for more intense use or overclocked CPUs.And final thought wow, Deepcool, they really love using ridiculous phrases to describe their products. ""Steam Punk""? ""Upgraded anti-explosion rubber""? Read the blurb, it's pretty self-assured. It's not a bad product, so they should feel proud of it, but they do sound a bit silly.",None,None

This is an entry level AIO liquid cooler and expectations have been adjusted accordingly.  With that said, I must say it is definitely one of the best looking AIO liquid coolers out there. The pulsing reactor water block with the glass tube showing coolant flow makes this AIO really stand out. While running, the pump is definitely audible as a purr but is not overly annoying. Fan noise is also acceptable.  This is a small water cooler, even among the field of 120 mm radiator liquid coolers.  Take notice of how slim the radiator is compared to other 120 mm offerings and you'll see what I mean."," For comparison, with my current setup I've been running a tower HDT cooler with push-pull 120 mm fans. It's more bulky than this all-in-one, but it's also about the same price. In my setup, the DEEPCOOL Gamers Storm Captain 120EX gets about 3 °C warmer on each core of my 4700k at load. This is with the radiator and fan mounted at the front of my case drawing in cool air and using the same thermal paste.In short, for the money you can get as low, or lower, temps using a good quality air cooler.", So I have this AIO liquid cooler and a better performing air cooler. Which one am I using right now?  I'm sticking with the DEEPCOOL Gamer Storm Captain 120EX. It has one less fan than my tower cooler and even with the purr from the pump it is quieter. The loss in cooling performance is not an issue for me since temperatures are still more than acceptable. The coolness factor of this AIO is enough to push it over the edge for me.,None,None

Having said that, I have brought the CPU to 4.5Ghz and the temps are still well within the limits, but add 3 Deg. C to the numbers.If you want to max out your CPU overclocking, then go for at least a 240mm version of a cooler but do your research!

The glass tubing piece is a nice touch.Installation was actually tool-less like DEEPCOOL claims (at least for an AM3+ socket).  Instructions for the installation were straightforward and easy to understand.The unit has enough tubing to the radiator to mount either in the top or the back of most cases.  Even in my very large case, I didn’t have too much trouble reaching.Along that same line, the tubes are covered with a sleeving that seems to do a very good job of eliminating kinking.  Also, the pump has nice fittings that swivel a bit allowing for a little extra maneuverability when situating the radiator.Waterblock and pump combination is a decently compact design which has plenty of clearance when installed on the AMD motherboards I tried.  Pump is very quiet in normal operation after an initial “burping” of air bubbles.  With respect to temperatures, this unit managed to keep my AMD Phenom II x4 955 BE (OC’d to 4.0 GHz) at around 45C when loaded up and around 37C at idle.  This being in a room where the ambient temp is currently at 21.1C.  I used Prime 95 running for 5 hours as a test here.The biggest difference between this and my gigantic double fan air cooler was the return to idle temp.  This returned about 5 seconds quicker than with my traditional air cooler (120mm, 8 heatpipe, dual fan design) that I used for comparison."," Tubing is a bit stiff and hard to work with at room temp when initially mounting the radiator.The hardware provided wasn’t really labeled very well and some pieces for the AMD setup were in the wrong bag.  That being said, I’m a smart boy and figured it out.As silly as it sounds, I wish I could change the “pulsing” LED on the pump to just stay on (as an option)"," I’m giving this unit good marks, but my last one died after 6 months of continuous use.  We’ll see if this one is any better.Overall, I don’t know whether the “dual blade” design on the fan makes a difference with CFM, but the fan is very quiet under even heavy load.Overall, I felt like I really had to nit pick to find something wrong with this unit.  It does what it should and stays quiet.",None,None
N82E16835856077,35-856-077,12/11/2016 1:22:35 PM,Kyle K.,Great competition for other major brands - Would recommend,5," The same as my previous two Deepcool coolers, all the components are separated based on socket, and labeled numerically so that they’re easy to find and can be referenced in the installation instructions.I have used a DeepCool  AIO (All In One) liquid cooler before, almost a year ago. In one year, they've certainly made some improvements in quality. A year ago I said it was a well made AIO cooler, since then, they have made noticeable improvements to the fan included with the cooler, and the tubing. The fans have received built in sound damping, more blades, and just generally, better build quality, and the tubing has been switched to a much more flexible material. The previous point is actually a huge improvement, as it totally knocks one of my cons off the list from the model I received previously.The pump still looks awesome.BENCHMARKS 1These benchmarks were obtained using Real Temp.

The radiator and heat sink had no additional cushioning besides their semi form fitting cardboard carton.Unlike the previous model I tested which came with a four way fan power splitter, this model does not come with any sort of splitter. If you want to do a push/pull configuration with this cooler then, you're going to be using your own splitter, fan controller, or multiple molex connectors.I guess this can go under cons, some people will certainly see it as such; the mounting bracket that sits on the back of your MOBO is now plastic. My previous model used a metal bracket. Improved is that the long screws which go through the bracket and through your MOBO now sit very snuggly in the bracket. Not so good, is that it's plastic now. It's not flimsy or anything, just would have preffered metal.Benchmarks 2These benchmarks were obtained using Real Temp and Prime95. Each test was run for 15 minutes. Data points were taken every 15 seconds and then averaged. Clock speeds are reported in MHz, CPU temperatures are reported in Celsius and CPU load is reported as a percentage.

This new one runs ice cold compared to the old. Even the more realistic ""real world"" benchmarks point to a slight gain for the new cooler.Installation is time around was simpler (due to additional experience) but still did not go at all as the instructions illustrated. I have the radiator sitting outside on top of my case with one of my own case fans pulling through, and the included fan pushing through from the inside of my case. The more flexible tubing made installation simpler this time around, but there was still a decent amount of fiddling with the orientation of the whole package.A sub point to the above, more of a word of caution actually: be wary of how much space you have inside your case. Realistically, you’ll want about two inches of open space for the radiator and fans wherever you decide to mount them.I’ll save you the research: This cooler has an average warranty. I’ve seen similar coolers with warranties as low as a year, and as high as six. This one has a three year warranty.Came with thermal paste this time around, but, meh, don't skimp, use stuff of a known quantity and quality.Overall, I'd say this cooler is a very welcome improvements from DeepCool's older models. Installation has been made slightly easier, quality has gone up, and temperatures have gone down. Same as my previous DeepCool AIO, it has been running great for the past month. I've not had to mess with it since I finished the installation. I would definitely recommend this cooler if you're in the market for an AIO liquid cooler.",1,1
N82E16835856077,35-856-077,12/11/2016 8:24:27 AM,Kevin D.,Works and Looks Great,5," The cooler definitely has a solid, quality feel when you take it out of the box. The fan is very solid and quiet. The heat “radiator” is heavy and well constructed. Obviously liquid cools much better than air, so this will keep your CPU as cool as a cucumber. The cooler comes with thermal grease already applied."," The instruction sheet is kind of small. I’m OK with language agnostic instructions, but it would really help if the diagrams were larger and easier to read. Having to remove the motherboard from the case was a bit of a hassle, but necessary because of the size and weight of the cooler."," As expected, the most complicated part of the install was dealing with the small parts that are customized for each supported CPU type. I am currently running an I7 2600 which uses an lga1155 socket. In my case, installation involved putting a back plate under the motherboard, feeding 4 long screws up from underneath, putting stand offs on the screws, and then putting the mounting brackets (two of them) onto the standoffs. The cooler itself attaches to the mounting brackets and tightens down. From there, it is just a matter of mounting the fan/radiator and connecting the power. Overall it took me about an hour to install, mainly because I had to remove the mother board to install the back plate.I live it a very hot climate, and in the summer, the inside of the house is over 80F degrees for about 7 straight months which makes CPU cooling a challenge. Because of this, having a liquid cooler is a very good option for me.I’ve had it installed for about a month and it is working great. Maximum CPU temperatures dropped over 20 degrees Celsius on average, and now rarely exceed 45 Celsius under full load. The LED light effect is a nice touch too.",None,None

This model has the upgraded mounting system with it but I'm not so sure I'd call it an upgrade. Call me old fashioned but I like the four corner method for better clamping force. Visually this thing is fun to look at while its running on your system. It pulsates a red led thru the tube that comes off the pumps center which also allows you to see the coolant flowing. I tested this puppy out on my 6700K build that I was having heat issues with on my custom loop to help me determine if my custom block was the issue or if I just had a hot cpu. with my custom loop running dual 360mm rads my temps spiked to 73c on the hottest core. I set the Captain 120Ex up to run alone on my cpu and saw only 70c on the hottest core both tests were ran using Asus's RealBench stress test. To say the least I was amazed at the performance differences. My cpu was run at 1.25vcore @4.3GHz yes overclocked but under volted as well as the stock vcore for my cpu showed to be 1.29 vcore prior to making bios changes. BTW I have since changed cpu blocks and I'm frosty. But thats another story. The tubing they use on these units is of good quality albeit a bit stiff but easily manageable to setup in any orientation.  They improved the fans static pressure with the EX models but I would of liked to see 2 fans included as most if not all 120mm rad systems benefit from the extra air flow., I'm going to call the mounting system a con do not get me wrong it works fine and is easy to install but having a system where you only tighten left/right is not as good as the four corner methods. And lastly lack of a second fan I'd call a con as well., Very nicely built unit that will keep your stock to mildly overclocked cpu from getting super hot during your fraggin sessions. 2 minor cons that really do not detract from the overall experience. Easy to install and sexy to look at while its running. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to replace a stock cooler any day,None,None

It fits very well in my mid tower case (I plan on upgrading soon to a full tower but just haven't been able to decide which one I like) though is still just as tight a fit as every other component.  I pulled an Intel brand AIO sealed liquid cooler in order to install this one.  I like the Intel because it has the Intel logo in blue LED and looks great with the blue lights in my case but I have been considering going with a different color scheme when I upgrade.  To that end I have decided to continue using this Deepcool.  Also I really don't want to have to gut my PC again.  I saw no significant temperature decrease or increase so this cooler functions just as well as one Intel chooses to put their logo on.  I would not be at all reluctant to use this cooler.  It really does look good and function well.Though the cooler is quite simple to install (look up videos on YouTube or other places online with a simple web search) the instructions included are pretty terrible.  Seriously (and this isn't a guy ""I don't stop to ask for directions"" kind of thing) just throw the instructions away.I am using this cooler with an Intel socket 2011v3.  I see there are already a lot of other reviews that talk about temperatures compared to CPU load so I won't bore anyone with those specific techie details.  Also I'm of the old school opinion that onboard motherboard temp sensors cannot be trusted (except as a way to determine that whatever cooler installed is actually working) and I'm not a big enough techie to have a separate one installed.  Maybe my next build I'll get one of those cool ones with the LED readout that mounts in one of the drive bays.", Honestly if you are looking for an all-in-one sealed liquid cooling solution then this is a great product with no cons whatsoever.  There aren't a lot of customization options for the extreme tech wizards but for your average geek who wants to be a step or three ahead of pre-built PCs in terms of appearance and function this is perfect., Though my wife didn't really see it to me it kind of looks like this cooler adds a bit of a steampunk vibe to the system.  This cooler may have just inspired the new look to my next build.  Now to just find or create a steampunk-ey type case.

N82E16835856077,35-856-077,11/22/2016 7:58:28 PM,Kenneth R.,Good Cooling Solution for FX8000 series,5," I installed this on an FX8350 replacing a DeepCool Neptwin air cooler.  The Neptwin does a fantastic job of keeping the FX8350 running cool, but it is huge.  With the Neptwin, I had to remove the cooler to do any type of upgrade or modification because it covered nearly everything.  It was also a real pain to remove and install.Now the CAPTAIN 120EX was a different story.  Easy to install and leaves plenty of room for working inside the case.  In fact, this was the only liquid cooler that I have been able to install in the Corsair Carbide SPEC-01 case.  The case is not particularly suited for liquid cooling and I had to settle for the Neptwin cooler until I found the CAPTAIN 120EX to fit the case.The CAPTAIN 120EX performs well with thermal margins well below the thermal limit for the FX8350.  The thermal margin during light use is 55c to 59c - that means the core temperature is well below the max.  During heavy loads and benchmarking, the thermal limit dropped to around 40c.  To put that in perspective, the core temperature is still 40c below the thermal max limit for the processor.  That is pretty impressive.  To give credit to the Neptwin, it performed on par with the CAPTAIN 120EX but you are talking about a massive sized air cooler with 6 copper heat pipes.The noise level is not even noticeable on the CAPTAIN 120EX.  This is a very quiet cooler and the only noise I hear is the case fans and the fan on the Radeon graphics card.  The Neptwin was fairly quiet also until I put a load on the CPU and the fans cranked up.  On the other hand, I did not notice a difference in noise between idle and load on the CAPTAIN 120Ex.All and all, a very good cooler for FX8350 especially when space is a factor in the case.  None of the other liquid cooling I tried would fit in this case.", The only con I can think of is the cryptic installation instructions.  You have to figure it out yourself or look it up online.

It was actually quite easy when I looked at the parts and not the paper.," When installing, I made the mistake of installing the radiator and fan before the CPU block.

N82E16835856077,35-856-077,11/21/2016 6:18:20 AM,Justin B.,Worked great for me,5," Very cool looking with a relatively high end feel. Their website markets it as being ""Steampunk"" in appearance. I don't know about that, but it does look cool. If you have an enclosed case, you may not care as much, but if you have a window in your case, this will make you happy.Pretty quiet, which all liquid cooling systems should be. You'll be happy with the noise level.Tubing seems to be high quality. Their website notes it's ""upgraded anti-explosion rubber tube.""  Sounds like a plus to me!Supports all the major, modern CPU socket types.DEEPCOOL's website has a YouTube video walk-through as well as a PDF regarding installation. Very handy for people who have never installed one of these guys before.This is very easy to install, so if this is your first build with a liquid cooler, you shouldn't have any issues.Cooling performance was very good. My CPU never got over 105 f (40.5c) under full benchmarking load."," More plastic than I'd prefer, but for the price I suppose that's what you get. Just be careful with installation as you don't want to push too hard on those plastic pieces lest you hear the snap crackle pop that will ruin your day.Can't configure the push/pull of your fans. Not a huge deal, but not good if you prefer advanced customization.It's a tad bit big, so if you have a really small or cramped case you may have a hard time getting this in there and situated correctly."," Be aware of possible reliability issues as noted below. I also had an issue with a previous (not this unit) DEEPCOOL liquid cooling system (the fan died), and will note the support for that was very easy. An email to the company and a new fan was on its way. Support is Chinese-based.",1,1
N82E16835856077,35-856-077,11/20/2016 7:29:59 PM,Kenith H.,H20 Simplified,5," A cheaper all in one solution simplified for water cooling. I like the braided cloth coating on the tubes much better than the cheap looking bendy straw covering over the previous model. The glass pipe connections look so much more cleaner and smoother than the previous model as well. The EX version looks to have put in some effort into making it look like a more professional build. It did drop my temps by 20 to 30 degrees. I like the light during setup as it shows you it Is working, but once I put my cover on, I don’t see it anymore. It was packaged rather well in my opinion. It looked like a showroom model! No dents, no dings, or anything negative to report."," Extra component (The Pump) to worry about.Due to the AIO setup, you are restricted to mounting this on the inside of a case. I didn’t dare to unscrew or try to disconnect any of the hoses to “try and get it outside my case” because I didn’t want to make a mess or break any seal that could cause a leak in my system. The whole part of AIO is so you wouldn’t have to do such. The fan now, you can choose to place on the outside pulling air in, outside pulling air off or inside pushing air over or off. Pulling air off the rad and throwing into the case doesn’t sound very efficient to me! My biggest problem with this is; the length of the tubes, restricts you to the back of the case. No matter how I place the fan, I’m not really going to get cold air blowing over the rad which would be ideal for optimal performance. But with as much heat as the other components inside the case put off, you certainly don’t want to pull that warm air over the rad. You really should plan your whole cooling solution for your setup. I like to put fans at the front pulling cool air into the case over the HDD and other components and the fans in the back pushing all the warm air out. My HTPC case setup doesn’t have front fans, but side… So, it pulls in the cool air from the sides and pushes it out the back. So all that warm air happens to be pushed right toward that fan coving the rad which has its warm water running through it. If I was interested in keeping this unit in my PC, I might put a fan on the outside to “pull” air away from the rad. (I assume you could just put the fan screws through the fan first and then it would grab the back side of the rad pulling it tight to the case?)It is certainly an AIO as it includes the thermal tape on the bottom of the heatsink. I would prefer to use artic silver, but I wasn’t sure I would want to keep this in my HTPC.  "," I would highly recommend treating the braided cloth over the tubes each time you blow out your PC assuming you do that a few times a year. (Good time to do it is when you change the filters in your furnace.) I am going to use vegetable glycerin since I have an abundance of it around, but I reckon WD40 would keep it from drying up and getting brittle just the same.If you are going through the whole process of trying to get your CPU cooler, why would you cut corners at the end? With this single fan rad, I would not put in any extra effort. Slap it against the case, throw the fan on and be done. I don’t do any overclocking though so it is fine for me. If you really want to cool your processor down, I would highly recommend the dual fan setup though! A custom-built setup would probably work better because if you can place the rad somewhere on the outside of the case where it can pull cool air and push the warm air away, that would be the best setup for getting the best cooling. Between the learning and cost, an all in one setup like this is just so much easier. Providing the pump doesn’t go out like others have mentioned. Build your own, you can replace the parts on your own. Don’t want the mess, drama, crash course on connectors, elbows, tubing and liquid to use? Water cooling doesn’t excite me much anymore, but this setup at least looks really nice and doesn’t perform too bad. Still, the extra part (Pump) to worry about failure just doesn’t set well with me or the thought of a punctured tube leaking liquid in the PC. I plan on taking it off during our Thanksgiving break and going back to air cooling. The drop in temp was nice and all, but not worth the gamble to me. That and the extra heat will help during the winter months! Now, while I personally won’t use it, I don’t see the point in knocking off an egg just because I am not comfortable with the thought of it springing a leak. For what it is and how it performs, it is fantastic! Certainly, a whole lot easier to deal with than my first water cooling setup which I bought the parts individually and spent a small fortune on! From special quick connectors to custom chipset blocks. (I sold that setup over a decade ago!) Haven’t really had any desire for water cooling since, but I surely wouldn’t turn down an opportunity to give it a go! I did, and I wasn’t to impressed… If I had a CPU that kept overheating and none of the air solutions worked, then I might be more impressed with this product!",None,None
N82E16835856077,35-856-077,11/17/2016 11:33:57 AM,Matthew J.,Par for the course performance with a little bit of style,4, - Quiet pump and fan- Premium feeling fan- Manageable tubing between pump and radiator- Unique aesthetic and an included case badge, - No LED control- Mounting hardware for only a single fan configuration," Let's start with quality. The fan seems to be good quality; it has a nice weight to it, vibration dampening corners, and quiet operation. The radiator is on-par with other similar coolers as is the tubing. The pump / block is quiet and easy to mount, but the plastic shrouds that give it the special look are a bit looser than I would have liked. It would have been nice to have control over the LED lighting, but the subtle breathing effect and overall brightness and color will work well with most builds.In terms of installation, everything, again, is pretty standard. The plastic CPU backplate isn't amazing, but it is functional and that is what matters. The aluminum rails that go on the front of the motherboard make installing the pump / block easy - no juggling act to perform on both sides of the motherboard. But, where this cooler pulls ahead in the pump / block mounting, it falls behind when it comes to the radiator and fan. The included hardware only allows for mounting the fan in a push configuration, and the holes for the hardware in the radiator were not well threaded. I had to run a screw through each hole to chase the threads before attempting to mount the unit.Moving to performance, this unit performs just about the same as every other liquid cooler AIO that I have tested. However, this one did come in a little bit quieter than some of the competition. One thing that I noticed that may impact performance in certain instances and computer cases is that there is a notable amount of back-air. Even with the fan at half speed, there was still a decent amount of air coming back out the front of the fan that didn't make it through the radiator. While this won't affect cooling performance for the CPU, it may impact airflow through the computer case.Overall, this DEEPCOOL AIO offers performance to rival its competitors, but adds a bit of a different aesthetic for a small premium. If you are looking for a cooler that offers that intriguing aesthetic with a nice red glow to be seen through a side-panel window, this may be the cooler for you.",None,None

The liquid cooler itself looks and feels very nice. The pump unit has a nice design and with the visible liquid tube as well as breathing red led light around the inside. This not only shows you that the pump is functioning and that the system has power and water is flowing. I never found the visible function from other brands. The pump has the two tubes for the water to flow through. They can be adjusted slightly to help with managing the tubes around your case, especially if it is a smaller case. The mounting system is very clever. The mounting plate attaches to the back of the CPU and then it screws into the front. The screws have springs attached to stop them being over tightened which may cause damage to the watercooler and damage to the CPU socket.The radiator has mounting holes for one 120mm PWM fan, high-quality rubber pad for mounting, keep quiet, nice red rubber to match red glass pump.All mounting hardware is included for the fan as well as for mounting the radiator to the pc case. BE AWARE if your case is quite small or compact then the radiator and fan may not fit as the power connectors for the motherboard and if you have RAM with heatsinks installed this may stop you from installing the fan well.With my Intel Core i5 2500k overclocked to 4.5GHz at full load the CPU reaches around 60 degrees and at idle it usually sits between 30 - 40 degrees.This is far better than the stock intel cooler as at idle it used to sit anywhere between 30-45 degrees and under load it used to reach around 85 degrees.The included fan are extremely quiet, the noise of my other fans in my case far overpower the noise of these. The fans hardly add any noise but if they ramp up they can become slightly louder.The pre applied thermal paste seems to do a good job and as it is there already in a thin layer this means beginners don't have to learn to apply paste correctly and it saves you a lot of hassle.Overall this CPU cooler is great for either beginners or professionals who want to improve their cooling and temperature performance of their CPU. Due to the vast range of supported socket types and how easy and quick it was to install twinned with the affordability makes it an ideal purchase for anyone!", none at this moment," The installation guide that helps you to install the unit is relatively easy to understand. However I would have preferred to have two separate instruction guides, one for AMD and one for Intel as the instructions are mixed together and can be confusing and you may end up doing something that was unneeded.All in all, I highly recommend this product to everyone.",1,1

The pipe fittings wont take much stress, and if your CPU is about 6"" from the rear fan area it will stress the joints from having to flip the cooling block into position. I kinda feel that this assembly would be better served being a kit that you assemble the tubes for instead of an AOI. It looks really nice and fit her scheme very well, I really liked this cooler and wish it would have worked. The packaging is simple yet effective, could use a little more padding around the radiator though, had some bent fins. They have really improved the mounting hardware on this unit, all steel construction, might even be called overkill for the little cooling block :). Fan is a great design, seems like it would move a lot of air through the radiator without being a turbine. I am returning it to Newegg because we went out and bought a high-end air cooler and no longer need this unit. The experience turned her off of water coolers in general, but I still have hope.

I have heard of all of the good reviews for Corsair and NZXT AIOs, and I had also heard of the negative reviews surrounding the non EX version of this AIO. After ownership for about a month, I am completely satisfied with this AIOs performance. It looks great with my red MSI build, and even after sustained gaming, temps never go past 65c. My only complaint is that I should have gotten the EX 240 instead of the EX 120 :P Deepcool has done a fantastic job addressing the issues of the previous Captain AIO, and I would recommend this AIO for someone looking for water cooling that doesn't want a cliche Corsair cooler",1,1

I decided to go with this Deepcool AIO after looking at a lot of different 120mm AIOs because I have had positive experiences with Deepcool products in the past (mostly their case fans). I wasn't a huge fan of the aesthetics at first but it grew on me as I thought about how it would match my AsRock Fatal1ty z170 Gaming-ITX/AC motherboard's color scheme and ""gamery"" aesthetic. I was also limited a bit to radiators with thicknesses that would fit in a Silverstone FTZ01 and didn’t' want something that had the asetek design.Installation was a breeze. The mounting kit is easy to understand and creates a very solid mount on the CPU. Coming from a beQuiet! Shadow Rock LP, I was worried that the pump noise would be too loud but much to my surprise, even at full pump speed, this pump is virtually silent. The tubing is strong and robust but still flexible which allowed me to mount the radiator without any issues. The included fan is great and isn't too noisy at higher speeds and does a very good job at extracting heat from the radiator (I have mine in a push pull config with one slim 120mm fan and the included fan). When running AIDA64 Stability tests, temps stay around 55-60C with a i5-6600K overclocked to 4.2GHz. The only complaints I have are that the pump assembly is kind of large compared to other options on the market (the tubing is very close to pushing up against my RAM and I barely had enough clearance for the glass tube in my SFF case to the side panel) and the AIO (pump, fan and LEDs) cannot be controlled via software. I knew this was the case going into the purchase and these weren't large enough cons to deter me from purchasing this product. In the end, I am very satisfied with my purchase and can happily recommend DEEPCOOL's product to others.",3,3

The tubing has a sturdy cloth finish that doesn't kink easily. The red coolant and breathing LED add some great aesthetical value aswell.," Only thing I didn't like is that you can't control the LED, it's always breathing when the system is on.

I wanted a liquid cooler that matched the aesthetic of my build, and this one seemed promising. It cooled for about two weeks before the pump died. I sent it back to Zalman, who RMA'd it for another one. Then the pump on that one died after a couple months. I sent it back to RMA it again, but they kept ignoring my emails, and when I'd call, they'd give every possible excuse for why it hadn't been sent back a month later - from ""we never got it"" to ""it went to the wrong department"". Finally they sent me a unit and it worked fine for about a year before the pump died once again. I then put a generic heatsink on my FX-8350 and haven't looked at liquid cooling since. Maybe I was extremely unlucky, or maybe Zalman doesn't know how to make a quality pump, or have quality customer service for that matter.

In the interest of a push pull configuration I would like to suggest that the buyer look at the specs of this cooler. If one would note that it has a low fan speed of 1000 rpm, with a secondary or middle speed of 1500; then of course a top speed of 2200 rpm you could surmise that an equal pull fan would be required for a balanced set up. I chose the Startech fan as my pull or exhaust fan.With all these whiners that hate noise O M G! You can't expect to do any overclocking with an unbalanced fan configuration IE any old exhaust case fan. Do your homework. And also look with your eye's while shopping.

I ran the AS rock auto OC and it set it at 4.3Ghz and under any load so far its been 40-50c So im very happy with that this is also with both fans at a constant 1100rpm. i then have a steep ram up after 63c (witch it hasnt hit yet) I have no idea if this is good performance I'm happy with it. way cooler than before and this thing looks awsome in my case.I hope zalmann reads this its a very cool (haha see what i did there) pice but id like to see to changes might even buy it again if they do. longer hoses or at least a long version, and i mean like 2x that long and a second fan with the blads reversed so it pulls. If they did that i would have put it in the front of my case behind one of the intake fans. As it is now its right above the 970. I said it runs 40-50, it only hits 50 after ive been gaming a while.

I bought the product from New Egg at a discounted price and figured I would try it.  No, I am not trying to push an extreme-edition LGA2011 to 5.0 with it, but it is doing exactly what a liquid CPU cooler is supposed to for the project I built.

This manifested as the computer turning on, the boot code on the mobo getting to FF and then the computer shutting off. I swapped out the mobo and the proc (FX-8320) and both did the same thing.

I have tried this with an FX-8350 and FX-9590 and was able to adequately cool them both.  Was able to run both chips clocked at 5ghz with idle temps averaging 35 degrees C.  Please read Cons for further temperature issues.," First we will start with temps.  With my fx-9590 at stock speeds and settings...I was not able to run Prime95 for more than 2 minutes before hitting temps of +80 degrees C....even after adding another 120mm fan for a push/pull configuration.  For making the claim of being able to effectively displace 400W of heat...I feel like I should be able to really push the 9590 at stock settings and not worry about temperatures one bit.This cooler is SO LOUD.  Hands down the loudest fan I have ever experienced in real life.  This one fan alone was louder than my four 140MM fans and 3 200mm fans all on high put together.  Even after tinkering with speeds in the BIOS the only way I was able to get the noise levels down was by applying a PWM resistor (the one that comes with the Zalman 9900MAX) fo the attached fan.Thermal Grease.  For spending more than $100 on a cooler...it should come with a decent quality thermal grease.  I was not happy with the performance of the cooler after initial installation so I removed the cooler and applied some Artic Silver that I had in the house and immediately saw a drop of about 8 degrees on average temps.Configuration Options.  For spending so much on this cooler...your only option is to bolt it in and that's it.  You can only install with the fans blowing in exhaust do to the fact that the 120mm fan is not removable.  Another thing I think this cooler is missing is hardware and software to be able to adjust fan settings to different temps/modes.Conclusion:  In reference to this cooler vs others on the market....you are getting no additional performance whatsoever for the extra money that you are spending.  To be honest...the cooler that came packaged with my 9590 works a little bit better than this one, has more configuration options, and is cheaper.What you are paying for ultimately is a cooler that looks different than the others out there....that's about it.",,3,7

They need a heavy duty version of the shroud that is on it now. This is where I dropped 1 egg from the rating.  It is flimsy as is.Color - They really need to offer at least Blue and Red versions of this cooler for builders going for certain looks. But not dropping an egg for this as it is aesthetics.Pump - If like me your tower sits on the desk right next to you the pump can be heard but just barley.  I'm not going to knock and egg when I have a Cooler Master HAF 922 sitting inches from my face and I can hear the pump, but if you are looking for a silent option this is not it. And you won't find much of one for a gaming rig."," When doing the install for this I would recommend having a friend to help, four hands made this an easy install.  Doing this by yourself could be difficult when mounting the pump.  I would recommend that you install the fan first hopefully this is common sense to most people.I would like to test a push/pull config to see how much further I could get the temps to drop and would be recommended for anyone doing some serious over clocking as you should get a better return.Even though I can hear the pump slightly it is a new noise to me and is not very loud at all, some reviews I have read complain non stop about this.  If you are looking for a silent case then good luck with a gaming rig this can be hard to do and pretty expensive with passive water cooler towers.  Again you shouldn't notice the pump sounds if your case sits under your desk or away from you.  Mine just happens to only have room mere inches from me.

Also, the radiator fan shroud is flexible, so MAKE SURE nothing touches it or the shroud will distort and the fan will rub against the shroud.  Deducted one egg for this overly delicate and finicky shroud."," Mounted this in the lower rear 120mm fan position of my Antec1200 case, per Antec recco.  The radiator hose fittings encroach into the top PCIE card slot, rendering that slot unusable.  Also, the top 120mm fan cannot be used.

FX-6300 with slight overclock never goes above 25C, with the ambient temp is around 65-70F."," Most of the same as said before. A couple of times it has made a weird whine/hissing noise. Tilting the entire machine on it's side seems to clear this up. Not sure if it was a flow problem or what. Because of this, tried mounting the reserator with the tubing on the bottom, but my case doesn't allow that. (Those of you with a regular tower case won't have issues here. My HAF XB lays flat so the I/O panel blocks the tubes if I try to adjust it's angle.)"," After enabling 'Silent' mode for the fan in my UEFI, it's extremely quite. Around 1800+ RPM is where it starts to become noticeable, but on 'Silent' mode it's hovering around 1500-1700 RPM. It's just barely louder than my Cougar CF-V14HPs. The shrouding I mentioned in my last review (or lack of) does seem to do what it's supposed to do. With noise no longer an issue, having the ability to cool nearby hardware is a cool bonus.

Working on par with my CM Hyper 212 Evo so far. Fits a 120mm exhaust. Lighted elements are a soft glow & not overpowering. Mounting is fairly simple. Hardware seems up to the task, no flimsy parts so far. Pump can run off a regular case-fan port, the fan is PWM running off the CPU-fan port."," Fan PWM cable could be longer. Fan is a little on the noisy side. Tubing is a little stiff & the length inhibits certain mounting directions. IMO, it could really use a shroud on the exhaust fan. (See comments for details.)"," Ok, so far after a couple hours of gaming, my FX-6300 @ 3.8Ghz is at 40C, according to HwInfo64. That's about what I was running previously with my Hyper 212 EVO. Mounting & installation is about the same as any aftermarket cooler - just with tubing management & mounting the rad & fan. The fan started out whisper quite, but right now it's doing just over 2K RPM, according to HwInfo. It does produce noticeable noise & is the loudest component in my case. But if you don't have PWM fans installed already, it'd probably be on-par with standard case fans. I haven't tested a push/pull config yet but I think it might be a good idea. As the fan isn't shrouded, the is a noticeable draft of air blowing out sideways from the first coil loop closest to the fan. (Gonna test this later to see if it really circulates air here to cool MB voltage regulators & chipsets like they hint at.) On the back of the case, I can't feel any exhaust air - not to say there isn't any, but I can't feel it behind my current setup. Also, I attribute the noise to the lack of shrouding. Just wrapping your hand around part of the radiator right behind the fan is enough to dampen much of the noise. So far it's working, but I'd put it at an entry level cooler. Will have to see how it does against overclocks & in a push/pull config. If you have just a stock cooler, this would be a nice way to upgrade if you want a little 'Wow' factor & have some extra cash.",4,5

If you mount it as a top mount the hoses are way to long and want to kink no matter how you twist and loop them......  If you mount it as a front mount the hoses fit perfectly...  And the fan plugs are way to short to reach the CPU fan headers...  Other then that running of the bios fan control it's almost silent at idle and general use on a I5 2500k clocked at 4.2Ghz keeping temps below 40C..... Under heavy gaming load fans kick up around 45C and the CPU doesn't see more then 46.... Very efficient.....Have not seen any cracking or leaking yet after a couple weeks that seems to get reported only time will tell......,None,None

I have a mild overclock on it to 4.2Ghz, and after 11 hours of Prime 95, the CPU temp was 80 degrees.  If you use the bundled fans, they come prewired together.  Price was good."," Had to add coolant once before.  Contacted Rainjintek support, and they said it was normal to add coolant.  However, I always have wondered where the coolant went.  Today, I was adding coolant for a second time, and I found out.  Water was leaking out at the base of the fittings on the water block.  That my GPU has a back plate saved me, because water has been dripping on to the back of it.  I wiped off dried green coolant of my GPU.  As far as I can tell, my GTX 960 is none worse for the wear.That it leaked to me is the kiss of death. Do not buy."," To give more pop, I swapped the stock fans for 2 Cougar green LED fans.

9SIA66Z29E8183,2YM-0002-00001,5/25/2016 2:51:09 AM,Tyler Z.,Very pleased! - UPDATE - Not anymore,1," *UPDATE* I no longer recommend this cooler to anyone.  It still looks great, performs well and offers customization, the cracking issue isn't limited to certain colors as I had previously suspected.  Perhaps it's a stress issue where the addition of another reservior could relieve this and prevent the cracking, but until Rajintek release 2.0 version or something with a redesigned block I would strongly advise looking elsewhere.Inexpensive, keeps my 4770k ice cold, looks amazing, expandable, just downright great.While idling, the fans don't even turn on and the system is completely silent. At load the fans have a bit more hum than the white noise of my 780s but still minimal."," *UPDATE* The acrylic on mine has finally cracked.  My case has inverted mounting for the motherboard so the CPU is on the bottom.  When I looked in my computer yesterday, I noticed there was a puddle sitting on the PSU.  I'm very thankful my motherboard is inverted or this puddle would have been on the back of one of my graphics cards.  As you can see from the previous text, I was very happy with this cooler and even thought that I had somehow avoided the cracking issue with miney...but no such luck anymore. A lot of people say the acrylic (""cheap plastic"" to some that know nothing about composites) had cracked but I've had mine for nearly a year and see no cracks forming.The tubes are quite long and prone to kinking as shipped.   They are, however, very easy to remove, trim and reattach."," *UPDATE* I have stopped the leak with some superglue for now as I wait for the components to build a custom loop.  The one I purchased for a friend is still installed but will be replaced by the weekend.  While these coolers perform very well and offer customizability, I simply can't recommend them...not unless you're only going to have it installed for a short period of time.  Some say they've had cracking only a couple of months in, I was lucky enough to have over a year, but there's no rhyme or reason to when or why it happens.Like I said in the cons, I trimmed the lines to the length I needed and pour everything back together.  It looks like a custom loop now since everything is fitted and routed very neatly.  I spilled some coolant and it was just low enough that the pump would occasionally push a lot of tiny bubbles through.  I ran it this way until more coolant arrived to top it off and the pump still runs just fine. Many months later. I am concerned by the number of reviewers with cracked acrylic blocks but have yet to see a single fracture after nearly year.  My concern is lessened because I have an Azza CSAZ GT 1 set up inverted so my CPU is at the bottom.",1,1

9SIA66Z29E8183,2YM-0002-00001,4/17/2016 4:36:22 AM,H&R C.,Excellent product,5," All in one product that's can expand wirh your budgetCompletely customizable Decent color options as well as radiator sizesWorks flawlesslyCup block has it's own pump (I added a 250mm reservoir and didnt need an additional pump, since the one I'm the block is obviously submersible. Though you should keep the reservoir at or below the level of your block for gravitational purposes).Cup block has 2 led's that are fairly bright"," The only flaw I see with this product, is that while you can change everything else, you can't remove the barbs from the cpu block or the radiator, so if you want to get a new radiator or block, you have to purchase fittings. If you change out everything like I did, (except the cpu block) then you can't change the fittngs. I purchased new titan rig fittings and was disappointed that I couldn't use them on my cup block, but that's trivial.I'be heard others say there's came with a leak, but mine has no issues. Make sure there's no condensation and do a leak test with a jumper outside of the case, just to be sure, and check the tightness of your fittings."," All in all a fantastic product for the price. Upgraded the radiator to a 480mm, added a 250mm radiator, added a gpu water block, changed the fluids to hydrx uv green liquid, uv green tubes, and titan rig compression fittings. This was absolutely worth the money. It costs the same or cheaper than all in ones that are closed loops, so I would go this direction for sure.P.S. - the compression fitting size is 3/8 id (inside diameter) by 1/2 od  (outside diameter) and standard G1/4 threading.",None,None

The acrylic pump housing will crack from heat and vibration then it will leak on your graphics card within 6 months.," Read the reviews, most are edited later saying it cracked.When I drained mine and inspected it there were 4 separate cracks around the pump motor and one very large one on the outside of the case.

9SIA66Z29E8183,2YM-0002-00001,1/26/2016 7:47:44 PM,Daniel R.,Amazing,4," Looks amazing and the installation was easy. The flexible tubing allows for the block to be positioned very easily compared to other very stiff tubing on other AIO coolers. Mounting is easy and solid and overall very few complaints on this unit! Cools very well, I have it set to keep my CPU idling at 35c which is a tad high BUT I do this because the fans spin slow, and never once has my CPU gone over 55 at full load, amazing.","  Tubing is... long. I don't know why its THIS long. I have a full tower case and theres an excess of tubing that bends onto the window of my case. Raijintek should take a good .5"" to 1"" off of the tubing. Annoying, but not enough to take an egg off.Another note is that I had emailed Raijintek on whether or not the packaging for the Triton had been fixed as many users were reporting leaking due to the transport of the unit in shipping. Due to the packaging not being very stellar, the block would get damaged. Raijintek had emailed me back saying they did fix the packaging and ACKNOWLEDGED the original packaging was bad. Other sites had also AFFIRMED that Raijintek had told them they were fixing the packaging. However, when my unit had arrived the packaging looked identical to everything i had seen from reviews with a single flimsy foam shaped block for the water coolers block and just cardboard... Buyers beware, I expect there may still be some chance your unit may arrive damaged PLEASE inspect before installing. I almost took an egg off for this but I'm very pleased because mine arrived undamaged and works well.EDIT: 6 months after owning this product, the cpu block/reservoir acrylic cracked very randomly. After working perfectly I came home after my computer was OFF for two days to find the block had cracked and leaked. I'm very lucky to own a Silverstone case where my graphics card is mounted away from  harm. Raijintek did, however, send a replacement block with express shipping with included dyes and liquid, so good on them for their quality service, still, I'm docking an egg for this reason, should NOT happen."," Some tips. One, Raijintek suggests you use the included 'spreader' tool to spread thermal paste. Don't do this, its a terrible way to spread thermal paste. Get a nice tube of IC Diamond or Artic Silver or whatever is your choice. Put a small (about the size of an uncooked grain of rice) dab in the middle of your cpu and install the block onto it. The flat nickle of the waterblock will evenly spread the paste for you.Second, connect the pump's power (the 3 pin fan header) to a molex power supply connector using a converter. The pump is super silent so its no issue if it runs at 100%.Third and last, buy some other static pressure fans, I went with Corsair's Green LED SP fans, they work amazingly, and only add more flare to the cooler.",None,None

Luckily I caught it quickly and put the stock intel air cooler on.

I could not mount it using screws, had to resort to zip ties. Though I don't think its the products fault, it might just be my case??? Im not sure. But installing aftermarket fans (corsair SP120) were a pain and only 3/4 and sometimes 2/4 screws would be able to screw into the rad. I do think it's the rad itself leading to these mounting problems but im not 100% sure. "," WATER BLOCK CRACKED 5 MONTHS INTO USE...Yes, the waterblock itself cracked underneath and overtime the red-dyed water began dripping onto my GPU. I hadn't noticed until I was bored one day and decided to open my case and notice my GPU circuit bored and MOBO was covered in this red-dried liquid. I immediately contacted Raijinitek about the issue and they sent me a replacement block along with new coolant and 3 dyes (yellow,blue and red) I also lost the mounting screws to mount the waterblock and emailed them asking if I could recieve any replacements and they sent me the screws within the same day. Though the waterblock may have just been a random occurence, I commend Raijinitek and their awesome customer service and fast replies.",0,1

Noticed CPU heat was climbing and staying. So I ordered this nice looking liquid cooling system and got it within 3 days. After install, noticed the metal bracket is a bit loose or doesn't tighten too well, but it seems to stay without rattle. The waterblock also seemed a bit wobbly so i just used some electrical tap around the base of the block. It was the only thing available to me at the time. That seemed to stop it from shifting about. Next was the length of the tubes. They are a bit long and I'm sure I could shorten them but I'm not too worried. After running my PC I noticed the noise from the fans instantly and had to change them immediately. Note to reader, If you plan on buying this, buy 2 other fans as well unless you have 2 to spare. The stock fans are just way too noisy for my liking. Other than that it does the job well, my PC is running very cool with CPU being as low as 60 - 70 degrees. When replacing the stock fans, the instructions said there was connector cables but I did not receive any.

Only a few days since install and it is capable and handling the job.  No issues with shipping, hoses and fittings are perfect.  Radiator fans included aren't the best, but they get the job done and can be upgraded easily.  An extra set of hands when mounting custom plates on board was helpful.   i7-4790 on a z97 pro board well over 10% OC and it did not break a sweat.  Pump is smooth and quiet.

I can't tell you how happy I am with the performance of this kit, and have had no issue with the build quality. The radiator included is solid and durable which is a big plus. I did replace the fans with some corsair static pressure led fans over the factory ones included. Keeps my system in the 27-30 degree Celsius range while idle to light loads. I will also say that I am using Arctic silver thermal paste over the included paste as well. Great buy, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something with that little something extra if you're looking for a AIO water cooler.

I'm overclocked at 4.4ghz and it hasn't even flinched. I keep the fans turned down to where I can barely hear them. Mounting in my case (Corsair Air 540) was no problem at all. I did run a Corsair H100i previously and replaced it with this. I was over the all black unit. It was time for some clear tubing and cool green coolant. I have read some people had busted units or loose filler caps out of the box and I feel for those guys. Nothing worse than a h2o system you can't trust. Been there done that. But I haven't had a single issue with this system yet. My computer runs 24/7. I never shut it off. Only my monitor and my case lights. Pump is nice and quiet and seems to pump fluid although it's hard to tell without a flow meter inline. I will say if you're thinking about trying this one out give it a shot. It's made well and works great not to mention the aesthetics of it. Just make sure you test this dude out of your case first. This is number one rule with any h2o system.," None really. The only one is the length of the pump wire. I'm a neat freak with my cables and the pump wire has to be pulled around the reservoir to reach my fan header. It's too tight and could be about an inch or so longer. I don't care much for the white fan blades. Wish they'd have been black or at least clear. And I'm with the others with the fan rheostat. I'd prefer a 4 wire so the system can regulate fan speed or I can override for manual control. I'd also opt for a 4 wire on the pump as it'd be nice to see pump speed. Oh, and one last thing. Don't let the pics fool you. There isn't 3 bottles of dye. This system comes pre-configured in red, blue, or green. No extra dye for a flush and refill. I'd prefer a clear coolant and a choice of dye colors. I mean it doesn't take much to dye a litre of fluid. It's not so much of a con as it is a personal preference. All in all this is a great h2o setup with upgrade options for a low price. This is a new product so hopefully they take this feedback and make some changes and improvements.",,2,2

Water transfer tubes are robust and pump has a simpler installation vs the older H110., Pump failed after 3 1/2 months causing damage to my motherboard.

Both the pump block and radiator have a nice looking trim piece that takes what used to be fairly ugly but functional components and makes them look sleek and modern."," Depending on your case and setup, you may find the fans a bit noisy.  In my open-air test bench they were certainly audible but I wouldn't say they were irritatingly so.  When I moved it to a case, I found the fans hardly noticable."," I have really grown to like the Raijintek coolers for their flexibility and customization options along with excellent cooling capacity.  However, I found that the H110i actually performed better (undoubtedly the 280mm radiator helped over the 240).  These Corsair systems also don't suffer from the evaporating coolant issues I've had with the Triton or the cracking block.The Corsair Link software adds a nice touch.  It will adjust fan speeds, monitor temps and change the settings for the LEDs on the pump.  If you're going for an illuminated machine, this is a nice custom touch.  There's even settings to have it change color depending on CPU temp if you so desire.While I've transitioned away from AIO liquid cooling in most of my builds, a sealed unit does have the benefit of low maintenance.  After testing this H110i, it's definitely my top choice from here on.",None,None

I can't hear it at all unless I get close to it, - Fans can get a bit loud at times," Might be worth trying to find another fan if you find them to be too loud. Thankfully there is a quiet profile on my motherboard to keep the fan speeds at low levels. Yes the CPU runs a bit warmer but still well within specs. I tested on two platforms. Z97 and X99. The Z97 motherboard had an Intel Core i7 4790K CPU overclocked to 4.5 GHz. Temps for that setup yielded about 30-40c at idle and at load never peaked above 70c. The X99 motherboard utilized an Intel Core i7 5930K CPU with a  TDP much higher than the Devil's Canyon CPU (4790K). Even overclocked at 4 GHz I am able to keep temps in the 50s at idle and below or at 70c at load. Both tests are with the fans on auto but quiet profiles. The pump was set to maximum performance.Overall I've been quite happy with not only this product, but all of the Corsair AIO water coolers. They perform well and have yet to fail on me. My first one is going strong still even after 4 years. I highly recommend.",2,2

As long as stock fans are swapped out for a 3 pin variety and the motherboard is able to turn fans off based on temperatures, a very quiet system can be achieved. Your mileage may vary based on processor used and existing airflow throughout the case.",1,1
N82E16835181101,35-181-101,7/16/2016 4:07:18 PM,Brian M.,King of the AIO Watercoolers,5," Running my overclocked 4670K at 1.25v CPU vcore (4.4 GHz), with the stock cooler it was reaching around 75-80C in gaming, with a 212 EVO it was lowered into the high 60's.  In attempting to push a higher overclock, the H110i Extreme dropped it down further to an impressive 50C, allowing me to reach 4.6 GHz!This watercooler uses a dual 140mm setup, among the best available for all-in-one coolers, the stock fans are much quieter than my previous air cooled heatsinks.  They are modular, they can be removed and replaced with 2 other fans if you desire stronger/quieter cooling capacity.The new flexible tubes that Corsair recently started using are very convenient as well, the bend and twist very easily, which makes organizing the interior of your chassis a breeze.  You don't have to worry about the rigid/ribbed tubes getting caught on other cables.  Installation was also much easier than other coolers, especially the beefy air-cooled heatsinks.  Simply place the block on the CPU and screw through the motherboard into the backplate and you're done.This cooler also supports Corsair Link when you plug-in the included cable to your motherboard.  Corsair Link provides temperature monitoring, fan/profile control, as well as LED color customization for the block itself.  Overall it's a great program that provides the exact featureset and accessibility you would expect, although of course it's not required for the H110i to work.Having been a Corsair customer for over 10 years, I've always been impressed by their customer service and RMA procedures.  They've always responded to my tickets within a few hours, and they were always very friendly and eager to provided product replacements when necessary.  Their high-quality products and the great way they treat their customers has always kept me coming back!"," Corsiar's stock fans on their watercoolers has always been a point of contention and unfortunately it stands true today.  There are better 140mm fans to use on your radiator, which can be both quieter and more efficient.  That being said, unless you're attempting to build the ultimate silent PC, the provided fans are more than capable and I can't really complain too much.  Premium fans can be quite pricey and it would be unreasonable for Corsair to inflate the price of their AIOs for only a small benefit.I don't own any AMD rigs, but I have come across many complaints from users about backplate incompatibilities on their motherboard; if you have an AMD system, make sure it's compatible with both your socket and mobo type!"," Thermal paste is already provided on the block, I used Arctic MX-4 for my testing.  With paste being incredibly cheap these days, you might consider replacing the stock paste with your own!  You can remove a few extra degrees from your temperatures, and high-quality paste will probably have a longer lifespan, as well.",2,2
N82E16835181101,35-181-101,7/14/2016 7:22:47 AM,J C.,Love Corsair! Not this..,4," I bought this radiator thinking  that it was going to be as good as my H100 when I built an AMD rig two years ago. I was finally making the step up to Intel after getting enough disposable income, and wanted to go big or go home. I bought this, and was at first incredibly pleased. It kept my PC cool at idle (~26-29C) while I downloaded my life again, and quiet too in my Phanteks Eclipse case."," Then, however, when I started playing games.. The fans would always kick in to 100% (2,500 RPM according the Corsair Link) as soon as it notched over 30C. Corsair link gave me NO control over this what so ever, even when I changed profiles, this was always the case. It sounded like my PC was going to taxi to the run way and take off any second, and this just isn't doable when I live somewhere were my indoors temp is usually 90F or 32C to begin with. So I thought to myself, ""Hey, I put Noctua fans on my H100 back when, I'll just spend fifty dollars on a couple new fans and life will be good again!"" Not the case, unfortunately.. When I put the Noctua fans on, the pumps' LEDs would flash in a variety of colors, and the H110 would not show on the Corsair Link program. It was a LOT quieter, though, and the performance was equally optimal. However, fearing it would break and / or damage the pump, I changed it back and put my beloved Noctuas as a push/pull connected to the motherboard rather than the H110's 4-pin connectors. Corsair link, to reiterate, gives me zero real control over anything. I try and change a value, nothing happens, and it tells me that the item isn't 'functioning properly' because it's not falling within the set parameters I give it and doing its own thing instead. Also, if your case says it has clearance for a 280mm radiator, make sure it has at least another two full inches in either direction, because this big boy really let himself go. I had to take out my drive bay, and that was so it would fit on the 360MM radiator front-side of the case. And it does so just barely."," All in all, I would NOT buy this again, and will be seeking to return it. I expected a LOT better from Corsair, as I am relatively a fan boy of their other products. My last setup ran a Corsair C70 case, H100, Corsair SSD, Corsair RAM, Corsair M65 K90 and even my mousepad is Corsair. The peripherals are still what I'm using. Many of my friends have bought Corsair because of me, and many friends whom of which I built PC's for, I used as many Corsair parts as I could. This, unfortunately, was a most disappointing revelation, and will leave me hesitant when it comes to purchasing Corsair heat sinks in the future.",1,3

My original title for this review was “Possible overkill, definite performance” and, although it very much applies, it wasn’t much in the way of a “hook.”  I touched on the size element of this cooler in the Cons section, so that should suffice.  A cooler this size is made to cool the top-end processors and, if coolers have thoughts, mine probably thought to itself “This job is not worthy of my blade” (fan blades, of course – loosely quoting Goemon from the anime classic Castle of Cagliostro).  I say this because it is cooling an AMD FX-6300 moderately overclocked to 4GHz.  I ran Prime95 for 5 hours to test stability and the cores never went above 35°.  An old audio adage goes something like this… More amplification gives you higher definition at lower volumes.  It seems to somewhat apply here, from the aspect of the quality of the experience.  Even though it isn’t the best and the fastest processor, it serves its function well, is mission-critical and it is nice to know that my processor “lives in a cool place” all of the time – idling at around 15° and generally staying in the low 20s.  I installed the Corsair Link software, which gives you full monitoring of the pump RPM, the 2 fans and the cooler temp, as well as the motherboard-related temps & fan RPMs.  It does its job well and my one critique of the software, albeit minor, is in the cons section.  Overall, I didn’t believe I could be more of a Corsair fanboy than I already was, but they continue up the bar on impressing me!

I thought that I’d need a lot more “stuff” (pump, fluid, power) in order to use liquid cooling, but this includes everything you need. It took less than 2 hours to remove the old cooler, clean the CPU, and install the H110i.Silent. My case is much quieter now, and the radiator is much more form efficient than my previous air cooler.Cooling performance is great. I was able to lower the overall/average temp of my CPU by a few degrees C, while simultaneously overclocking it for the first time.This is a great replacement for stock/air coolers. The installation was not any more difficult that installing an aftermarket air cooler.Form factor is good, and the design is great. This really looks good inside my case!Everything you need is in the box. This literally could not be any easier to install.", None," I am using a Cooler Master HAF-X case, and I had to drill a few holes into the chassis in order to mount the radiator. There are a few good videos on this on YouTube, so take a look at one of those if you’re planning to mount this into a HAF-X.I used this to replace a ZALMAN 135mm air CPU cooler. I really liked that cooler compared to all of the stock coolers I’ve had, but it took up quite a bit of space inside my case. This unit obviously keeps the CPU cooler, and takes up only a fraction of the space.I’m running an AMD FX-8150 @ 4.2GHz (stock 3.6GHz) and temperatures never even got close to hot. AMD OverDrive was reporting anywhere between 40-45 C whereas Corsair LINK was showing 30 C (under load).

N82E16835181101,35-181-101,3/24/2016 10:05:45 AM,Matthew M.,Excellent AIO cooler for the price...,4," The 280mm rad is most definitely nice, as 140mm fans are simply quieter than 120mm fans when moving the same amount of air. I'm directly comparing this product to Corsair's own H100i, which uses a 240mm rad and is much louder when those fans spin up with the CPU at full load. While the H100i performed great cooling my OC'ed i7 4790K, as I said the noise level was higher and there was also this annoying bug with the RGB LED in Corsair Link. This bug caused the LED on the Corsair logo to change colors after a cold reboot and was very upsetting to me and many others that experienced it. I was able to finally workaround this bug, but it took a lot of troubleshooting. I had no such issues with the H110i and the newest version of Corsair link, which I'm happy to report. Compared to my H100i, I had on average a nice 5-8C drop in temperature. Sometimes even more, depending on the ambient temp. But overall, this cooler trounced the H100i, which you would expect but I honestly did not expect it to by this big of a margin. This seriously impressed me, especially considering how much quieter it is. The overall look of the cooler is very pleasing. I like the new design, although I also loved the H100i as well. I like how they put the grey strips and logos on the 280mm rad. It makes for a really nice touch. Installation was very strait-forward on my LGA 1150 socket. I didn't have any issues there. I also just used the supplied thermal compound instead of changing it out for something more exotic. In the past I've found that whatever thermal compound Corsair is using is of a very high quality, so in my opinion there's really no need to change it. This makes installation even easier as it's already applied perfectly and ready to install out of the box, with great performance I might add. Previously using my H100i, setting my core voltage on my 4790K to 1.3v was not very practical as it would get a little hot for my liking. But with the H110i I can use this voltage and keep it within safe temps easily, which allowed me to get another 200Mhz easily while remaining perfectly stable. To me that was just great because I felt like I was restricted before. Now I feel as if I can really let my CPU stretch its legs without worrying. I don't like to push my hardware unless I can keep the temps under control and I'm pickier than most OC'ers in that respect. I have to say that Corsair Link is very nice these days. In the past I've had some issues with Corsair's software. From their keyboards, mice, and Link software. But it has improved steadily and it's finally at a point where it's become free of most bugs and easy to use. I really like how the Link software shows you a picture of your case and lets you assign the fans you can control to their respective positions. Once you get it all set up, it's very easy to control everything and you'll have no problems knowing exactly which fan you're dealing with. For whatever reason I have two fans in my system it does not detect (all my fans are 3 pin so it doesn't NEED 4 pin fans), but those are two fans that I can control with my motherboard anyway. I have them set at 100% and they are staying there. All the fans that matter, I can control with Corsair Link. The pump and block design seems of a higher quality than earlier builds. It's just heavier so I believe the backplate has a bit more meat to it, which only means it will absorb heat better. Always a plus in my book. The packaging was very neat and that's always the case with any Corsair product. No complaints there at all. You could probably drop it 20 feet onto pavement and nothing would get damaged! All in all just a great AIO cooler with performance that's insanely impressive."," Corsair's naming conventions are EXTREMELY confusing at this time. I guess for 2016 they decided to rename all their Hydro series products but didn't change much, except for slightly tweaking the blocks to make them easier to install onto smaller microATX boards. This cooler is exactly the same as the H110i GT. I have scoured both products as far as the specs go and can't find anything to suggest they changed anything when comparing the GT version to the newer H110i, other than perhaps a slight tweak to the overall size of the block (but even that is not confirmed). I hate when companies re-badge products with new names, especially when the names are so similar. It's confusing to buyers and those of us looking for info on which cooler to buy. But rest assured, this cooler will perform the same as the H110i GT, so keep that in mind if you're reading some other reviews. The 280mm radiator does limit which cases can support this beast of a cooler. I used to have a Corsair 800D, and while it's getting a bit long in the tooth as far as it's age, it's plenty big enough for a cooler like this. However, it DOES NOT support this cooler by default as it can only handle a 240mm rad (or 360 rad which uses 3x120mm fans) at the max. Even trying to mod the top of the 800D for this cooler would be tough due to the recess in it. It's just not even worth trying, which is why I decided to get a 750D, which supports a 280mm rad by default and has some newer features in it like front USB 3.0 ports (yeah the 800D is THAT old, although it does have a 3.0 upgrade kit if you can manage to find it). Just be sure your case can support this cooler before dropping the cash on it. The fans that come with this cooler are loud for 140mm fans. You could reduce the noise levels further by replacing them with some good Noctua fans, or perhaps some other 140mm fans using fluid-dynamic bearings. Corsair has some great fans available that are better than what is supplied with this product. That said, it's not something you HAVE to do, just something you MAY want to do."," Other than Corsair's confusing naming convention, they have really came a long way over the years. All their current products have a level of excellence rarely seen these days when comparing them to other vendors. They could still use some more work on the software side of things, but I am seeing improvements so I have to hand it to them there. I just wish they would move faster in that area. All that said, I highly recommend this cooler. The only reason I took an egg off is because of the limited case support, as plenty of cases don't support the 280mm rad by default. Performance wise, this thing is a beast and the price is extremely reasonable. Another great product for Corsair!",4,4

It came with the original AMD type mounting ring(this is an upgrade from the H75 which used a 4 screw mount) the LEDS are cool even though I can't see them in my case lol.it was cheaper than the older versions of it.", It is big! And I mean bigger than the previous versions in length. so it doesn't fit right in my case which is a newer design made to use 280mm radiators.  In neither of the spec'd positions would it fit right. it was about 1.5mm off from perfect mounting holes. I got it to fit in the front but it was a tight squeeze.  not Corsairs fault totally I get that. but the extra metal they use on the ends make it a harder fit. I got it because my case is made for that size. they could get rid of the space between the fans and it would have no issues fitting in any case. not enough to take an egg off for me but it was unexpected. for the $$ it costs I would like to see it come with the Regular version of the SP fans. and maybe 2 LN adaptors .," I am very happy with my buy, it allows me to overclock my CPU at much higher rate than the H75 I had before. it could be 2mm wider to seal the fans better against the frame.  and swivels on the radiator would also be helpful in the installing process.  I did replace the fans with Noctua NF series fans as I didn't like the SPs on my h75. it is the round frame fitment on a square radiator. I don't like air leaks it is inefficient and a waste of space. I am thinking of using one of the SP140ls to put in the middle of the radiator fo push air through the gap between the fans. This thing IS TOTALLY WORTH THE BUY!!!!!! here is the basics of my temps. @4.8Ghz and 1.488v on an AMD 8350(125w TDP) idle on the net w/case closed, doing this CPU is 37c. I ran Prime95(max heat setting) on this setup and with case open(i.e. no fan filter and front door open) it kept the CPU at 59c average.  gaming on fallout4 ultra settings, CPU got to 48-51 on a balanced fan profile.  I use a silent case which makes idle temps go up about 4-6c so if I yank out the fan filter it drops the temps so take that as you like.  it is a killer cooler for your CPU needs.",None,None
N82E16835181101,35-181-101,3/17/2016 12:33:18 PM,Kristopher K.,A great product that has improved with each generation...,4," Let me start by saying that an AIO cooler for my build isn't my first choice, but it also isn't my last. I'm currently planning a custom loop for my configuration and this will be my 3rd (yes 3rd) AIO cooler I have tested/reviewed. I own the original H110 from several years ago, the H100i GTX, and now the H110i. Don't ask why I have so many, I just do.I can honestly say having used all 3 within the recent future on the same configuration, I can say there is a 2-4C drop in my core CPU temps as I progress towards the newest model, being the H110i. The H110 didn't have the USB interface, controllable pump speed or any of the other fancy stuff in the software. The H100i GTX built upon that in the 120mm configuration and added the USB interface and all the bells and whistles. It did reduce my temps from the H110 using the same PUSH/PULL configuration. This brings me to this model, the H110i, which has further improved upon the H110 and the H100i GTX.They did change the radiator design from a rounded edge to a square edge, not sure why, but it doesn't matter to me. They changed how the pump mounts on both sides. Meaning the backplate used to be a plastic type material and now they are using metal, which I like, feels more sturdy. They also changed the pump design and how it mounts to the backplate. All in all I would say these were improvements and made the installation and removal quite easy. The pump did come with a paste pre-installed, which unless you plan on taking it off for testing like I frequently do, just leave it alone. I ended up removing mine and going with the best in the industry (IMO), Thermal Grizzly. I saw a minor improvement in my core and load temps after applying that over the stock paste.All in all, I'm not going to divulge my idle and core temps because I'm not the norm. My Skylake has been delided and had custom paste put in place of the stock Intel paste. It was such a significant drop in temps that providing them here would skew the reviews of others. Leave it to this, this pump is by far the best at removing heat from an overclocked i5 Skylake (4.9Ghz/1.424V)."," The cons...I will just get right there and say the fans. I can't emphasize this enough, the fans are loud. Sure, they might be quiet when running in silent mode, but why would I want that when I'm overclocking? I literally almost immediately replaced them with Noctuas that at full speed, have equal or better static pressure and are much quieter.Another con is the tubing. Having owned the older H110, it was so much more flexible and easy to work with. I'm not sure why they changed it, maybe that instances of breaking/leaking with it, but mine never did. This new tubing on the H110i is so stiff I worried in the beginning about the torsional stress it was placing on my MB."," Would I recommend this in place of a custom loop or massive air cooler? Sure, but it depends on your needs individually. If you want your case to look clean, improve air flow from your case fans and keep the noise down, then go with an AIO cooler from Corsair. If money isn't an option and you live dangerously, go custom and be happy. And those with the massive air coolers...sure they are cheaper (relatively) and have almost equal performance to this AIO cooler, but they don't make your case look minimalist/clean and they are just down right ugly.",None,None
N82E16835181101,35-181-101,3/16/2016 4:24:07 PM,Travis D.,Amazing performace,4," It keeps my cpu at about 27 degrees Celsius which is perfect! The design is really sleek, and the added small touches really make a difference. For example, the device that covers the cpu itself, there are leds which can be programmed to indicate the temperature the cpu currently rests at. Which if you have a see through area on your case is really helpful. Also the ability to download the software and get all the information from the motherboard directly is a huge plus. I can now easily see all the temperatures of every device plugged in to my system and I can change all kinds of settings related to fan and pump speed. The install wasn't so easy though I imagine a larger more modern case would have made that easier.It was very quiet as I knew it would be but I have to say I could hear the pump in that silence which got to be kind of annoying, but that's just me being over critical."," The worst part about this was its installation engineering. In todays day and age, cases come in all shapes and sizes, I figure if the motherboard that fits the cpu can fit in the case, then so can the watercooler that says it fits the cpu. The problem I had was that it was WAY too big for my case, not so much of a problem though, I'll just mount it outside of the case, however that led to more problems. The problem of screw holes lining up. Even if this fit in to the case I knew I had no screw holes where the manual intended them to be. I ended up drilling a few holes and hooking the radiator to the case in my own way. A good way around this for future engineers would be to allow for adjustable screw holes to fit hundreds of more pc cases. Seriously. Last little issue I had was that once I had this hooked up, I wasn't really instructed where to go from there. I actually didn't know there was software, I just figured there was because why else would the cooler have a hookup to the motherboard through usb? I did a quick google search and from there it was easy. The usb thing is another problem though, it took up a whole port on my motherboard which is very modern, only about a year old. Which meant to configure my cooler, I had to unhook a cable which went to two of the ports on the front of the case. Not a huge issue I guess but a different hookup would have been more enjoyable."," All in all, for the money, with the right case, this is worth the buy, my issues were most likely not a common thing, which is why I only took one egg off for the problems. I know if my case was perfectly fitted this could have been a ten minute installation no problem.",0,1

It’s easy to use and also helps monitor and define what areas of the case need cooling attention by monitoring many other thermal sensors (mobo, CPU, chipset, Video card etc.)."," Upon opening the box I noticed the Aluminum radiator fins were damaged. This likely doesn’t change the radiators ability to cool much but it looks tacky having a few spots where the fins are mashed flat. There is no way to know if this happen during shipment or at the factory.If you plan to use this in a machine requiring extreme cooling under load, be prepared to deal with VERY noisy fans at high speed. For my purposes however I will never see any CPU stress to speak of. There may be quieter fans available but look for fans with higher static pressure to push air through the obstructive radiator fins.The radiator comes with 140mm fans. Mid tower case options are limited. I wanted to use the rear exhaust fan in my Fractal Designs Arc Midi R2 case so I oriented the water hoses just behind the 5-1/4 bays.

I had a collection of used parts and purchased a used Z77 board from (e} bay. I wanted a fairly quiet machine that would not be audible while listening to music. I did a mild overclock to 4GHz as this ASRock board’s BIOS allows non-K Intel CPU multipliers to be changed. I also used the Prolimatech PK3 thermal grease and not the stock grease. The biggest ordeal was finding a mid-tower case to fit the large radiator+fans. Larger full towers should be more forgiving. I needed to fit the system into less than 20 inches of vertical space. The control software is just plain brilliant. The pump LED can change color as the temps increase. This case has a side window that shows the motherboard and water pump. The control software allows the LED in the top of the pump to change colors at 3 user defined temperatures. My idle temps for the 1st core hover around 89F overclocked to 4GHz. I had a competing vendors top dual 120mm closed loop cooler 5 years ago. After a year it developed an issue with air bubble and would not pump. I would have to shake the system violently to get the air bubbles past the pump so it would circulate water. It eventually failed. Only time will tell if Corsair can make a reliable closed loop cooler. I will not use this system very often so it should last me at least 5 years. If it fails like the last one then I will likely never buy another water cooling system again.,None,None

They have great packaging, great compliance with existing platforms, and great designs."," Price?  It's not really a con when you consider the savings on replacing cpu's due to heat issues...But otherwise, it's a little higher than closely comparable air based hsf's."," Overall I feel like  the only people considering this HSF are overclockers.

But when I incorporate the h110i i'm stuck wondering if it could be better.  For my comparison, it is definitely better, not to mention the better than air cooled temps, at water cooled temps that are comparable, but not as costly.  To that end, this is a better than average cooling option for anyone that is overclocking their computers.  The questions arise when you start to compare air vs water...then does it make sense.  When you consider both sides, this closed loop system is the best of both worlds.  It gives you better than air system performance at closed loop water performance.

The power is supplied by a SATA power connector instead of legacy molex connector.The performance of the cooler is almost completely dictated your level of fan noise tolerance.  The included static pressure fans can be set anywhere from a near completely silent 800 rpm to a maddening  2000 rpm that I doubt anyone could tolerate.  Personally, I set the fans at a flat 900 rpm with wired resistors (see cons) for a consistent quiet system at all times. My i5 6500k  overclocked to 4.4 ghz under stock voltage idles at 30 degree C and in the 50-60 degree C range under gaming load with ambient temperatures in the mid 70 deg F. The RGB waterblock LED can be set to a static color, cycle through the entire color range, or better yet set to correspond to temperature or fan speed of the CPU or water temp or any other detected device like video card, HDD, SSD or case temp sensor (why you would is beyond me but you have that option). I have mines set to corresponds to the water temperature of the H110i."," One of the two supplied fan developed a rattle around the 1000-1200 rpm range after just two weeks, minus one egg. The fans also spin up at max rpm when the system is initially turned on, restarted, etc. Ultimately, I replaced the bad fan and wired both with a resistors directly to the 3 pin connectors and bypassed the Corsair software. Now they spin at very quiet constant 900 rpm at all times.", The USB connector uses a internal USB 2.0 port on the motherboard. This may be a con depending on your motherboard and you may have to choose between front USB2.0 panel or CorsairLink. My motherboard has 2 USB 2.0 ports so this is not an issue for me.,None,None

My case is a CM690 II, a larger mid-ATX case in my opinion. I had to mod my case to fit it in (or on, rather) (see OTs).> Warranty: “5 year Corsair Guarantee.”> Instructions: Overall clear and easy to follow, with Intel and AMD instructions separate. At times some parts seem misleading, but instructions are over all straightforward and no broken English. (For example, it [rightfully] says to intake air, yet I thought the arrows in the picture seemed to show air exhaust. Read the text word-by-word and instructions are clearer!)> Tubes: Thick and girthy for liquid flow to/from the massive radiator. Yet, they are also very malleable and soft to the touch. (My old Seidon 120M had stiff, thin and hard plastic tubes.)> Build/Construction: Sturdy, high quality. Radiator is nearly flawless with no bent fins. This leads me to believe there are no quality control issues...however see note about aesthetics in cons.> Compatibility: As expected, high [backwards] compatibility for Intel LGA 1150/1/5/6, 1366, 2011(-3) and AMD AM2/3 and FM 1/2.> Corsair logo: Printed on the side of the radiator, the emblem is reversible. Tubes facing down and the logo is right side up, on the opposite side it is flipped. The CPU attachment lights up with the Corsair logo (referred to as “the sensor” in the software, where it can be disabled or color changed.)> Pre-applied thermal paste: Convenient and, assuming it is in line with the rest of the H-series lineup, it is high quality Shin-etsu paste.> Fan headers: With the on-board fan headers, this cooler actually freed up extra fan ports (although I use a fan controller anyway.)===FANS:===These are much improved over older models. High pressure, high RPM, relatively quiet. Very high quality. Spinning one with my finger, compared to quiet case fan, feels like spinning a ceiling fan compared to a box fan.2x SP140L brushless PWM: Size: 140mm. RPM: 2100 +/- 210.Noise: 43dB(a).Airflow: 113 CFM.=== Software:===Overall: Very customizable and functional.> Appearance: Red/black default theme with white text, can be changed to any color/black and any color text. > Fan profiles: Quiet, Balanced and Performance, can set to specific % or RPM fan speed.> Temperature notifications: Can set macros like “At [temperature] do”: shutdown PC [after x minutes], run a file, trigger all RGB LEDs to [color], set fans to 100%.> Can change the logo/sensor color to any color on the spectrum, or set to black color to disable light completely.> Not a pro, but: Only natively for Windows (See OTs for linux.)=== Temps === (Mostly using balanced setting. Hottest CPU core, per Corsair’s Link software in Win10 x64. Setup is with the fans pushing through the radiator at the top of my case.)CPU: Idle, my 6700k throttles to around 2Ghz pulling less than 10W. Turbo is at 4.65Ghz @ 90W TDP.Idle: 17.5 to 20C (depending on ambient temp.)Casual load (2% to 35% use, depending): up to 33C (booting up, loading many apps and widgets, browsing the internet, etc).100% load (encoding a Bluray): 56C (Performance, fans at 100%) to 60C (balanced)! Silent setting still didn't pass 70C!Note: Set to quiet mode, idle/casual use results are similar to balanced.When encoding completes, temps promptly drop to 24C, and taper down to idle 17-20C again. Beautiful.For comparison, my previous Seidon 120M: Idle: 23C +/- 5.Casual load: 35C to 43C, depending.100% load: spiked to 86C (yikes!)"," [1] This isn’t really a con for me, but more of a note about aesthetics for those to whom it matters. A few of the screw mounts looked sloppily drilled and one even had rust buildup. (The cooler is made in China, which production quality has improved over the years.) Over all, I’d still consider this an exceptional product with high build quality.[2] As of this review, the Corsair Link software is only natively for Windows. Due to Windows 10, I’ve recently moved primarily back to Linux (except dual-booting for Steam/gaming) and would love to see a *nix binary.This cooler uses a USB-connected on-board power supply and controller for its fans. I haven't tried connecting the fans directly to my controller, but in theory it should work. In doing so, I'd lose software control and all the benefits thereof. Will test in the future."," This cooler has definitely earned a solid 5-eggs. For me, ~$120 would probably be on the high end for buying a cooler. But experiencing the performance first hand, the price has proven cheap for this level of quality for an all-in-one cooling package. From the easy assembly to the epic included thermal paste and components, this is a very valuable cooler. The performance is superb. The build is sturdy and design is extremely efficient. The software has more functionality than I thought a CPU cooler could have. (I had no idea how inept my old CM cooler has become.) The fans CAN get loud- but they don't need to. This rad can easily keep a CPU under 70C with the fans well under 1300RPM..For the enthusiast or hobbyist alike, this cooler is worth every bit of its cost. However, just be aware of how large 280mm is (I know I wasn’t aware..). The H110i V2 is slightly smaller at 240mm, which would have fit my case perfectly.I will update my review if anything changes of if it randomly explodes and soaks my rig’s internals with coolant.** Software in Linux. This is only good for setting the fan RPM speeds or sensor LED color. I was able to get the software to work in Linux with Virtualbox hosting a Windows 7 VM. On the host machine, add the user to the 'vboxusers' group and then logout and back in. In the Virtualbox window: on the toolbar click Devices -> USB -> select ‘Corsair Memory, INC. Integrated USB Bridge [0200]’. This assigns the USB device exclusively to the VM, where Corsair’s software can detect/manage it directly. However, only the H110i’s temperatures register and not the CPU or other temps. So the nifty notification macros may not work unless your cooler itself is overheating (unlikely, since during testing mine remained around 21C while the 100% loaded CPU was up near 60C.)Though I use a “seamless mode” Windows 7 VM, I tried to install the software using Wine but it wouldn’t load (likely the OS-level driver install.)** On modding my case:Apparently I could have removed half of my hard drive bays to mount the radiator on the floor, but mine are all populated! I ended up removing my top case mesh, then using a dremel I widened the screw mounts to match the fans positions.The radiator sits on top of my case, with a dust filter layer and the fans on top of that.  I mounted the mesh on top of my fans, so the case looks mostly normal other than the mesh is elevated and resting on top of my fans. No wires, tubes or any other connection is visible and it all looks pretty clean. I went with a push arrangement for the fans.

They do become extremely quiet on lower RPM.  They seem to be standard DC brushless fans @ 12v 0.55A.I am not a fan of pre-applied thermal paste.  I personally prefer to use some MX-4, and I am sure some enthusiast out there would love to use coollaboratory liquid ultra. :P"," Corsair Link is necessary to get the best performance from your CPU cooler, but it is an additional piece of software you must install and you must use an internal USB header for the USB Corsair Link cable.It does have some nice features, but it isn't necessary to the operation of the CPU cooler.  If you don't do any crazy overclocking,  the motherboard fan control and default pump settings should be fine.I am really not sure what the difference between this cooler and the H110i GT is.  They look identical and have pretty much the same specifications.

The CPU is a Sandy Bridge i5-2500k at 4.8Ghz at 1.48v, which is almost at that chip's maximum vcore of 1.52v. I'm super impressed. I will say I did replace the unit's Thermaltake fans with Noctua iPPC-3000 PWM fans on one side, and another three Noctua NF-P12's on the top of the radiator in 'pull' configuration. The included Thermaltake fans are OK-looking, and I ended up using them in other systems I have running, so I can't comment on the stock fan performance if I had just been using those three, and not six Noctua fans instead. But the radiator and pump can handle it. I also am using an Akasa AK-CBFA06-30 FLEXA FP3S powered fan splitter for the PWM fans since the included Thermaltake fan splitter didn't work on my motherboard. The included Thermaltake fan splitter isn't powered, so all three fans are supposed to be driven off of the CPU PWM fan header. Maybe the Thermaltake included fans wouldn't draw enough current to overload that header, but the three Noctua iPPC-3000's did."," I didn't end up using the included fans, in part because my motherboard PWM CPU header didn't offer enough current to use them, so I had to use a Akasa AK-CBFA06-30 FLEXA FP3S powered PWM splitter and some Noctua fans instead."," Overall the product is excellent, and if you add some extra fans to the radiator in push/pull, you'll have stellar cooling performance from this AIO.

At 50% load and 4.2 GHz, my FX 8350 package temperature is only 30°C and the fans are still spinning at their lowest speed. It looks great and is pretty quiet despite adding three additional fans to my system. When running Deus Ex: Mankind Divided at 4K with most of the settings cranked, the fans were barely noticeable. It should be noted that I have a PWM controller but all my fan speeds are dependent on my CPU temperature, which is always kept low by this cooler. -Cooling potential allows for plenty of overclocking headroom. I managed to get 4.5GHz from my system without too much change in load temperatures thanks to the additional thermal mass and faster heat dissipation. -Hoses are a good length, allowing me to configure the radiator facing either direction while the water block still reaches the socket, albeit it's a close fit if I have the hoses in their farthest position from the CPU due to my memory bank cutting it close.-Includes a power splitter plus three adapter cables for your fans! I didn't need them but it's handy to have.-Size! This think is huge!", -Size! This thing is huge! Make sure it fits your case before buying. My NZXT H440 is roomy enough to accommodate this monstrosity without the case itself being too big.-The instructions are supposedly bad. I didn't even open them. Watch a tutorial instead. The installation itself is quite easy and fairly intuitive. -It feels like one of my hoses are longer than the other. It's probably nothing but it irks me a bit.-Fans seem to only be available in one color. They're quite good and my build is all black and white so this wasn't an issue for me.," I sort of wish that the water block had some fancy lighting effect like my old Deepcool Captain 120 or the new NZXT coolers. Regardless, they don't deliver the cooling potential this thing does so I don't really care.For such a powerful AIO cooling solution, it's a pretty good price. I highly recommend this product if you're an enthusiast.

Only pictures for instructions and a few parts are any bodies guess as to how they should be installed . The warranty papers are in ....NOT ENGLISH. The tubing from pump to radiator and back  is (pencil sized) I.D  about 1/2 the size that Corsair uses and easily crimped .

However, future builds will have much, much larger cases like the HPTX size. If I build a dual cpu system, I will have to find a way to bold and hang two of these radiators some where in the system after drilling through the side panel somewhere to run the hoses and cpu block. A little bit of a Ozark work around but should work well. I have not yet found cases that support this radiator block with 6 fans bolted on straight through without modding. Maybe one day I will. But not today.Many of you ask if the case or that case or some other case will fit this radiator.

The cables are wound and bound pretty tightly. The connectors are therefore loose. If you notice one of the fans aren't working out of the box, check these connectors to ensure they are engaging properly.

Speaking of the fans, if you're going for silent operation like myself, the stock fans are best left in the box. The pump itself is quite noisy. Turning the speed down mostly solved problem with no negative effects on performance.Finally, the unit is very plain. It comes with no software, and the block itself is just a boring circle, with no led's or anything."," This unit greatly surpassed my expectations as far as cooling goes.

I would highly recommend this cooler for anyone that is starting out and wants cool temps for a decent price. Here's some specs, I'm running a I7-4790K at 4.7 mhz the temps i get are around 25C idle and 72C at max load on Intel Burn Test on standard. For a 700mhz overclock with not the best thermal paste, I think that's pretty good for an aluminum rad AOI."," One of the things I didn't like about the cooler was the fans, I'm using a Fractal Design Arc Xl and the filters on it pretty much make the fans half as good as they should be, I switched them out with a part of Cooler Master Jetflo fans and a single NZXT FX120 fan. I keep them on mid power but they are still very quite.", For the 140 bucks spent i would say buy this if you have the space and the time to install it and make sure to read the manual install can be tricky if you don't know what you are doing.,3,5

Make sure your case can support it.  I am currently using the Corsair Obsidian 450D and even then it has invaded my drive cage.  The mounting for the water block could be better it took me about 5 times to finally figure out how to put it on and i have installed plenty of coolers in the past.,,3,17

You gotta really pay attention to the diameter.  Pro tip: Larger diameter == socket 2011.," Regarding the waterblock mounting hardware in the cons section, I found it easier to use my intuition and rotate the plastic mounting screw holders as-needed for the larger 2011 socket.   You _do_ want to pay attention to the diameter of the actual screws.  Removing them after-the-fact is less than ideal.After that, and what really matters, cooling performance is epic.  My 5960X is on the more 'poor' side wrt overclocking.  As such, I'm pretty topped out at 4.2 stable at the save 1.399 vcore.  Temps hover around 55-60C full tilt depending on ambient.

I was still not sure what to buy given the large sizes of some of the CPU coolers out there and the questionable performance.I stumbled on this unit and boy was I happy. The install was pretty darn easy. I say that compared to some of the stuff I have read from others reviews on other coolers. I was in and out in 20 minutes without a headache.My PC used to crash due to heat when running video processing programs like Corel Video Studio Pro. While running simple games like candy crush my temps would go to 60C.My case had 4 fans and the stock AMD CPU cooler.Now, with this cooler the temp never goes above 42C period, regardless of what I am doing. During non-load work like typing this review my temp is sitting at 32C and my room is at 26C!!! Even more impressive is that my tower is behind a door in my desk that only has the back open in a fairly small confined space designed to hide the tower. This thing rocks. I have never used a liquid cooler before and I hope it lasts for many years. I am now a believer. Don't waste your time researching traditional radiator fan combos. This is the solution for me!!!As far as refurb goes. The packaging looked like I pulled it off a shelf at a store. The only thing I could see was that there was a small chip in the paint on the radiator. No dent just a paint chip. Only gets a 4 out of 5 because I can hear it when it is working hard to cool.

N82E16835181043,35-181-043,7/24/2014 8:06:13 AM,Ian T.,Is this thing really refurbished?!,5," First off when I got this thing in the mail i wasn't expecting much. But I was very surprised to see that it looked brand new. The only way I could tell it was refurbished was a tiny corsair sticker stating this product comes with a one year refurbished warranty. Besides that it came in a packed and sealed box. Very impressed. Now moving on to the actual performance.   So originally i had a stock cpu fan for my intel i5-4670k which kept the idle temps around 46c-48c in ambient temperature. Its not bad but thats keeping the cpu at a stock 3.4ghz. So every time i over clocked of course the temps would sky rocket to 59C and then if under any load would get to close to 70C or above. Which for all you newbs out there is not nice for you poor cpu.    So I decided I wanted a closed loop water cooled system so i could push my 4670k to 4.2ghz and not kill the cpu with high temps. I didn't need anything fancy like the H80i, which has corsair link, and 2 fans for push pull and all that jazz since my mother board is a Asus Z-97 ROG which is freaking AWESOME. My board aready has AIsuit 3 which has all the monitoring software to control everything in my rig, ranging from total fan control to cpu temps. So a H80i would be a waste of money and redundant since it has the same style of software, Which i here sucks in the first place and doesnt work half the time.   So the reason I chose the H60 is it is exactly like the h80i minus corsair link and 1 fan. So when i put this thing in i was really surprised to find that this took my idle temps from 48C all the way down to 28C!!! It even dips down to 25C sometimes depending on the room temps and this is while its over clocked at 4.2ghz. And for 54.99 its a freaking steal... Just buy the darn thing.... Is really worth it....", It only gives you the option to do a pull with the one fan that come with it but that doesn't really matter. But i had a spare fan and just slapped that on and Im doing a push pull system. It just was a little deceptive on what it looked like on the box..., I have a mid tower Obsidean 450D corsair tower and it fits great. Definetley a great option for smaller cases.,None,None

They designed in house with a pump that is ceramic bearings that are rated at almost twice the life of other enclosed coolers.  The fans are really good quality. Comes with thermal paste on the block. Packaging was really good and solid.  Instructions were fairly clear and all the hardware for both Intel and AMD chips and really easy to install.

I had purchased the part mid November and discovered it had failed on 12/30/16. The leaking occurred after I booted up my PC to find no display showing up on my monitor. I thought this was strange and continued to reset my PC (dumb, I know). I eventually peered into my case and saw that a small pool of coolant had pooled onto my GTX GeForce 970 GPU. The leaking had occurred in the crease between where the top of the housing unit and the base were attached. I immediately took photos of the liquid cooler and the pool of coolant. RMA took longer then expected (total of 3 weeks), but I did receive full reimbursement for the cooling system as well as my fried GPU. The company is based in Bejing so there is a language barrier. They do their best to address all their emails daily, but if you don't call them daily to respond to your last email, it will not get addressed."," - This was a known issue for other users and I thought that leaking in water cooling systems are rare, and it couldn't happen to me. Unfortunately it did. For the peace of mind, I would steer clear of this product. It may look good, but buyer beware.- One positive is that DEEPCOOL do in fact stand by their product. They would rather reimburse you for the damages to cover up the flaws of their product as opposed to addressing issues with design and manufacturing.",3,3

Never had issues with closed-loop CPU coolers in the past.  Should have done more research even though there were not many reviews about the leaking back then.  Came home after work yesterday only to find out my PC wouldn't power on.  Opened up the case and noticed greenish droplets over my video card.  Took out my GTX 1080 and it was pretty soaked.  Some spillage also got onto my motherboard.  This CPU cooler was installed perfectly in my huge PC tower which sits underneath my desk away from the likelihood of getting bumped or even touched.  Nevertheless it leaked overnight and throughout the day.  The liquid looked to be coming out of where the hoses connect with the CPU block.  I installed them with a generous curve and it was by no means tight or pulling on anything to cause any extra pressure.Still have to see if it damaged my 1080 and/or the motherboard., *Believe the leaking reports!,2,2

The pump is almost completely silent, I had o check the RPMs in BIOS to be sure it was running, fans are excellent as well (from my tolerance)"," -There where a few ""minor"" factory and design issues. A few of the radiator fins where slightly bent in a few places and the plastic casing on the pump is a tough loose. A small section of the power headers wires where unsheathed close to where it enters the pump.-Mentioned in other reviews its slightly disappointing that the light on the pump light is not able to be controlled.", Now this is my first liquid cooling setup and I had a few reservations at the time.

Everything assembled without any issue,  and everything looked OK (visually) right out of the box.  Within five days, however, I wasn't getting any video signal after powering on my computer.  A quick look inside the case revealed a leak  coming from the clear J-bend in the pipe.  It happened to pool on top of my GPU, and upon closer inspection, seeped into the PCI slot on my motherboard. The GPU is definitely fried, and I'm also concerned the motherboard is damaged as well.  I wish I had read all the reviews here first. I likely would have avoided this particular model.

It's not shown in pictures, but apparently the lower end of the J-shaped pipe that joins to the side of the pump housing is a weak point in the system.  There is so much pressure in the system that it forces this joint out of its seal, and so a leak occurs.  I took pictures of the issue and contacted deepcool's customer service via email, received a response within two hours.  Note, this was in the late afternoon/ early evening and they are in Shanghai, so beginning of the business day there.  They apologized profusely, said they had never had an issue like this before, offered me a free replacement and upgrade to the 360EX, which I accepted.  NOTE:  Multiple reviews have listed this exact same leak problem.  I bought this because the reviews with problems listed really emphasized their amazing customer service, so I figured if I was unlucky enough to get a leaking unit, it would be an easy fix.First thing the next day, a new cooler was on the way, this was on thursday 12/8/16.  Yesterday, on tuesday 12/13/15, the new cooler arrived at my house.  It seems they have some sort of contract with a certain online retail giant, as the replacement came in their box (note, it has a smile on it, if that helps, apparent you can't say their name in a review).  Also undamaged.  When I opened the box, the first thing I noticed was moisture that had been sprayed around the interior of the box.  So, I inspected the pump housing and the EXACT same joint had leaked.  The system pressure causes coolant to SPRAY out of this leaking joint.I contacted deepcool support AGAIN, told them that I would not like another replacement, I would much prefer to just have my money refunded.  They offered either refund by paypal, or by online retail giant gift card balance, stating that some people who chose paypal refund were charged a fee of some sort.  I requested the gift card balance, and it was placed on my account the same day.

Last night I decided to boot up and play some games before I went to bed, and right away I heard a sound that was very similar to when you turn on a small water filter inside of an aquarium, or when you turn on a garden hose and pinch the end of it. This pump has a clear, see-through glass tube that protrudes out from the actual CPU heatsink and I was able to see air bubbles moving through that glass tube. I Looked down and saw that my $800 EVGA GTX1080 FTW graphics card was now covered in a massive puddle of cooling solution. I had my monitor turned on as well, and my PC did not even post. I shut my PC off immediately and used napkins to soak up the cooling solution on my card, but some of it was already stained onto the backplate and had made its way onto the chip. The cooling solution was continuing to drip out from the seal that connects the tubing to the glass tube that is fixated onto the CPU heatsink. I quickly removed my GPU from my motherboard at which point a small, but steady stream of cooling solution started to squirt out from that seal which landed onto my SSD's.Before tonight, I had had no problems with this cooler what-so-ever, and was very pleased with how cool it kept my CPU, but now I am left in serious doubt, disbelief as to how this could even happen. I cannot even begin to put into words how frustrated I am with this product. I had a Corsair H100i in my previous build that lasted me 4 years and was still going strong, but I sold that rig and recently saved up and upgraded all of my older components to newer ones. Now my PC is in ruins, and my $800 GPU is fried thanks to the absolute poor construction of this water cooler. I have taken pictures of this incident and the damage that it has caused and will be in contact with the companies HR team in hopes of resolving this matter and having my damaged components replaced.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS COOLER TO ANYONE.

N82E16835856078,35-856-078,11/13/2016 12:33:32 AM,Tung L.,Decent Cooling and easy set up,4," This liquid CPU cooler does what it's supposed to do, keep the CPU at cool temperatures.Glowing LED pump head.Keeps the temperatures around 25-35°C when in light use and around 36-50°C on moderate gaming lengths and levels for my Intel 5600K CPU."," As previous reviewers have stated, the hoses for this CPU are a bit stiff and hard to move around a lot to get the radiator and hoses into place. Wish there was more colors that could be added to the lighting of the Pump head."," I previously had a review that put this product at one egg due to it leaking near the J shaped pipe connection attached to the pump head. It got into my graphics card and fried it. I couldn't edit my previous review, so I had to delete that one and create a new one. Newegg should really give an option to edit reviews. Going on with my mishap, I immediately contacted Deepcool's customer support since I was severely upset. Their customer service went above and beyond on taking care of the replacement and also reimbursing for the fried graphics card in under a week times period. They do stand behind their products and wish to keep their customers happy. I have taken off one star due to the faulty sealing of the lower end of the  J shaped pipe. After I got my replacement, I was comparing the new one to the old one and noticed that they used a certain clear sealant near the bottom end of the J shaped pipe to keep the coolant in the close looped system. I would suggest for their design engineers to come up with a new sealant or way to keep the pipping in place. I am assuming due to the over use and temperature change, the sealant begins to deteriorate and the pipping begins to pop out due to high pressure, therefore, allowing the coolant to leak out. I'm wondering if the one I previously had was just from a bad batch as some other reviewers have yet to have any leakage. Just my two cents. Once again, A+ for Customer Support. Thank you Deepcool.",5,5

N82E16835856078,35-856-078,11/6/2016 6:10:07 PM,Anonymous,"Pretty good AIO liquid cooler, be careful of the hoses during install",4," Water block looks fantastic. The best thing about this cooler is easily the ‘reactor’ style waterblock, which is LED backlit red and has a little tube that you can see the coolant in. In my opinion most AIO liquid coolers look pretty bland, but being able to see the colored coolant makes this one pretty unique.Performance is pretty good, about what you expect for a 240mm radiator. Definitely keeps up with coolers that have been around for longer. I don’t have other coolers to benchmark this one against, but for reference, it has no problem keeping an i5-4690k cooled under 60-70 deg C under full load with a 4.6GHz overclock and 1.25V overvolt. For a bit of background, that CPU is being pushed fairly hard (nobody really goes over 1.3V). Also a note that Intel CPUs are limited by the crummy thermal paste they use under the heatspreader- I believe if I delid it that this cooler would be even more effective.Comes with a few nice accessories, including a 4-pin fan extension cable and a fan hub that lets you hook up four 4-pin fans to one motherboard header. However, if you do have enough motherboard headers I recommend you just hook up your fans directly, as you’ll be able to control speeds individually.All in all this is a pretty good value cooler and priced very competitively to boot."," As others have noted, the way the hoses attach to the waterblock limits the angle they can be moved. Most AIO waterblocks have the two hoses sitting side by side so that they can be flexed in a pretty large arc and point multiple directions from the waterblock. On this cooler, the hoses are stacked on top of each other which means the bottom hose is limited to pointing in pretty much one direction relative to the waterblock. And since the two hoses go to the same radiator, the top one is limited as well. It’s hard to describe but if you look carefully at the hoses coming out of the waterblock and imagine turning them it should make sense. As a result, you have to think a little carefully when orienting the cooler because it’s pretty easy to accidentally put a lot of stress on the hoses.The fans are a little bit on the loud side when turned up. Personally, for radiators, I prefer Corsair’s SP (static pressure) fans, which are built specifically for pulling air through restrictions like radiators or heatsinks. The fans in this cooler have many smaller blades while the SPs have fewer but bigger blades. Swapping those fans in should improve performance.Finally, not a big deal but it’d be cool if the coolant were clear and there were an RGB LED so that this cooler works with more color schemes. It would also be cool if the mounting brackets were painted black to match instead of silver.", I’ve been running this thing for about a week straight now and haven’t noticed any problems with leaks or any shoddy hose clamps or anything like that which could cause a leak. I suspect that the people who experienced leaks may have placed stress on the hoses by not being careful during installation. Unfortunately the way the hoses are designed (see above) make it very easy to accidentally stress them so I recommend flexing them a little after install to make sure they are not being pulled and have some freedom of movement.,None,None

I will be recommending DEEPCOOL in the future with only a minor caveat."," Once I installed the cooler I was happy with the results but within a month and a half it had sprung a leak and took out my graphics card.  The leak appeared where the red visualization tube entered the cpu block.  It was slow enough that it was not evident most of the time.  I had an additional complication in that the graphics card I used had a cover on the side where the drip landed and there were just a few holes in the cover ... one of which coincided exactly with where the drip landed.  I purchased a temporary replacement card locally that went out within 24 hours.  This time I saw the leak.I came back here to check the reviews and only saw one that reported a leak (FYI they purchased their system about the same time I did) and it had a response from DEEPCOOL to contact them.  I decided to contact them first prior to posting a review and am happy with the results.  I not only got a free upgrade but they paid for both replacement graphics cards.It seems there was a bad batch of cooling systems that were made but with the exceptional customer service I feel that they made it up to me.  As for the caveat I mentioned in the Pros section, and I would advise this with any liquid cooling system from now on, if at all possible position your tower in such a way that if a leak occurs it will drip out of the case instead of on any electronics, e.g. lay it elevated on its side.  This will allow you the benefits of liquid cooling (as mentioned above) while it failing safe if a problem arises.  It will be important to fix the problem quickly otherwise you can overheat your CPU but short of a catastrophic failure you might even be able to limp along with it (if the air stays in the radiator) until a replacement arrives.", Read the last paragraph in my Cons section for caveat explanation.,1,1

For the most part it the did the job just fine but would get a bit loud in the summer.  I have a 4790K which is running at the stock clock of 4.0 but it boosts to 4.4 under load.  I was able to get my vcore down to 1.15 from the stock setting of 1.2.  I live in the southeast and the summers are brutal.  My computer just happens to be in one of the hottest rooms in my house.  The ambient temperature in this room is 27C in the summer.  Under load with hyperthreading enabled the 100i would struggle somewhat.  The hottest core would spike around 75C while the average high across all 4 cores was 70C.  By comparison the Deepcool 240EX spiked at 67C and the average high is 65C.  The 240EX also stays very quiet compared to the 100i.  The fans are far superior to those offered by Corsair.", Not really a con but I noticed my temps were somewhat better when installing the mounting bars vertically instead of horizontally., My 100i was only $90 as a shell shocker 2 years ago.  I got the 240EX for only $76 last month when Deepcool products were discounted. It was a steal at $76 and well worth the current $90 pricetag.  The results have been great so far.

N82E16835856078,35-856-078,9/17/2016 8:50:06 AM,Anonymous,Fantastic for an overclocked Gaming Workstation Hexcore Processor.,5," This AiO cooler is really easy to install onto an Socket 2011 v3 motherboard. It comes with mounting pins that screw in to the CPU plate directly and they come with twist nuts that go ontop of the mounting rails. Very easy mounting design, it's fantastic. The socket is almost square so it can be installed rotated 90 Degrees to help accommodate placement. Though it is a tight fit, so be careful when sliding the mounting rails on to the mounting pins. The waterblock and socket mounting hardware is very well designed.The waterblock hose fittings rotate, which is really nice for trying to position the hoses, but they are stacked vertically which can cause them to get in the way of each other.The included fans are great, well designed for constant pressure, and they're fairly quiet. Other people have said they're loud, but I find them fairly quiet even at 100% fan speed. They're not noctua quiet, but they're still very nice, heavy and well designed fans.The coldplate is pure copper, and its mildly textured, which is great for thermal compound contact.It comes with extras to help mount and setup fans, including a sticky strip for mounting the fan hub.Vanity reasons, the appearance is great. It looks industrial rather than flashy, and fits very well with a subdued industrial theme. I personally prefer the industrial, almost muscle car like theme and this cooler fits that preference fantastically, despite the glowing LED breathing effect on the waterblock. It doesn't look tacky or gaudy, though the color choices make it hard to place with most builds. Red and Black with silver metal are my choice colors, and this cooler fits it perfectly.(Though this wasn't the reason I purchased this cooler.)This AiO took my i7 5820K Hexcore 4.2ghz 1.3volts overclocked CPU from 95C+Thermal throttling max on an aftermarket air cooler, down to a max stress test of 84C during prime 95.Maxium temp under full gaming recording workload of 74C.This cooler works absolutely fantastically, and I'm personally extremely happy with it. Price wise, its fantastic, performance wise it's incredibly good."," Deceptively bulky. The images and mounting placement make it look smaller than it actually is. The waterblock is bigger than it looks and the hoses are very stiff and do not swivel very far. The hoses are a hard to manipulate and can cause a lot of stress on the connections to the waterblock. Rotating the mounting hardware as said in the pros may help relieve some stress on the hose connectors.There is a small drain nob on the inner facing side of the radiator which can make mounting the radiator a real pain. I don't understand why Deepcool left the drain nob in that position, but its a really bad place for it.The center tube is made of thin glass, and feels rather fragile.The fan hub that it comes with for your radiator fans does not show RPM in the BIOS of my motherboard. Variable speed control still works but the RPM read out is blank, and there's no software to fix this.The cold plate comes pre thermal pasted, It's a thick pad of it, and I couldn't find any information on what material it is. I opted against using it, cleaning off the plate and using Arctic MX4 instead. This might not be a con for some but a clean surface would have been better. The distribution and texture of the prepasted material could just trap air bubbles, and it's better to use your own.Documentation is limited, and the install guide is simple."," If you have an R9 Fury X or any Liquid Cooled GPU setup, this will be very difficult to install. It was a bit of a nightmare to install both the Fury X, which has a 140mm Radiator, and the 240mmx120mm Radiator in this cooler.There's no way to install the waterblock without rotating it, and rotating it the wrong way can cause a lot of twisting and pressure on the hose fittings.I placed the Fury X radiator at the back of the case, and the CPU cooler radiator at the top of the case placing the radiator shifted forward, above the chassis top mount sandwiching the frame between the fans and radiator.Trying to mount the Radiator directly to the Frame without rotating the block put a lot of pressure on the waterblock hose fittings.DEEPCOOL should really find a better placement for the radiator cap, it's in a terrible position.",4,4

N82E16835856078,35-856-078,8/30/2016 3:06:17 AM,Nicholas B.,Love it,5," This is my first liquid cooled anything.  Obviously it's not a custom setup, but it does an awesome job keeping my CPU cool!  Some backstory:  I was running an aftermarket giant fan/heatsink on my AMD FX 8320.  After about 2 years the fan started sputtering...temps started getting up into 60+C under load, and I was getting random warning beeps all the time due to the climbing heat.  I did some searching around, saw the predecessor to this 240EX and it had good reviews, so I purchased this successor.  While I waited for the delivery I put the stock fan/heatsink on which dropped my temps down to 51C under load...still warm, but more manageable.  Well, after installing this cooler my temps under load have dropped drastically down to just 35C under a gaming heavy load, and between 29-30C while I type this.  Pros:- Pretty easy install- Does a great job cooling- Fans aren't atrociously loud"," - Hard to tell if the pump is working.  The reactor flashes red while in operation, but it's hard to tell liquid is moving as it's devoid of bubbles (As it should be).- The power cable for the pump uses a 3 pin connector, when all of my previous heatsinks/fans had a 4 pin connector which matched what my motherboard had for the CPU fan slot.  Wasn't a big deal as it turned out.  Plugged the 3 pin female connector from the pump into the 4 pin male connector on the motherboard, not using one of the pins of course, and it worked just fine."," If you want to do a push/pull setup with the radiator, make sure you have a case that has enough room.  The 240EX radiator+fans take up about 2 1/2 inches of head room in the case.  I recently picked up Thermaltake Core V71 Extreme Full Tower, and that case does have enough room to mount the radiator at the top of the case along with the radiator fans below it to push air out, and the stock 200mm case fan above the radiator to pull the air through.",2,2
N82E16835856078,35-856-078,8/24/2016 1:36:58 PM,Christopher L.,First Liquid Cool Setup,5," So this is my first written review for a product on newegg ever.  I ordered this and selected standard shipping, but it arrived the next day which was an unexpected surprise.  Idle temps on my 6600k are noticeably lower than my old cooler master 212, about 8 degrees immediately after install.  I'm sure this will continue to improve as the thermal paste sets.  Installation was a breeze once I decided where to mount the radiator."," Install directions could have been a bit more specific for a novice PC builder like myself, although if you are buying this product you probably already know what you're doing anyway.  I wasn't sure what fan configuration would be best or what case placement was optimal, but a quick google search settled things.", To anyone looking to make the jump to a liquid cooled setup I would definitely recommend this product.,3,3

Usually this price range you can't really find a decent 240 that actually feels like quality. -The visual glass tube and led are subtle and a sight to see in a commercial product. -Stock fans are TF120's, which are actually really good fans, great airflow. Actually prefer them over my usual SP120's.", My only con would be the loudness of the stock fans. At high RPM's they are audible but it's not really fan noise rather the airflow from the fans. Comparable to the SP120's., I would definitely recommend this to others. The price is very attractive and the cooling is phenomenal.

N82E16835856078,35-856-078,8/13/2016 2:38:57 PM,MATTHEW S.,Poor for intel boards,2," The captain 240EX is a slight improvement over the previous model.  The visual liquid flow and reactor style pump housing as in the previous model is fun to look at.  There is a major improvement in the hoses used in this model.  Mounting was simple, directions were clear and  the price was right. The mounting system is more rigid yet engineering behind it is flawed.  See the cons."," I can not focus too highly on the positives of this cooler when the major focus needs to be on the mounting system.  First 4 screws go through the backplate.  Then the backplate connects through the back of the motherboard with the first set of  nuts getting threaded all the way down finger tight against the motherboard.  Then there is this ugly metal bridge that goes from one screw to the next and more nuts that hold the metal bridge firmly in place.  In the center of each metal bridge there is the final threaded mounting holes where the cpu block is threaded into.  This mounting system is ugly for one, but because of the positioning of the hoses that come out of the cpu block I believe there is a major flaw.  This part is the most difficult to explain.  If you look at other models of cpu coolers the hoses come out of the cpu block upwards and are side by side, much like antennas off a router.  This allows you the ability to move both hoses flat in either direction against the surface its sitting on.  I would say this gives you a full 160degrees of flexibility.  I understand on other AIO coolers some hoses are stationary, please note I am only comparing to explain how the hoses interfere with the mounting system.  On the captain 240 the hoses are stacked on top of eachother and facing out one side.  Because the base of the hose is also improved you can not spin the hoses in either direction very far without either the motherboard or the other hose base becoming an obstruction.  I would say this gives you only 15 degrees of flexibility.  The problem here is that the lower hose base hits the top nut preventing the cpu cooler from being seated properly.  The upper hose will swivel but the lower hose just has no where to go.  Its pinched between the nut and the upper hose base."," The major draw of this cooler is the appearance of it.  I believe that if the reactor style pump housing had an option to stay on all the time it would be better.  I think that the mounting system draws away from its appearance and at this point the glass showing liquid flow just isn't enough to keep me interested in the looks.  For this reason I am removing an egg.   Readers should know that I watched some videos of this cooler mounting on AMD boards and it looks like the mounting issue I am having on them boards is not an issue.  The bridges are shorter and the hose base does not interfere by hitting the upper nuts.  However, on Intel boards buyer beware.  My suspicion of the mounting system not allowing the block to seat properly is backed by numbers.  Through all tests performed, one core, the same core temped dramatically higher than the others.  At one point there was a 10degree difference in temperature.  This is an improved model and I believe this is an oversight.  Perhaps why they are selling them so cheap?

I checked my temps after installing and my FX-830 (overclocked) was idling around 20-25C, way better than my H100i GTX which would have idle temps around 40C. After playing Battlefield 4 for about an hour (CPU and GPU intensive game), my temps never went above 60C. I let my PC cool down for a bit and ran a stress test on the CPU. At 100% load on the CPU, my temps never went above 62C. This cooler has an amazing performance and I honestly wouldn't want any other AIO in my PC. The design is beautiful, the fact that you can see the liquid without having to go all out and have a full custom loop is a huge plus, it is completely quiet (I can't hear the fans at all, even with the CPU at 100% load there has been no increase in noise from the fans), and a 99% tool-free installation is fantastic. I didn't have the previous generation of this product, but after looking at pictures and installation between the two, the 240 EX looks like a huge upgrade over the previous one; I love that the EX has rubber hoses now instead of plastic like the old 240, makes the build seem a lot sturdier."," No way to change the LED color/effect on the device itself. But that's not worth taking an egg off for, it still looks great."," Would definitely recommend this AIO to anyone looking for a new CPU cooler. Newegg always surprises me as usual.

It's the sound you hear when a dvd drive goes bad or can't read a disc but almost like clockwork every 5 seconds. It's obviously not a beep code so if you hear it then know that it means most likely this cooler's fan is rocking back and forth not cooling your cpu in the least. Luckily it gives you the option to add a 120mm fan for push pull cooling of the radiator. Always use that when cooling a radiator in case a fan fails. As of now the kuhler fan is limping and my back up is saving my cpu. Temps are ok with open window for now but I gotta send this thing in. When the computer starts up the fan will hit high rpm but then it just gives up and I have to spin it like a propeller to get it up to maybe 60RPM. 6 months in and it does this and it has a 3 year warranty!

Everything is prefilled, and it is pretty much plug and play. The hardest thing was mounting the fan and radiator. It has a bit of a strange screw layout. It did fit my fan mount with a bit of coercing, but it was not easy. I have installed this fan on another computer and it had the same problem. It does work, but I'd get some rubber o-rings and ditch the screws you get it the package for your own because you will be screwing it in VERY TIGHT! Compared to other prefilled liquid systems the hoses are very flexible. I managed to fit it in a midsize case with a GTX 660, which took quite a few zip ties to get some cables out of the way. It plugs in to the CPU fan connection on your motherboard, of course. You cannot vary the speeds of the fan directly on the unit, but you can from the BIOS screen by modifying the CPU fan speed. The LED temp indicator on the cold plate unit is a very nice touch. It is easy to monitor the approximate temp on my PC while overclocking or playing a graphic intensive game. The hottest it has ever gotten was while overclocking and running a large video game, but it still functioned fine. I'd blame the graphics card for a good chunk of the heat. There are some minor downsides, but all in all you get a very solid unit for the price you pay. I will definitely recommend this to any prospective PC builders in the future as a budget cooler."," Strange mounting configRuns a bit loud, but not too much of a nuisanceSomewhat difficult to put on CPU/motherboard mount. Takes your time when installing it!"," As with any liquid cooling system, take your time. I've installed quite a few and I always spend at least 45 min installing, connecting, and double checking the connections.

Often, when I come home, I see the red light glowing and the computer is non-responsive. After I hit the reset button and reboot, I see the CPU temp at 70+C. The chassis temp at ~30C.If I do anything at all on the computer, the CPU temp goes to 60's and sometimes 70's C within seconds. I can see it go up a degree every second or so. This is with the CPU at ~20%.

But, under full load (SEIT@Home), it might even perform worse than my old Peltier-based cooler.  That was disappointing.  Technology is better, overall, though, so I'm still glad I bought it.It's better because of the liquid coolant which uses a radiator that installs onto chassis external fans.  So, it doesn't torque the mainboard like other coolers types.  And, even better, it exhausts directly to the exterior and, if you want, you can install your own second 120mm fan.  You can easily improve cooling performance installing a high-flow pulling fan.  But, that's loud, and getting the model with a bigger radiator with the money.Also, it is difficult to attach cold plate (with screws) to CPU mount.  Of course, I expected it, but not in this particular way.  The mounting system uses removable nuts on the under-plate.  So, it's possible to dislodge the nut when trying to affix the cold plate.  It didn't happen, but I was worried it might and that made it extra difficult to install.Lastly, it did fail in an odd way.  The good news is that my CPU didn't burn up immediately.  It actually just stopped cooling well.  My system was overheating and eventually crashed, but it didn't permanently damage the CPU (AFAICT).  Antec seemed pretty cool about replacing it and advanced me the replacement, though I had to pay for a replacement and get a refund after I returned the old one.

Going in order Cons are as follows.1. Installation, Springs on screws too stiff. Had to manually compress with pliers just to get screws to start. Retainer ring mounts for screws do not line up completely with my AMD board. Took at least 30 minutes to install just to the CPU. 2. There is no way to control the fan speed. Fan Speed is completely controlled by firmware. This makes it so fan speed changes are slower than if they were done by motherboard as it has to sense the temperature increase within its own electronics. In this regard the older version of this cooler is better.3. Fan can never be replaced.4. Don't plan on overclocking with this cooler. With one step voltage change on my AMD 6300 Temps went above 55C. Fan takes too long to change it's speed to keep up.

I am around 35-45 degrees on each core now as opposed to 60-70 degrees with the Kuhler 620.Because this was an upgrade, I didn't have to mess around with the rear mounting bracket, which was quite a headache with my first install."," Rating was given entirely on performance because a difficult install is worth the advantage.  That being said...Even though this was my 3rd time installing a Kuhler series model, it was still a non-stop fight with my case, motherboard, and the cooling unit.  The fan casing is gigantic and I had to use the gap install piece because the radiator wouldn't fit flush against the back of my case (it is obnoxiously big).  This caused the fan/radiator to be hovering over the CPU area and made screwing in the bracket quite the chore.

With an Intel board and processor it gives you 3 holes that are practically in the same slot. The posts are not secured so as you go to screw them in you will push them out. Why can't they allow you to attache the retaining ring and back plate before the pump and heat plate. Seems like you should be able to snap it in if they attached it from the bottom instead of the top. But instead you have to install multiple spring loaded screws into non secured posts that are in tiny holes that are separated by the tiniest nubs of plastic., They should have had metal back plates made for each Intel socket or at least made 2 so that the holes could be separated and threaded so that your posts would stay put.

Able to run memory at 1866mhz with this cooler.  Just in case you don't know What a cooler processor has to do with running the memory faster. The faster the memory the more heat is produced from the processor since the memory controller Is in the processor thus cooler processor can effect memory speeds with out without the processor at default speeds One thing bother me the most . They packed a peace of foam into the fan blades to protect them during shipping, ok so the plastic fan blades were bent from the foam and this caused extra vibration and extra noise wile it was running.

Seems to cool nicely - hey, isn't that its job? The assembly kit has 2 sets of securing bolts for AMD so you if want to use your existing backing plate you can (no motherboard removal necessary if you had an older case with no cpu cutout)."," Nobody at Antec can tell you what the LED cpu head temperature colors mean. There is no information I have found. I can tell you, cold is white, warm is blue. After than -- it is a guess. Gee, shouldn't the company know? I think there is red but you would have to have a failure to see it.I was hoping for Orange and Green in the spectrum, but who knows.My biggest problem, the securing bolts have NO capture mechanism to the capture ring, so you try to hold the cooler head on the cpu (one hand) and start spring loaded screws one at a time (other hand) in the bottom of your case. It took me TOO LONG to get them on. Plus there is no STOP point for how much to tighten the bolts. Snug sounds good. Very technical, why I could be an engineer!!!The metal inserts of the backing plate were a challenge for the AMD set up. I had to make a poor man's press to push the inserts in (if you look at the inserts, they have a metal ring on the inserts which hold them in place in the plastic plate). Do it wrong, you have broken plastic -- then your goose is cooked.As always, the documentation could be WAY better -- a few extra words and the installation would be so much faster. Why an engineer could even do it !!!  Maybe.I feel the design is very aesthetic, but because both ends of the radiator have tubes leaving the radiator, there needs to be equal clearance on both ends of the radiator. My case had issues with needing 1+ inch clearance on each end. I had to put a slim fan on the top of my case (15mm) near the radiator tubes to clear one end of the radiator."," Many little things generated my 3 eggs. If the radiator was not so quiet and sexy looking, I would have given it 2 eggs. It could have been a 4 egger with a little design improvements. I am confused about the Pre-Fab design effort on hardware. Did anyone at Antec try to put this together is more than one case?

Water block mount ring is easy to fit. Integrated Y-cable for pump and fan is nice for those lacking fan sockets. Included airduct could be useful to some.

When I said loose I mean as I try to install the waterblock and screw in the longer ones on the other side, the nuts flew off. I tried it over and over until I felt frustrated, took the motherboard off the case, and redo it on a table. Cost me 3 hours to put everything back in place.The bulk of fan and radiator was not any better either, it is bulky and always gets in the way of installing itself or the waterblock.There is no replacement for the fan as well.

That choice was easy, one call to newegg and the RMA was all set.Even baring the problems that prevented final instillation the Kuhler H20 650 and I would guess the 1250 are not easy to install. You have to fight the radiator while trying to hold the cooling plate in place as you try to get screws aligned to secure to mother board. The back plate that allows the cooling plate to attach to the mother board is not well thought out either. The grommets that the screws use to secure the cooler in place fall out of their slots easily. I do believe that once installed this product would have worked as well as advertised.",1,2

Obviously, this would be a problem if it weren't but it's reassuring.- Comes with thermal paste already applied, so just ""plug and play"" if you will- supporting fans power cables can link up close to the cooler itself, centralizing cabling and making it easier to manage cables- fan speeds and other info seems easy to find out through a direct USB connection to the motherboard.  At least, that is what I noticed when I ran my POST and got into my BIOS.  They seem adjustable too, which is nice.- got this for a good price with a $10 rebate"," Where do I begin...long story but I'll try to make it short.  Before I do, disclaimer: I'm not perfect with my hands and this was my first CPU water cooler that I bought.  I cannot recommend this model for a new builder like myself...So I went to mount the backplate for this model.  It's plastic, which makes sense, given the transistors/electric current on the mobo.  I have an older case (HAF 912 - don't recommend it for this or any CPU water cooler but I digreess).  Took me a bit to get in but I did get it mounted on the back and tightened up the mobo.  Now, all I needed to do was to put in the standoffs, hook on the CPU cooler itself, attach the thumbscrews and go.  You would think this would be easy, but because the cable is so stiff and heavy, it's extremely difficult.  The cpu cooler comes with a plastic cover protecting the cooler/paste but it is flimsy and can come off easily, so while you are trying to mount it, it's quite challening as you are trying to fit it on, to not touch the cpu/paste to anything and screw the thumbscrews in.  It's really a two person job because there is so much that can go wrong and I recommend anyone have a buddy there to help for that reason.So me, holding the cooler in place, put the thumbscrews on quickly.  With some, they went on easy, the others, not so.  You can imagine how hard this is to do with one hand while holding the CPU cooler in place.  Once I thought they were all on, I tightend them, using a screwdriver.  Bad idea I learned, because some weren't on properly when I tried to tighten the cooler nicely and I overtightened and snapped one section of the mount on the back.  I tried to ahead with the cooler, as it seemed mounted but I could tell it was not a perfect fit.  In my BIOS, I physically pushed on the cooler and it would drop 10 degrees.  I kept going just to see but within 5 minutes, my CPU (Intel core i5 6600 k) was near 70 at stock speeds, so I shut it down and went to try again.Of course, the snapped section of the mount in the back made it impossible to unscrew the mount.  I had an issue with another mount as well (I could not seem to untighten it - maybe I wrecked the threading?).  I tried using pliers, but nearly took out a voltage regulator on the board and since I couldn't get the mount off, I couldn't get the mobo out of my case.At that point, I knew it was beyond me so I took it to a shop to get the two mounts off (which  were badly scored).  I'm out $50 because of that but in a sense, a big learning curve for myself (and I hope others) without a computer, and am now waiting for replacement parts to arrive.My advice: ensure you have a large case (measure and plan), do not over tighten the mounting screws, and test each standing mount you plan on using with the thumbscrews (8 mounts were supplied, 4 a dark gray, 4 a solid black, appear identical - why?).  MAKE SURE they will go on easily and perfectly with the thumbscrews.  These should mount easily and perfectly without any question or difficulties!  However, I only have two that seem to work now.  I may have been too gung ho with using the screwdriver, but given the function of these thumbscrews and the difficulty in mounting this, they NEED to work perfectly with these mounts!  There is no exception to this!  I'd rather pay an extra $3 to ensure these are perfect.  Obviously, they were not!  If they don't mount perfectly, don't waste your time and don't risk it like I did.If you are capable in building things, have done this before, are patient, and know your stuff, you should be fine but this was much more difficult to do compared to say a Hyper Evo 212, which I've installed and used without issues.- Lastly, note that the radiator is bigger than 120 mm and quite thick.  You'll have trouble fitting this anywhere but the back of a mid-tower case and I've now had to Frankenstein my rig by putting my 200 mm fan on the outside of the top of the case instead of inside and just underneath it.  Not such a big deal if you know that going in but it takes up a lot of space: be warned!  I bought it thinking it wouldn't be that bad (no room for a 240 mm rad in this dino rig) but now I know.- Bring a bud when installing this, you'll thank me later!"," So now, I'm stuck with a computer without a cooler waiting for Corsair to get back to me and hopefully send me some new parts to complete my build!  I figured that the least they can do is to send another mount, standoffs, and thumbscrews and I have hope that they shall, given my frustration, wasted time, repair bill, and downtime.  Oh, good luck trying to find these parts anywhere else except their store BTW (I know, I tried).What really frustrates me is that I emailed them on Saturday morning and I still haven't heard from them (8:30 PM Monday night).  I know they say 2 business days (and that this is Christmas time) but I'm out a cooler and therefore a computer.  Why on EARTH don't they have tech support working on weekends?  It might seem like I'm impatient, but problems happen 24-7!  I know mail doesn't  usually get done on weekends but it blows my mind that a company this big can't have a few people working on weekends.  If they had, maybe my replacement parts would be in the mail right now but as it is, I'll be lucky to get them by Friday at best!  That's a long time to wait for something that should have worked and been built properly.I have corsair air fans that have worked wonderfully, and I know that this cpu will deliver as promised, once installed, but I have to say, this has been quite the ordeal and learning curve.  I will consider other brands in the future based on this experience at this point.  I may update my review once Corsair gets back to me...- Also read on other forums that getting it to sit flush with the CPU can be an issue with some mobos.  A cheap and effective solution is to use rubber washers and it's something I'll consider if necc. but for now, I'd just like the backplate so I can a) either try again myself or b) take it to the shop, pay them and grit my teeth, and have them assemble it for me.- DOUBLE CHECK your measurements and think carefully before you pull the trigger.  You might see this on sale and it might work perfectly but it's not worth the stress/money to save a few bucks if it does not fit for you (and that goes for anything for that matter).  Keep that in mind...",1,8

The only problem that I ran into was that when I installed it the first time it was not fully seated on the processor. I was getting temps idling in the mid 50c range which would jump rather quickly with any load. After taking it all apart and doing exactly what i thought i had done the first time I was able to get it fully seated on the cpu and the temps dropped drastically. With the fan on quiet and the pump also on quiet I am getting temps in the 38c range idle and with minimal load it jumps to about 42c. This is with a i7 2600k and a relative room temp of 70-75f.  Load temp running prime 95 on all cores it tends to top out around 58c with the restrictions sill on quiet. Removing those restrictions on corsair link it will drop the temps another 5-8c. It works significantly better than my other heatsink worked which was just your average tower aftermarket one.," Really my only issue with it was that i had difficulty getting it to seat properly, and I've probably hit triple digits for the number of heatsinks I've installed at this point in my life.

I fit this pretty easily in my NZXT Noctis and kept my Core i7 4790k running very cool. Comparing it to the Corsair H100i I had on that CPU I found this stumpier, but thicker, radiator to be very competitive with it. Bear in mind, my H100i had 4 fans in push/pull while this H80i v2 is using only two fans in push pull.Another plus for this is that while it is much thicker than the H100i, it is shorter (naturally) so, if your case can't fit a 240mm Radiator but you want comparable cooling, this thick radiator does the trick.I've always been a fan of Corsairs software for their ""i"" series of coolers and it's just as effective here. It's great seeing the information of your system with a simple program. It has become a lot more stable as of late.I like that the tubes come from the top of the block, as opposed to the side like some other water coolers. It can help with clearance issues on some motherboards with regards to RAM.I found this to be a pretty quiet water cooling set up. I set the fans on high and it never got annoyingly loud for me."," It's big and thick, might be hard to fit in some cases.The stiff tubing may make it difficult to install, but once it's set it runs beautifully.

That one uses metal screw holes which kind of float inside the plastic back plate.

I don't know if this is a bug with Corsair's software or Aida64 but I also confirmed this issue occurs with a Corsair GTX H110i as well. *******PLEASE IGNORE bad review********Performance was terrible as it caused my CPU to overheat and thermal throttle...considering it was worse than a Corsair Hydro H70 which has a smaller radiator and smaller hoses. Here are some benchmark results of its cooling performance versus the Corsair Hydro H70:Crosair Hydro H80i v2 (2 Fans)•	Idle Average:	85.5 °F•	Load Average: 	206+ °F to overheating/throttling and BSOD•	Ambient: 	70.0 °FCorsair Hydro H70 (2 Fans)•	Idle Average:	85 °F•	Load Average:	194 °F•	Ambient: 	70.0 °FDue to this awful performance, I tried and failed with many tweaks/changes in order to remedy this issue and all are listed below:•	Set the profile, fans and pump to performance mode•	Verified the pump was working by checking Corsair link which reported it was around ~90% •	Triple checked that the water block was mounted correctly and tightly•	Tried Noctua NF12 fans instead of the included Corsairs ones•	Tried using different thermal compound •	Tried lowering the overclock on my CPU to 4.7 GHz with less voltage •	Tried placing the radiator outside my case for better ambient airflowIt seems that it may not have enough coolant in it and as a result the coolant is getting out of the radiator before its actually been cooled. So I took it out of my case and moved it in a way that would cause the coolant to go from the pump to the radiator and vice versa and the water moving back and forth was very loud like there wasn’t enough in there. My Corsair Hydro H70 did not replicate this same sound/effect. The function to change the RGB LED on the water block when the CPU gets hot didn’t work at all as it stayed the same color despite the CPU getting so hot it was thermal throttling. The hoses were very hard to maneuver if you have a smaller case as the braiding on the hoses makes them very strong to prevent kinking but does hinder mobility.", Overall I was expecting way better cooling performance from this AIO than my current one and was shocked that it performance worse than a smaller and older AIO.

All fittings are on point and all metal construction around the radiator, including the radiator, the fins, down to the copper header/coldplate all appear to be well machined. The quality is what I expect from a brand that prides itself on its reputation to the gaming community.The pump section/housing has a nice angular design that compliments (especially the neutral color schemes) the current popular aesthetic (think founders edition GTX cards for example) It looks good, with a nicely illuminated Corsair logo. A note about the logo, if you don’t like it being on you can load up Link, Corsairs proprietary software and change its illumination, on or off, and its color.The H80i V2 comes with twin SP120 fans, however these are uniquely different from the other SP120’s they sell separately. At least according to the breakdown of specifications I take right from Corsairs website.  The two included SP120 fans appear to differ slightly by a few decibels (35 vs 37.8) and cubic feet per/minute (CFM) 62.74 vs 70.69. While other 120mm fans would suffice (specifications matter, not just any 120mm fans) the included models appear to be the slightly more efficient.If you are looking to cut back on some fan noise, while it’s under load, consider possibly not going push-pull configuration. Just because there is a second fan for this setup, it’s (in my opinion) not necessary and causes an obstructing bulky setup, on an already generously sized rad. The push-pull setup will maybe get you a few more degrees, but at the cost of noise, and the previously mentioned obstruction it will cause.The previously mentioned LINK offers a lot of basic control with an intuitive layout and monitoring/control options. I'd like to something implemented similar to NZXT's CAM software. This is a great looking, well functioning, AIO cooler option. From looks, to performance it’s a winner with mild setbacks."," Accommodating the size of this 120mm rad can be problematic. It would be a unique desire to need it for me, having experience with both the H55 and other 120s such as the Kraken x41, I like my smaller rad choices to be just that, smaller. Understanding the concept of a greater depth for cooling aside, it’s more of a personal strike, and I don’t feel it should reflect against the product."," I have had no issue with sound from the pump. I find it to be exceptionally quiet. People having noise issues may be unique cases, the input seems to vary wildly across the board from quiet to loud. Always refer to the guide for proper installation, mounting all fans properly to prevent vibrations and/or whines, make sure if you push-pull, that the fans are facing the correct direction etc.i5 6600 - 21 idle and I have not witnessed it above 46 during other tasks, gaming, or rendering video (which is largely GPU dependent anyways). Nice and cool, and as I would expect. For at $100 price range, Its a nice rad, with the fans being the hero of the unit to keep it plenty cool. If you swap to something aftermarket for cooling, always be sure and check specifications on the fans. I have messed with different fans in the past (using a 290x as a control) and not all 'radiator certified' fans end up passing the test.",2,2
N82E16835181102,35-181-102,8/5/2016 3:13:04 AM,Anonymous,Really good performance out of a compact solution,5," Cooling wise this thing is pretty good for a 120mm AIO... Shaved 33° C off my R9 290X in combination with the HG10 A1(best hybrid bracket for 290/290X). Which is saying alot because I ran this card's fan at 80% with reference cooler. I never seen my card exceed 57° C under this and it only got that high while mining altcoins for multiple days straight. While gaming I never seen it go above 46° C.Also recently running this on a i5 3570k overclocked to 4.5Ghz and during stress tests it got pretty hot but gaming I haven't seen it go over 63° C. I'm O.K. with that number because it's a pretty demanding OC with only an AIO cooler on a chip that runs stock at 3.4GhzOverall, I'm extremely happy with this purchase and I bought it went it was still $109.99. If I had the case I have now I probably would have opted for a 240mm variant but if you need good cooling in a tight space then this is it.The corsair link software(Have to have pump hooked into USB header) is really nice, if you have the radiator fans hooked into the pump's headers you can control the speed on those and you can also control the speed of the pump", After using this for a while none really. The only things I can even think of that could be improved on but definitely not deal breakers are:*Pump noise is pretty audible on performance mode*Stock fans get insanely loud when spinning at max rpm's but I just switched them with static pressure Noctua's.," RGB LED is pretty cool, you can match it to any color theme you may have in your case using the corsair link. The thing about the RGB LED's though is that the colors are really light, so it can be rather hard to get exactly the color you want.",1,1

N82E16835181102,35-181-102,8/3/2016 2:36:09 PM,Matthew H.,Fantastic Cooling For I7 6800k,5," + Quiet at idle and when configured correctly for load - My previous CPU cooler was a Zalman CNPS12X which is somewhat average in terms of noise level (while being a pretty good air cooler).  This H80i V2 cooler, at idle, is noticeably quieter.  With default settings my CPU (i7 6800k) sits at ~30-35C and the fans at ~1200.  Later on I customized the settings which now keep the fans even quieter at idle at ~800 RPM.+ Looks great - This is my first closed loop water cooling solution and I love the simplicity of it.  Granted, the water block and associated fans are about as big as a substantial air cooler - but being attached to the back of the case seems to open up the case a bit more, or at the very least makes the case appear more organized.  The LED illuminated Corsair logo is also a nice touch, in addition to the fact that you can customize the color of the LED.+ Corsair Link Software interface - I particularly like the temperature monitoring interface with drag-and-drop indicators that can be placed over a side-open image of a PC.  You can even import a custom image, like an image of your actual PC.  It makes it very easy to monitor temperatures and fan/pump RPM at a glance.  Normally if I see something like 'MB Fan #2' I probably won't remember which fan that is.  But with this interface I can drop that indicator onto the physical location of the image where the component is actually physically located, which makes it very easy to keep track of things.  Not to mention you can also just rename the sensor to whatever you want.  This also helps if there is a noisy fan in your case - by watching the interface I have been able to isolate which fan RPM's are associated with which sounds.  And the interface doesn't only monitor the H80iV2, it also tracks the rest of the temperature/fan RPM monitors that it detects within the PC, including GPU fan/temp, motherboard temp, case fans, etc...+ Adjustable fan/pump speed - Fan speed adjustments can be tuned to the finest detail.  There are multiple pre-loaded profiles like 'Quiet', and 'Performance', in addition to a few others, but 'Custom' is what I settled on which allowed me to adjust fan speeds to match my system needs.  In each of these profiles the fan will react to changing temperatures within whichever temperature sensor you select.  Pump speed only has two settings, 'Quiet' and 'Performance', and there's not much in the way of control over those options.  If you select 'Quiet' the pump will run at a continuous ~1900 RPM, and if you select 'Performance' it will run at a continuous ~2900 RPM.  There's no way I can find to make the pump speed react to higher temperatures, but that doesn't seem to be necessary either (read other thoughts for more details).+ Swivel hoses - The hoses don't swivel at the CPU end but they do at the radiator, which is basically the only thing that makes the hoses remotely manageable as they are fairly stiff."," - Fans are VERY loud above 1800RPM - The fans become clearly audible as they approach 1800 RPM and become the loudest fans I've ever heard in a PC when they reach their maximum RPM of around 2700.  I'm not totally sure if it's the fans themselves that are loud or if it has something to do with airflow acoustics of the radiator.  Either way I'll probably be experimenting with some aftermarket fans if I ever need that higher air flow.  Fortunately I'm able to use lower RPM settings for my needs so this hasn't been a problem for me (read other thoughts for more details).- VERY stiff hoses - Contorting the hoses in a way that suits your layout isn't much of an option here.  They will lay the way that they will and there's not a lot that can be done to reorient them.  The side panel of my large full-tower case is a bit difficult to close now with these hoses pushing up against it.  The radiator half features swivel hose connections which helps a bit, but the hoses are still a challenge.- Covers rear RAM slots - My case is a Lian Li PC-V2010B (old-school but still great!) and with both of these fans sandwiching the ""extra thick"" radiator between them the cooler sticks pretty far into the case, pretty much right up to the CPU.  This means that if your motherboard utilizes rear RAM modules, like many DDR4 systems, then those modules will be nestled snugly underneath the cooler.  I'm using low profile Corsair LPX modules and there is ~1 inch between the tops of the modules and the side of the radiator that is nearest to them.  Granted, 1 inch is probably plenty of clearance to fit even the most audacious of RAM heat-sinks, but I'm more concerned about airflow.  My modules only run at 2666 so they just get a little warm under load.  If you are running higher voltages/frequencies then heat might be more of an issue if your modules are suffocated under this thing.  Not currently a problem for me, but might be worth knowing for someone else."," Originally the fan noise above 1800RPM was a big problem for me as my PC would begin to howl when playing pretty much any game.  However, I discovered that the stock ""QUIET"" setting brings the fans up to ~2000 RPM when my CPU is at just 40C.  That was actually keeping the CPU from ever getting above 40C while heavy gaming, which is actually fairly impressive - but also completely unnecessary.  The 6800k, like most CPU's, is completely stable at significantly higher temperatures.  So I created a custom profile which introduces a much more subtle curve to the fan/temp ratio.  I keep the RPM at 25% (the lowest selectable speed) all the way up to 35C and then there's a gradual climb where the fan would theoretically reach 100% at 85C.  While gaming with these settings the CPU seems to stabilize at ~50C with the fan hovering at ~1500RPM.  This noise level is MUCH more acceptable and is actually quieter than my GPU fan.And while the fan speed can be a problem at higher RPM, the pump is VERY quiet even at its highest setting.  I can hear a difference if I put my ear next to it in the PC case, but otherwise it's basically inaudible.  In terms of performance range of the pump, I haven't found any reason to use the higher setting.  My temperatures stay basically the same on both pump settings (perhaps 1C cooler on the high setting) so I'm left to assume that the radiator and fans are the limitation of this particular design.  If I ever overclock this CPU then I might retest the pump settings to see if higher thermal demands make the higher settings worth using, but for now I'll save the wear and tear on the pump and keep it low.While installing the cooler the instructions directed me to install the radiator before installing the water block.  I opted to do it the other way around.  With the hoses being so stiff the water block was difficult to lower onto the CPU while keeping it straight.  I really didn't want to end up with the water block applying uneven pressure to the CPU so I decided it might be best to make sure it was installed correctly before securing the radiator.  I'm not sure if there is a reason that Corsair decided on that particular order for their instructions but that's one small change that helped me out with the installation.  Otherwise the installation was breeze.  Socket 2011v3 requires nothing besides the stock pre-installed mounting bracket so this installation was probably the easiest aftermarket cooler installation I've ever experienced. (other sockets will require more work)Overall I'm very pleased with this cooling solution.  I debated about whether or not a closed loop 120mm radiator would be enough for a 140 watt CPU but it is clearly more than enough.  I'm convinced that this cooler gives my 6800k enough cooling headroom that I could overclock if I decide to do so (the 6800k isn't a great overclocker, but that's besides the point).  I would gladly recommend this product.",1,1
N82E16835181102,35-181-102,8/1/2016 7:17:44 AM,Daniel C.,Love this thing,5," I've been around the block a few times with closed loop coolers, and many times with Corsair's units from way back when, and I can say that they have improved a ton since the last time I used one. This thing has a much quieter pump than I had expected and it was super easy to install. Max temps under full load with an i7-980X were around 38c using Handbrake during video encoding, which is one of the best temperature ranges I've seen on my build when using 120mm fan coolers. The tubes were also a bit more flexible than one of my older models, even though it was still stiff and difficult to wrangle in tight spaces, but it was still easy enough to install on my motherboard. Mounting to the back of the case was simple as well, and the option of using this radiator in a push/pull fan layout is super handy. The Corsair link software is very useful and nice to have on the desktop for temperature monitoring, plus the waterblock can change colors to match the case. Being able to software control fan profiles is a must at this point, and having a CPU profile I can adjust on the fly makes life a lot easier."," Stock fans are a bit loud, but they're not the worst I've used with a product. I'd definitely replace them with better quality fans, but you can get away with the included fans without much of a worry. The tubing can still be a pain to wrangle into tight cases.",,0,1
N82E16835181102,35-181-102,7/30/2016 3:33:04 AM,Matthew M.,Excellent Near Silent Performance at Stock.,5," • Nearly silent cooling performance under ""Quiet"" mode. Pump is VERY quiet, hums quieter than a HDD spinning. Fans push a good amount of air in quiet mode, too. Chances are good that your graphics card's fans will be louder than this when set to quiet mode.• Very well designed, looks wonderful installed. Tubes are sleeved and very robust. Tubes don't come out the side so you don't have to worry about memory slots getting in the way.• Very easy installation and highly compatible.• 10C cooler under stress testing than my 6 pipe air cooler and only a touch louder never getting hotter than 58C for me.• Tubing is just long enough for most to be able to position this cooler anywhere they want including the front of the case, but just don't bet on it making it to the front for all cases.• Corsair software is well done, almost making it worth plugging in the USB header cable.• Very well packaged, No concerns about damage or shifting during shipping.• Corsair customer service still remains among the best. Fast responses, good RMA processing (I didn't have to RMA this cooler, though), and this cooler has a 5 year warranty putting it above the standard but below the highest of 6 years that NZXT provides."," • Anything above ""Quiet"" mode is audible and probably too loud for most people. When set to max the fans are easily among the loudest I ever heard. Balanced mode may be quiet enough for some, but still very audible.• Not the best solution if you want to have this to overclock your CPU while not having a loud fan whoosh.• Some may not like the idea of using the USB cable to use Corsair's software to adjust the cooler's RGB lighting and fan control, but it's entirely optional."," Overall, I view this cooler as being meant for stock CPU performance or light overclocks for people that want near silence and board compatibility without worrying about the heatsink hitting memory modules or other heatsinks on the motherboard. For that purpose this cooler excels very well and is indeed nearly silent, including the pump.However, if you're looking for a solution that will overclock well and remain quiet I don't think this cooler will be enough. If you don't care about sound then this cooler still performs well enough to hit most modest overclocks without getting too hot but there are definitely better solutions.Some also might not like how stiff the tubing is but I think that's a bit non-nonsensical. If you make the tubing too flexible you're far more prone to leaks with these AIO coolers, so it's either leak risk or stiffer tubing. I'll take large, stiff tubing any day. As it stands, you can maneuver the tubing well enough if and it's able to handle tighter spacing just fine.Bottom line, if you're looking for something that beats huge air coolers and you want near silent performance at stock or light overclocks; you definitely can't go wrong with this cooler.",None,None

So if you have a mid size chassis, if you need to muscle it in, you don't have to worry much about breaking it before you get a chance to fire it up.- The threading is pretty solid, and you will need to exert a little bit of pressure to fasten it to the case / fans to the radiator.- The pump itself uses RGB leds that allow for almost any color you would ever want.

(Not a huge deal, but could be a deal breaker for someone.)"," - I'd recommend using some Corsair Air Series AF120 LED 120mm Quiet Edition High Airflow Fans (LED fans) they look fantastic on it and have decent CFM.- You need to be very careful when tightening down the radiator to the case. DO NOT OVER-TIGHTEN! Doing so can strip the threads inside the radiator which will not grab the screw anymore.- I own a Corsair H100i v2 already, and this one is a 'smaller' model by comparison in terms of the radiator.  But it actually performs very close in terms of numbers to its bigger brother!  I'm really impressed.- Since corsair has multiple products in their H--- line, the model you buy should be largely based on how much space you have in your tower (to make sure it will fit ideally) and whether or not you may need to drill holes to mount it or not (to some this could easily be an annoyance, a little homework goes a long way!)",1,2

First, let me tell you about performance. With the 212 I had my 4690K overclocked to 4.3 GHz at 1.250 V and my idle temps were 30-35 while under load it was 80. With this puppy I upped the OC to 4.6, idle temps are 27-28 and doesn't go past 60. Don't be fooled by the bigger rads H100i coolers. Those have longer rads but the H80i has a thicker one and so the difference comes to a couple of degrees so you're paying a lot more for not a lot of gains. I had read a lot of reviews about the stiff hoses that were difficult to maneuver in cases. I didn't find that to be the case. I mounted mine to the top of the case (Enthoo Pro M) near the front in push/pull and there is no undue stress at all. Noise wise, the pump is virtually silent even at full speed. The fans on the other hand...oh my goodness. At their highest setting the fans are incredibly loud. There is no sugar coating it. Fortunately, the pump is efficient enough that I leave the setting in Corsair Link as ""quiet"" and up the pump's output and I get the temps mentioned above with zero noise. I do plan on upgrading the fans to SP120s in the future so if you are getting this cooler seriously consider quieter fans. As for Corsair Link, it's very useful but I hate the USB cable that has to run along your motherboard. I managed to squeeze in between heat sinks and components to make it less dangly and luckily it's not very visible against my black mobo but still...absolutely hate it.

I sent it back again for RMA and Corsair sent this new H80iV2 Unit!This H80iV2 is a little beast!It’s basically silent on medium or lower speeds. I have to try to hear the pump or the fans over my HDDs. On high it is the loudest component in my system, that’s over an Nvidia reference 970gtx with the blower style cooler. So yeah, the fans can get pretty loud. I personally don't think I will use it on that setting ever unless I decide to try some Crazy overclocking at some point down the road. Right now I’m at stock clocks on my 4790k at 1.11vCore. 100% load running full turbo at 4.4GHz for a few hours, core temp never went higher than 64c (Ambient room temp 69f) and the pump and fan noise remained very respectable.Mounting hardware is dead simple to understand and use. The only issue you might run into to, the hose stiffness. I had to try a few different orientations before I found something that felt ""safe"" in my 200R case. What I mean by that is the hose stiffness is so ridged that you may feel like there is too much leverage or tension being put on the fittings that join the hose to the radiator and pump. The hose is designed like this to prevent kinking, which is obviously a bad thing. You don't want that to happen! So it’s understandable why Corsair went this route. To make a ""one size fits all Computers"" cooling unit and still have something that performs well with a tiny pump, you need low hydraulic resistance. So the hose inner diameter needs to be as big as you can get it. The only problem with bigger hose is it kinks more easily with the tight bends you see inside a typical PC case. So I think Corsair did a good job finding a happy medium here. Personally I would like slightly less ridge hose but that’s me.I found that mounting both fans to the radiator was basically not necessary. I was only seeing about 2c difference in temps and the added bulk/noise just isn't worth it in my opinion, especially inside my small 200R. So what I did was use one fan on the radiator in a pull configuration, exhausting out of the case. I used the 2nd fan in the front of the case to blow cool air on my 970gtx. The headers on my motherboard (Gigabyte GA-Z97X-UD5H) seem to cause the fans that came with this unit to make a clicking noise regardless of being plugged into a 3pin or 4pin (PWM) header. Plugging the two fans into the splitter that comes out of the pump fixed this issue, even though I am not using the Corsair software.If you are looking for an aftermarket cooler that performs awesome, is quiet, easy to install and affordable. Then this Unit is something you should seriously consider!",2,2

N82E16835181102,35-181-102,4/2/2016 9:40:59 AM,Michael P.,Excellent All In One Solution For Limited Space,4," These products are usually pretty plain, black and gray, fitting with the vast majority of cases on the market.  The latest generations add some additional metallic styling to dress things up a bit.  The inclusion of red/blue inserts and programmable LEDs to color match whatever theme your rig may have is a nice way to dress things up, as well.  But let's be honest, no one is buying an all in one (AIO) CPU cooler for panache.What they are buying this product for, that it does very well, is CPU cooling beyond air cooling options without the hassle, cost, and risk of full open water loops.  It cools very well.  The high static pressure fans are well suited for forcing air through the thick radiator that seems to perform very well for a 120mm solution.  (See cons section below for fan noise discussion.)  If you're space constrained and cannot fit a larger length (e.g. 240mm) radiator, the thickness of this one at 48mm will compensate well, just be sure you have the space in your case for it.  The coldplate and pump seem to work as well as ever and the screws that mount the plate to the rest of the assembly appear to have improved quality over previous generations ensuring the screws are recessed from the plate surface so as not to disrupt contact with the CPU heatspreader.  Speaking of heatspreader coldplate contact, let's talk briefly about the thermal interface material (TIM) that comes pre-applied.  Thickness of TIM application is always a bone of contention amongst enthusiasts seeking to create optimal performance.  Corsair pre-applies the TIM and don't muck about with it.  Mount it, set it, and forget it.  If you ever have to remove the cooler to swap out CPUs, change boards, etc., the so be it, clean it up, and replace it with your preferred choice.  But for initial installation, go with what's there as it's tough to beat their application.  That's the hardware, rock solid stuff, build to last, and out of the box ready to go with no fuss.  I didn't get into the mounting brackets, etc., because their stuff is pretty straight forward, easy to install, and without issues.  It's my understanding for Skylake they updated the design with the GTX version to make it more compatible, but otherwise, expect zero issues there.On to software.  I'm always on the fence about software.  I feel the tools included are helpful for setting preferences and that's it.  (See cons for additional discussion.)  That said, the customization is pretty robust if you can understand the UI.  It takes a little getting accustomed to but I create a performance curve I like, set it, and then forget it.  My goal is strike the balance between regular gaming and benchmarking which have very different CPU loads with a dramatic ramp up in speed as full CPU load is reached.  I find that the tools afford me that flexibility.  Once set, however, I shut down the tools.In short, it has all the performance and features I desire at a good price point.  I can't really ask for much more and highly recommend this solution if you're looking to upgrade from air cooling but not get into the hassles of custom open water loops."," So, the fans offer fairly high static pressure, which is a good thing for forcing air between radiator fins.  The problem, however, is that results in high fan noise.  The Corsair H80i v2 is no exception here.  If you're militantly opposed to fan noise, this will be an issue for you.  I wear headphones so it's not an issue for me.  But just be aware, the tradeoff for high static pressure is noise.  Also, remember, this is different from airflow.  You can have high airflow that is fairly quiet by comparison.  In addition, some note observing pump whine at highest speeds, but I was unable to observe this, at least over the fan noise itself.  My only other con is related to the software.  As noted above, it allows me to do what I want, set custom performance curves that balance my cooling needs during gaming loads vs benchmarking loads with one curve.  So, I can run reasonably quiet and efficient while gaming and max things out under full CPU load on the same settings.  While this is great, the UI is lacking in simplicity and isn't very intuitive.  They should make some revisions to simplify the setup for ease of understanding and consistency of presentation.  Finally, I'm not a fan of having software monitoring tools on enthusiast performance parts.  So, I set it all, and save system resources by disconnecting the LINK and shutting down the software once I have things set how I like them.  Also, the LINK cable is just another wire that gets in the way of clean aesthetics.  Again, not a real big gripe, but something to note.That said, those are my only notable cons."," I've been using Corsair's all in one (AIO) coolers for a long time going all the way back to 1st generation H80s, H100s, etc.  Their ease of use closed-loop systems makes water cooling a CPU a breeze compared to the effort requires for building and maintaining your own water loop(s).  With that in mind, this product plays to the enthusiast looking for a great cooling option beyond air without hassle or significant expense.  I've tried all sorts of products short of fully investing in a custom open water loop and I always come back to Corsair's products.",2,2

So be aware of the thicker radiator. It may be a problem.," All testing was done at Quite settings and only one pull fan. I'm using a Thermaltake Urban S31 Snow Edition case with dual intake Thermaltake Riing 120mm fans on top and a single Riing fan for intake on the front. I figure, as the point of water cooled system is to obtain as much silence as possible, if it handles everything at Silent then at full bore it should be able to handle over clocks with no problem. To simulate full load I used 4 instances of CPU Burn In on my i5-6600k to max out all 4 cores and ran for 5 minutes each. I ran this test a 4 times and the results were consistent. I also waited a full week before testing to give the pre-applied thermal paste time to cure and settle.Corsair H60Idle - 23c   Package - 27cActive Use - 27c   Package - 30cLoad - 51c   Package 51cCorsair H80i V2Idle - 24c    Package - 30cActive Use - 28c  Package - 34cLoad - 50c   Package - 48cIdle performance with a single fan on the quiet setting was a bit underwhelming, pretty much on par with the older H60. However, once you push it you can see how much more efficient the new pump and radiator actually are. Keep in mind that my older H60 did not come with the Corsair Link USB cable and thus I was never able to adjust fan speeds. So they were at 100% all day everyday. So for the H80i to keep up with the H60 running at 100% proves to me that it is def a step up. I can only imagine the improvement by adding the second fan & using a higher fan speed profile. Or perhaps upgrading to higher quality radiator fans for additional performance. Overall I am very impressed with this cooler. Absolutely give it a look!",2,3

Keeps my  4770K clocked @ 4.7GHz.Under artificial maximum load, temps never exceed 90°C using the quiet profile.Under artificial maximum load, temps never exceed 81°C using the performance profile.Under normal use load, temps never exceed 85°C using the quiet profile.It mounts easily with no fuss. Much easier than some of Corsair's previous designs.The product looks elegant and refined.The radiator is quite thick and so are the hoses that run to it.It's got 2 fans in push/pull configuration, both PWM, both controlled by the device itself, which I like as opposed to static speed fans or having to be dependent on something else to control fan speeds.The pump/block top lights up. The color of lighting is configurable. The i in the product name denotes intelligent and can connect via USB or to a Corsair Link Hub. You can monitor the device through the use of the Corsair Link software."," I'm not a big fan of the Corsair Link software. When I used it, it would frequently peg out one of my CPU cores to 100%. The only solution was to restart my computer and then the issue would disappear for some time, or to turn off the Corsair Link software altogether. At time of this writing I noticed that there is an update to the software. Perhaps it fixes the issue. I don't know as I don't have time to test.The software is how you configure the devices to main settings, which is Profile and LED color. The LED you can set to any color. The profile's choices are Performance, Balanced and Quiet. I ran on Quiet the entire time as I don't see the point of all this elaborate setup if for nothing else than trying to be quiet. Performance is just too loud. Balanced is quieter, but still noticeable. I hate having to run and extra USB cable to my motherboard just so I can control the profile and color. I like to try and keep the cables neat and tidy and the USB cable comes off the bottom of the pump and forces you to run it across the motherboard. I was able to route mine to the top of the PCI mounts and around to sort of make it less noticeable. Still I'd give up color choice and be happy with a jumper to set the profile on the device itself if it meant avoiding using the USB cable and Link Software."," Before this I had an H110 on my CPU. I used PWM fans on it controlled by the motherboard itself with a fan profile based on CPU temp. It was very quiet. However the fans would speed up based on the CPU temp, not the liquid temp. So despite the cooler easily being able to keep the CPU cool, when the CPU would get a load and ramp up it's temp, the fans would immediately spin up. So it wasn't ideal.When I got this, I moved my H110 to my Titan X using Corsair's HG10 N980 mounting bracket (which it seems they only made like 12 of them or something). Just as a side note, the HG10 N980 wasn't a great experience and despite the end result being satisfactory, the install was a bit of a pain. But I digress.I was hoping with the extra thick radiator using push/pull that it would be a match for the 280mm radiator of the H110. It keeps the same overclock. But the temps are a bit higher, which I could care less.Here's the one thing overall that made me take off a star and that's because of the CPU bug in the Link Software I mostly had it off and because of that I think it might have been using the Balanced profile or something, because if I'd be gaming for a long time, eventually the fans would speed up and become noticeable. And maybe because the Titan X was dumping heat into the case combined helped further the issue, I don't know. My whole thing is quiet and sometimes it wasn't.Now if I can get the updated Link Software and it doesn't have the CPU bug, and I can live with the USB cable routed across my board and I can keep the Quiet profile engaged then it's probably not a big deal.Overall though it's still a great product. It's hard to go wrong with any Corsair AIO liquid cooler. They look and perform nice.",None,None

The build quality is superb; the hoses are thick and solid giving the feeling that a leak is not likely. The pump is silent, looks good, and gets the job done. The radiator is a monster, and even though it is held in place by tiny screws it does not flex or bend.Installation was easy enough with well written documentation. The system I am testing with runs a low end Celeron G1820 and was in need of a new cooling solution. The environment it runs in requires silence and the stock fan was starting to wear out. Originally the CPU and motherboard were housed in a MicroITX case; I had planned out a way to rig up the case to accept the behemoth cooler, sadly the hefty hoses would not bend enough to clear the PSU. So in order to properly test the cooler I moved everything into a Cooler Master Storm Trooper. It made me laugh to see the MicroITX motherboard be dwarfed behind the radiator.I installed the cooler using a single fan in a pull configuration. This was to decrease the possible amount of noise the system produces, and to make it easier to clean the radiator down the road. The only benefit I would get from installing the fans in a push pull config would be more pressure to push through the very thick radiator. Considering I am running a dual core Celeron I figured the radiator by itself may be enough to keep things cool so one fan would suffice.My idle temps were in line with room temperature and would drop down to ~25c. Under load I could not get it to jump above ~43c, with an average of ~35c while multitasking. Running three instances of burnP6, listening to Pandora, and writing this review the CPU maintained it's cool and there was no noise coming from the cooler in between songs. The LED lighting is subtle and acceptable."," All my cons revolve around the solid construction. The hoses are extremely thick and unyielding, just as they should be for the volume of fluid it moves. All in all, I am very pleased.The only real con is that it does not look like they support Debian (Ubuntu / Linux Mint) or RHEL OS for their controller software. But considering I have no desire to change the colors I'm OK with it."," Corsair has done a great job with this cooler, very pleased to be running it.",None,None

That cooler, similar to this one, had two fans, but it is considerably quieter than this one. Part of the reason is because of the terrible cooling performance this cooler is exhibiting. The old Phanteks cooler could keep the CPU below 35C regardless of room temperature with the fans barely running. I initially configured the Corsair cooler to keep the fans at 25% unless temps reached 45C, because at idle it shouldn't reach this temperature ever, but it does. The CPU never goes below 40C now, and frequently hits 45C causing the fans to speed up and generating more noise. That is absolutely horrible.At full load, temps are slightly lower than they were with the Phanteks cooler. The corsair cooler hits at around 78C with my i7-3770K clocked at 4.4 GHz, while the Phanteks cooler often hit 80C or 81C. This is an improvement in the temps, but the noise the cooler puts out at full load is horrible too, and I basically have to wear a gaming headset in order to hear the game over the cooler at times. It is just that bad. With the advantage of water cooling, there is no reason this should be happening. I speculate that it is because of the thermal paste that Corsair uses on this cooler, but I can't be for sure as I am out of the Phanteks thermal paste. Either way, a $50 air cooler shouldn't even be in the same league as a $100+ water cooler. It is possible that there is something defective with the model I received, but as is, I would not recommend this to anyone for any purpose.",0,2

I am pretty impressed with that as this is an excellent gaming combination and can generate some heat unless cooled properly in a serious overclock. The test build has stayed cool and quiet for almost a month with no hiccups or abnormalities, and has been a rock solid platform.Overall I am pretty impressed with the H80i V2, as it is definitely quieter than the previous version, and does seem to cool better.

I do have an issue with a USB header having to be used up, and lack of some needed screws to properly install things, but overall, this is a pretty fair water cooling unit.I would give it a 4.4 out of 5 eggs, but keeping even numbers, a solid 4 egg rating.

N82E16835181102,35-181-102,2/18/2016 12:14:45 PM,Mark W.,Be patient!,4," The H80i v2 came nicely packaged with everything you need for installation. I was replacing a Phanteks PH TC14 PE with 2 140mm fans. This was the biggest baddest air cooler available when I built this 2011 rig. Once installed, I couldn't believe how quiet the H80i v2 is. I almost thought I had botched the installation somewhere. On Balanced setting it is really hard to hear. I had to remove 3 140mm fans to install this. I figured the 2 120mm fans would be louder. Wrong. I checked the CPU temp on idle prior to the install and it was 39 degrees C. After installation I checked the temps for the H80i v2 and it is 34 degrees C. The light on the pump looks cool too. This is a quality product by Corsair, a quality manufacturer. This is a very solid unit and you might want to pick one up today. You won't be sorry."," The Quick Start Guide is rubbish. Corsair has tried to give instructions in 6 different languages so they give a mini paragraph on each step. If I was a first time builder, I would be confused. I have built over 50 computers since back in the days of MS/DOS. This is the first time for a closed loop liquid cooler. I found the unit clumsy and difficult to work with. I really could have used a second pair of hands to get the job done. Yes, the tubing is really stiff, but I figure it has to be to assure integrity against leaking. All the screws and fasteners worked as they should. When I was installing the fans, it took a magnifying glass to make sure I was installing them in the desired push/pull configuration. As I was getting ready to install the second fan I looked and figured out that the pump wouldn't have clearance after the fan was installed. This is where experience comes in. Sure enough, if I had installed the 2nd fan first there wouldn't have been enough clearance. I installed the pump first and then the 2nd fan and I was good to go. You need to pause at the completion of every step to see if you have a clear path to the next teeny weeney paragraph. I can install any air cooler in less than an hour. It took me 3 hours to install the H80i v2. Be patient and you will be rewarded."," Once I finally got the H80i v2 installed I thought I had botched the installation. It is so darn quiet. It keeps my rig 5 degrees cooler than the monster air cooler it replaced. I don't know why some people knock the Corsair Link software. It is informative and I can adjust fan speeds for what I'm doing. If I'm gaming, I use the performance setting. If I'm surfing the net or doing emails, I use the quiet setting. Foe everything thing the balanced setting works for me. Now that I have this monster installed, would I buy one for my son? You bet I would. I'd help him install it too. Get one. You won't be sorry.

Assembly and one-person installation is a walk-in-the-park with all the included hardware Corsair includes.Shipped via Fed Ex from near Indianapolis to Kansas City, in very cold temperatures - and no leaking has been noticed. But then it sat at room temp for a day before being assembled and powered on. Seems like it's some top shelf gear. Ask me 6 years from now."," The very nice woven tubes from the radiator to the cpu pump are ridiculously long. The Corsair Link software is goofy and not user friendly and as such I don't pay much attention to it after playing with it for 45 minutes. As it stands now, it's almost a waste of an on-board USB2.0 port. Maybe a future firmware upgrade/download will make it usable.This model goes on sale a lot and I paid about $10 more for it than I sometimes see it available for."," I'm still running a 1st generation Corsair H70, 120mm push/pull on an AMD Phenom II x4 970...nearly 24x7x365 since Feb 2011.This unit is installed at top rear of a CM 690 II Advanced as the exhaust push/pull, taming a 6700K aboard an Asus Sabertooth Z170 Mark 1.

N82E16835181102,35-181-102,2/15/2016 9:51:17 PM,Peter L.,"Nice, but some issues with fan noise level and hose length/stiffness.",3," Keeps my i7-4790K adequately cool at stock clock speeds.Looks great with the new braided cloth covered hoses.Corsair Link is much improved over earlier versions and can also set alerts eg. turn the waterblock LED color red (or color of choice) if your CPU goes above a defined temperature or perform an action eg. set fans to 100%, shut down your PC, run a program, etc..Reasonably easy to install, especially the waterblock."," The stock fans are too loud, in my opinion. On Quiet mode, there is a slight, but annoying whine, and Performance mode has this plus wind noise. Balanced mode is best in my setup as the whine disappears at the cost of an increase in wind noise. Between each mode there is only about 2 degrees difference in temperature at full load.Overclocking my 4790K to 4.5GHz or even 4.6GHz, using the ""Easy overclock"" function on my Gigabyte Z97 Gaming G1 mobo, and using Cinebench (rather than the more stressful Prime95) to run the cores at 100%, CPU temperature went up to 90C even with Performance mode set in Corsair Link. This is probably because the vCore is set a little high with the Gigabyte utility at around 1.35V, but I prefer my CPU remain under 80 degrees, which the H80i can handle easily at stock speeds (4.0GHz with 4.4GHz Turbo).The hoses look great, but are too long to install the radiator easily in the recommended position at the rear, and are quite stiff. In my Fractal Define R4 case, and with my Gigabyte Z97 Gaming G1 motherboard, one hose pushes on my top video card since the top video card slot is the first PCI-e slot (as it supports 4-way SLI). Most boards have a PCI-e x1 slot in this position, so this may be less of a problem for others.The backplate is made of plastic, and despite careful installation using only finger tightening, I think one of the threads may have been stripped when I installed (I was trying to say ""scr*wed"", but that is censored) the retaining bolts.Once the ""Alert"" level is reached in Corsair Link, if you have set fans to 100% and/or LED color to red etc., they remain at that setting even if the temperature drops below that level. Or at least, I have not found a way to reset them without a reboot."," I have mixed feelings about this cooler and Corsair's recommendations regarding installation. They suggest orienting the fans as intake fans, which would pull cooler air from outside and help lower CPU temperature.  This would raise temperatures inside the case and not help my aircooled ASUS DirectCu II SLI GTX 670s at all. A single GPU may fare better.The hoses are of a length which would make mounting at the case front easier, but Corsair suggests to mount at the rear, which would also reverse typical airflow direction if you mount the fans as intake fans, plus you would need to add a dust filter.On the other hand, this could be a great cooler for a mini-itx build in a case where you don't have room for a 240mm radiator. I am using a Corsair H100i in my primary rig (with an i7-6700K), and replaced its stock fans with Corsair SP120 (Quiet Edition), which greatly improved the noise level and still outperforms the H80i despite much lower fan speeds. A similar substitution could help with the H80i V2, at some cost of course, plus higher temperatures.Final thoughts: If you have room for a 240mm AIO cooler I would go for that option.Otherwise, if you can mount this cooler where noise will be minimized (i.e. not at the rear) and the hose length is not a problem, then this performs adequately with a rather hot running CPU such as my i7-4790K and likely a lot better with an i5 or lower clocked CPU. It could also be a hot contender (poor phrasing, sorry) for an aftermarket GPU watercooling solution for reference video cards.Note: The Corsair H80i V2 was provided to me by Newegg for the purposes of this review. I like Corsair products in general, with Corsair Dominator RAM in the rig I used for testing, and Corsair Quiet Edition fans in my main rig and their original H100i AIO cooler. My fair opinion is that I would give it 3.5 Eggs if possible, but with the noise level of the stock fans and my personal issues with the hose length and stiffness, I am rounding it down to three rather than up to four Eggs.",None,None
N82E16835181102,35-181-102,2/15/2016 11:50:07 AM,Nicholas T.,Excellent cooler system,5," Keeps my computer running cool nearly silent when idle. I replaced a traditional air cooling system with this cooler and both my noise levels and CPU temperatures dropped considerably, especially at idle. I'm running the cooler on the quiet profile and it really is quiet. It does get quite a bit louder under load or on the balanced or performance profiles, but it's still quieter than my old air cooler. The included fans are really quality fans, much quieter than the other case fans I have running.Installation was pretty straightforward. Since my case has removable sideplates on both sides I didn't even have to take my motherboard out. It was definitely easier to mount than my previous aftermarket air cooler, using a simple bracket on the back with four large screws on the front. I was expecting a tougher install to go to water cooling but it wasn't bad at all.Thermal paste is already applied to the coldplate and the two 120mm fans are very quiet at lower speeds.The Corsair Link software is actually quite good, which was a pleasant surprise. The software allows you to change the LED color or turn them off, and set up warning triggers that can automatically take specified actions at certain temperature thresholds.It does look quite cool as well, which is a definite bonus if you have a windowed case. Build quality of everything included - fans, brackets, screws, radiator, coldplate, tubes - is excellent."," You do need a spare USB 2.0 header on your motherboard to use the included Corsair Link software, which is necessary in order to set up fan/radiator profiles to control the RPMs in relation to the current temperatures. The system loses a lot of its functionality if you do not have a spare USB 2.0 header so make sure you have one empty, can free one up, or plan on buying a USB header expander."," I did not have a spare USB 2.0 header as my motherboard only has 2 - both in use - so I had to come up with a different solution. Luckily, each USB header on your motherboard is a set of two USB signals, and my case was only using 3 of the 4 total signals between the two headers, so I was able to pop 4 the wires out of Corsair's USB connector and insert them into an empty row on my existing connector. This worked perfectly. If you don't have a spare connector or don't have any room on your existing headers, plan on buying a ~$20 adapter to add more.",None,None
N82E16835181102,35-181-102,2/14/2016 3:42:54 PM,Michael L.,Improved cooling with CORSAIR Corsair Hydro Series H80i V2,5," The design of the Corsair H80i V2 is aesthetically appealing. The materials are of good quality and the finish was scratch free. Installation was relatively simple and one only needs to read the quick install guide. The backplate and screws do not fully tighten against the motherboard, leaving this a little loose with all four screws tightened. There was a bit less play when the motherboard was installed in the case, but this does not impact the installation. Thermal interface material is preapplied with the proper amount, so install on the CPU was simple. The radiator sandwiches the two fans, which I installed in a blowing out of the case fashion, after removing a 120 mm fan. I could have gained slight CPU cooling performance, but at the expense of higher case temperature for the other components. The tubing is not overly stiff and bent into position without too much effort. Connected the cables to a CPU_FAN header and the Corsair Link data cable to a USB connection on the motherboard and it was ready to boot. The Corsair Link dashboard software was an easy download and install. A default white LED logo was visible on the block, the color can be adjusted to the desired color with the Link software and this makes it easy to match motherboard or case color scheme. The H80i V2 replaced one of the most commonly used aftermarket air cooling HSF on the 1150 platform. The cpu was an Intel i7-4770k, which was temperature limited on overclocking and I didn’t have a particularly good overclocking chip. On air cooling, I typically ran it at 4.2 GHz and hit maximum temps of 74C, but I could overclock to 4.4 GHz (at 1.30 V) that resulted in max temps near 85C. Using the Corsair H80i, at 4.2 GHz max temps were 59C and at 4.4 GHz max temps were 77C. It was 15C cooler at 4.2 GHz and 8C cooler at 4.4 GHz, which is a respectable cooling performance increase. These were obtained using the balanced setting. Noise is quite acceptable, the fans are rated near 38 dB(A) and I do not hear the pump outside the case. Using one fan it would be even quieter. The Corsair Link software provides good temperature readings of the CPU and other sensors (e.g. motherboard, drives, etc.) and pump flow rate. The logging feature is handy to monitor maximum temperatures during stress testing, encoding, or gaming. Overall this is a quality all in one water cooling setup that performs well enough to get an easy 200 MHz additional overclock with minimal effort."," The LED is not as bright as motherboard LEDs, so it is difficult to color match."," The i7-4770k has some cooling limitations with the stock thermal compound inside the heat spreader, so I expect other more efficient cooling CPUs to scale even better.",None,None

I thought it was pretty quiet, and my CPU never rose above 70C - even when I was stress testing it with Prime95, or doing some more complex calculations in Matlab. I didn't think anything short of a custom water loop was really going to beat it, and I didn't want to have to deal with that. I especially did not think the H80i V2 was going to really compete with it, let alone outperform it. But so far, it is no only quieter on the 'moderate' setting (compared to the moderate setting on the H100), its 'moderate' cooling beats the H100's 'performance' setting. I also don't have to reach inside of my case to change the setting anymore, I can pull up Corsair Link and do it with a couple mouse clicks.Hardware-wise, this is a pretty solid unit. Corsair has finally started shipping quality fans with their AIOs. Most fans that are included with coolers tend to be super cheap, I don't pay them any mind. But I decided to give these a try since I felt I needed to as a part of my review. Normally, I would have put my Cougars or Noctuas on there, but I am glad I didn't. These fans might actually be the quietest computer fans I've ever used. I had to double check that they were spinning at all. When it came time for the install, I have my radiator mounted vertically, hanging from the top of the case as an intake. I know this works against convection, but I have a dust-filter there, and it was the same way I had the H100 mounted. The CPU bracket did give me pause though. When you screw in the standoffs, there is actually a lot of play - the bracket and move back and forth through the mounting holes. I suspect this is the maximize board and Intel/AMD compatibility, but it still made me nervous. I considered using the H100's mounting bracket, since that fit tightly and the mounting hardware for the H100 is compatible with the H80i V2, but decided that Corsair's engineers tested their product and had made informed decisions. So I trusted the H80i V2 bracket as-is, and everything mounted down, nice and tight.For reference, the gap between the H100 bracket and standoff is 2.3mm, the gap for the H80i V2 bracket is 3.6mmNow, the tubing looks like it has a nice, large diameter, but this is a little deceiving. The diameter of the tubing on the H80i V2 is 15.96mm (compared to 7.45mm  on the H100), but the connector from the tubing to the radiator is just 9.96mm. A pretty significant restriction. Now, this might have been to induce turbulence in the flow, and encourage mixing as it entered the reservoir of the radiator, and assuming the pump was sized appropriately, that tubing diameter is more for show and to minimize drag on the fluid.It is nice to see that Corsair Link is finally functional, and doesn't need to be babied along. You pull it up, and you can see all your system temperatures and fan RPMs, even ones that aren't specifically a piece of Corsair hardware. The software GUI does need work though. It feels like it was designed for XP or Vista. Not a very clean interface, and the background is distracting. It is things like the font being fuzzy - like they used a raster instead of a vector font - and the way the drop-down menus generate inconsistent interfaces. But I am being picky. The software finally does what it claims to do, the way it looks and behaves doesn't mater as much.In fact, the only thing that doesn't seem to be working for me is the LED. Supposedly I should be able to change the color of the LED through Corsair Link, but I can't seem to find the setting. Not a huge deal, but right now, Corsair doesn't have much on the Link system on their web page, so I am probably going to have to email support to get this resolved.All-in-all, this is completely worth the upgrade. I wasn't expecting it to be noticeably better than the H100, and I was pleasantly surprised.",None,None

Love the dual fan, push-pull configuration.  Builders pay attention to the fine print Corsair recommendation to mount the unit pulling air IN, opposite to conventional rear fan mounting, but it makes perfect sense considering those radiator fins need cool air not pre-warmed case air. Some reviewers mentioned fan noise, but my finished build was so quiet that I had to look to see if it was on . . . my house furnace blower makes more noise!"," Anyone geek enough to want a liquid cooler is probably savvy enough to install one; however, the included directions are slightly worse than basic, e.g., some of the drawings are actually misleading.  The total setup, once installed, is big, so do some advance planning . . . some contra thinking to the way you might ordinarily assemble a PC, e.g., look at what will be blocked on your motherboard AFTER it is installed, and where possible, try to get to those items first, or at least while installing the cooler.  The assembled unit is 4” thick, jutting out quite a ways over your motherboard, in my case an already somewhat smaller ATX motherboard, an LGA 1151 ASUS Z170-P D3.Worse still, no matter what position I tried for the Pump Unit (CPU cooling block) it was “wrong”, e.g., it was so close to my inserted memory DIMMS that I ultimately had to forego using the included USB data link cable, i.e., it was too tight to fit and turning the cooling block to any other position either severely kinked the hoses or jammed the power cable connections against my DIMMs.   Corsair is quite understandably proud of that nifty lighted top surface of the cooling block, but it might be time to consider a redesign based upon these newer, smaller motherboards."," Despite my seemingly lengthy list of “Cons”, they are mostly intended as helpful hints for future buyers/installers, and there is absolutely nothing serious enough to remove even one egg.

Running this H80i in performance mode, I noticed about a 5-8°C drop in temperatures over the air cooler when running Prime95. It was only when I put the H80i into quiet mode that I noticed the real advantage over the air cooler: noise. With the fans on the slow setting, even under load this is a very quiet cooler.The new extra plastic bits on the radiator and redesigned block really make this cooler look better in a case. The RGB lighting on the block is subtle, but nice. On the subject of the block, the pump is amazingly quiet. After a couple of hours of running to bleed the loop, the pump is almost inaudible even on the high speed setting. The pump and both fans are powered off a single 3-pin header which means fewer cables to try and manage. As with all Corsair Hydro Series products, this cooler has a 5 year warranty. On the software side of things, the new Corsair Link (version 4) is a nice improvement over the previous versions. It installs easily, the interface is easy to use, it gives plenty of control, and has the capability to monitor components across the entire system.On the negative side of things, the tubing, while really nice looking and feeling, is a bit difficult to bend and convince to cooperate. The included fans can be rather loud at maximum power, but they do move significant amounts of air, and will most likely never even reach half power. My biggest complaint, however, is one that is common across all coolers: installation. If installing this unit in the standard exhaust position next to the motherboard I/O, the radiator and fan assembly will cover two of the screws that hold the block. Also, it is always a pain wrestling the tubes into a decent position while trying to mount either a radiator or a block. That being said, the one thing that could have made installation easier was labelled hardware; it was not easy to figure out which block standoffs to use.Overall, this is a very good AIO cooler. The price is a little high in my opinion being only a little bit less than the H100i, and the performance of these units compared to a good air cooler is only marginally better. However, these are still strong units capable of cooling just about anything you put under them, and they're backed by a good 5 year warranty.",None,None
N82E16835181102,35-181-102,2/7/2016 4:02:59 PM,Patrick H.,Yet another great waterr cooling kit from Corsair,5," My first impressions of the Corsair H80i V2 water cooler is one of size or perhaps bulk.  This thing is big and solid.  The radiator is thicker than usual and has gray ‘Corsair’ badges on two sides, obviously to be visible after you mount it.  The rubber hoses are a full half inch in diameter and have a curious mesh texture that gives them a bit of visual flair.  The actual CPU pump/cooling block is low but wide of black plastic with a matching gray ‘Corsair’ badge.  The Intel bracket is already installed.   There is one twelve inch long fan harness that splits into 2 PWM conns and a single 3 pin conn for power.  The 2 PWM cooling fans are perfectly ordinary with gray blades and black plastic frames.  There are no rubber grommets for mounting and strangely enough there are 4 mounting bosses that appear to be for LEDs although they are empty.The accessory bag contains all the hardware needed and the USB cable for hooking up the Corsair Link software. The backplate is plastic and has sliding mounting points.  An AMD bracket is included but you will have to remove the Intel bracket and mount it yourself.  Finishing out the in box kit is a decent installation manual and a warranty guide.I'm installing the H80i V2 on my Skylake system that uses an i5 6600K processor and a Gigabyte Z170X-UD5 motherboard in a Thermaltake V41 case.  It currently has an older Cooler Master Seidon 120 M liquid cooler that works admirably well considering its age.  I haven’t really overclocked this system except as a few experiments.Installation-wise, this goes pretty much like all water coolers.  It’s fiddly having to fish the long screws down through the top of the case, through the fan and into the radiator but that’s the worst part.  The plastic backplate installs through the motherboard and then 4 standoffs thread into it.  Something that was unusual is that after you tighten down the standoffs the whole assembly is loose.  I had to check the manual to see if I was doing something wrong but I guess I wasn’t and the slack was gone after I installed the pump/cooling block.  On my particular installation I had to orient the pump and hoses so that the Corsair logo on the pump was upside down but your mileage may vary.  One thing to remember is that the stackup of 2 fans and the radiator is quite deep and it may not fit your case especially if you have big VRM heatsinks or tall Ram.  Mine worked good but the Thermaltake V41 case allows you to mount the radiator/fan assembly out toward the edge of top, away from the motherboard.There is a Corsair Link cable included that runs from the pump to a USB 2 header on your motherboard.  It reports a plethora of information on fan speeds and temperatures.  I had read that the fans on the H80i V2 were very loud at full speed and hoped to test that using the Link software but nowhere was I able to do that.  Finally I realized if you right click on the icon in the system tray it allows you to change the profile.  I chose ‘Performance’ but was able to detect no change in fan noise.   I’ll have to do more testing.Throughout testing the fans on the H80i V2 were whisper quiet and nothing I was able to do changed that.  The entire water cooling system was virtually silent with no pump noise that I could discern even when I overclocked the system."," Really not many and I'm being nit picky to name a few.  The hoses are large and stiff.  The Corsair Link software is kind of useless and you have to find it and download it.  Mounting the fan/radiator assy is fiddly and frustrating.  If, for some reason, you want to mount the radiator directly to your case there are no short mounting screws so you're on your own."," The bottom line is that the H80i V2 works as advertised.  For a stock clocked system it’s overkill so I overclocked the core i5 moderately to 4.6 gigs.  The H80i V2 never broke a sweat and at all times the fans were just about inaudible.  I played a few sessions of GTA 5 and Bioshock Infinite and the highest temp I was able to record was 45 degrees C or 113 degrees F.  Mostly it stayed around 30 degrees C or 85 degrees F.  The system idled at 23 degrees C or 73 degrees F.  I checked the rubber tubing on the H80i V2 as well as the radiator tanks and neither were more than warm.  Obviously to tax this system you need to overclock further.Like most Corsair products the H80i V2 is a quality product.  It’s well built, good looking and does just what it promises.  If you have a stock clocked system then there’s no need for a water cooling product like this.  It’s more for people that push their systems.  It’s not terribly difficult to install but unless you have a big opening in the motherboard tray on your case you will have to remove the motherboard to mount the backplate.  The rubber tubing is large diameter and quite stiff so it won’t respond well to much convoluted routing and the stackup of fans and radiator is quite deep and may interfere with heatsinks or ram on some motherboards.  All in all I give it a hearty thumbs up.",None,None
N82E16835181102,35-181-102,2/7/2016 8:53:43 AM,Michael E.,All in one water cooler,4," I find the overall design of the cooler and radiator to be pleasing.  Although I am a veteran of building PCs in my lifetime, I've never installed a water cooler before, and I did not find this to be difficult.  It's about as involved as installing a large air cooler.  You need a backing plate behind the CPU socket, there are some standoffs you need to screw in, and then you mount the cooler to the CPU and screw it down.  The radiator and fans caused me a few issues, which I'll cover below.  There is also a USB port on the cooler itself that requires a whole USB header free on your motherboard.  This shouldn't be an issue for most people as modern motherboards often have way more USB headers than most people need.This cooler is definitely quiet during regular use.  Although the DEEPCOOL cooler I had before was extremely quiet due to its rubberized 140mm silent wave fans, the Corsair is almost completely silent under most conditions.  I played with the Corsair Link software and changed the settings to Balanced and Performance and it got noticeably louder.  In Performance, it was disruptively loud.  I would never want to use that setting.This cooler replaced a DEEPCOOL Gamer Storm Lucifer V2 CPU with dual 140mm silent fans in push/pull configuration, so I was able to do a before and after test and in 2 of the 3 tests, I saw an improvement in temps, see the Other section below for specifics."," In total, not including removing the air cooler, installation took me about half an hour which I consider good because I take my time.  Anyone experienced in building PCs shouldn't have a problem with this, but for the novice, I felt the instructions were a little lacking.  Corsair takes an approach many PC vendors do and makes instructions with basic drawings and then short directions in a variety of languages.  I was installing this on a Socket 2011 motherboard and there was one step where they show you need to use different standoffs to use and the drawings were so poor, I couldn't figure it out based on the drawing.  I ended up just picking a set and using trial and error to see which ones fit.  So I'll say the instructions were adequate, but as a ""premiere"" PC Vendor, Corsair could have done a better job here.Another issue I ran into, which might be unique to some people is that the mounting screws for the radiator and fans were too short for my setup.  How this works is you get 8 long screws and washers that go into each corner of the two fans and secure it to the radiator which is sandwiched in between.  For the front fan (nearest the CPU), its not an issue.  The screws are long enough, but the rear fan (nearest the back of the case), the screws were not long enough to go through the thickness of my case, through the fan, and into the radiator.  I have a Lian-Li midtower case and the rear fan opening has a removable grille.  The removable grill isn't that thick, but it was just thick enough to make it not work.  I had to remove the rear grille in order for the screws to reach through everything and grip the radiator.  So now, the back of my PC has a large opening with the fan blades directly exposed to the outside of the case.  I am going to try and locate some longer screws at a hardware store sometime and see if I can use those so I can put the grille back on.Both of these cons aren't deal breakers, and I understand Corsair cannot predict every possible of the millions of combinations of cases people could use, but how hard could it have been to include a couple of extra sets of screws of varying lengths so the installer can choose which ones best fit.Finally, I found the included 120mm fans to be unacceptably loud in performance mode.  I cannot image why anyone would want to use that mode as the fans spin at their max speed.  Maybe quieter fans could have brought the noise down, but for what you get in the box, I feel that Quiet and Balanced are your only two real-world options."," My testing setup:ASRock X99 Extreme4 LGA 2011-v3 Intel X99 motherboardIntel Core i7-5820K Haswell-E 6-Core 3.3 GHz CPU Overclocked to 4.0 GHzLIAN LI PC-7FN Black Aluminum ATX Mid Tower CaseDEEPCOOL Gamer Storm Lucifer V2 CPU with dual 140mm silent fans in push/pull configurationI used Open Hardware Monitor to monitor the CPU Package temps and ran 3 tests:Idle10 minutes of the Unigine DirectX11 Valley Benchmark 1.0 on Ultra quality running at 1920x1080 with sound enabled10 minutes of Prime95 running with 12 threads simultaneouslyI used the Valley Benchmark to mimic high GPU gaming.  This should be close to what the CPU would experience while playing a modern PC game such as GTA V, Dyling Light, or Witcher III (all of which I have).  And of course Prime95 is a tried and true CPU torture test, although it recreates conditions unrealistic for regular PC usage.All of these tests were run with the Corsair Link software set to Quiet.  Here are my results:Idle Air Cooler: 103 - 104 degrees FIdle Water: 98 - 102 degrees FDirectX11 Air: 120-126 degrees FDirectX11 Water: 108-112 degrees FPrime95 Air: 172-176 degrees FPrime95 Water: 168-176 degrees FIt is interesting I saw a few degrees improvement at idle temps, and about 12-14 degrees improvement in the DirectX test, but nothing in the Prime95 test.  My theory with this is that my overclocked CPU is being pushed to the thermal limit of the chip.  I believe that the CPU is throttling itself at that point and neither cooler is able to keep the temps below whatever point that is.  While it would make sense that the water cooler should have shown better results in the Prime95 test, I think that in both cases, the air and water coolers were interrupted by the CPU's own thermal protection.  In hindsight, I should have done this test again with the CPU at a stock clock, so maybe I'll do that again later and update this review.  Frankly, the Prime95 test isn't really all that useful anyway, since no one runs it for anything other than these kinds of tests.  I mainly use this PC for general Internet use and gaming, so the DirectX11 test is the one that's most useful for me.So, in conclusion, yes, the Corsair bested one of the best air coolers you can buy.  For $100, you do get a few degrees improvement at idle, and about a 10% improvement in gaming.  I doubt there is any other all in one product in this range that can beat that.  I still can't feel a bit underwhelmed though.  Maybe if I was coming from a stock cooler, or a low end cooler, or maybe even with a different CPU, I would have been more impressed.  My advice is that if you are building a new PC and have $100 in your budget, this is a great buy.  If you already have a really nice air cooler and want to see what this product will do, its probably not the best use of $100.  I also feel that Corsair could have done a little better of a job in the instructions.  Sure, its fine for a veteran, but a novice could really struggle with the instructions, and I know that Corsair cannot predict every possible case that this would be installed into, but it would have cost them maybe 5 cents extra include a couple sets of screws of varying lengths to accommodate thicker cases.For these reasons, I give this product a 4 out of 5 rating.",None,None
N82E16835181102,35-181-102,2/7/2016 8:34:15 AM,Paul S.,Satisfactory cooling system,3," Overall average temp drop in my PC has gone down 5 to 8 degrees with this cooling system.All the hardware needed for install is included, and the holes and included hardware line up good.Kind of cool lighting while running.And the Corsair link software is handy to actually monitor temps of the interior of your PC."," The install manual is pretty basic, and I found I had to figure out a few things on my own.The entire unit is bulky and stiff, and is a chore to install inside the case.The biggest con to me however was the increase in noise levels from the fan system."," This was my first water cooling system, and overall it does a good job of dropping the temps inside the case. I was a bit disappointed in the increased fan noise, due to the fact that fans are directly mounted on the radiator verses just blowing out into empty air through the case vents. Don't get me wrong, the fan noise is NOT terrible, it is just increased and may not bother others.",1,1
N82E16835181102,35-181-102,2/4/2016 1:54:03 PM,Patrick S.,New look pump and hoses,5," First off I’ve owned quite a few of Corsair H series AIO coolers. My first was the H80 and currently I own an H55 and H105. For comparison I will be using the H105 on the same system with the same over clock. The H105 is a better cooler so the New H80i V2 will have its work cut out. The Corsair H80i V2 arrived in just a couple of days as usual from Newegg shipping. It was double boxed and packed appropriately. Unpacking the cooler, new changes are obvious. The new cooler has bigger thicker hoses, a new look and two 120mm fans. I also noticed right off that the new hoses will rotate at the connections. It makes it much easier to fit in tight places. The mounting system has not changed. They give you 8 long screws and washers. The screws are long enough to go through the case, fans and into the radiator. They do not include short screws. If you wanted to mount directly to the case without a fan then you’re out of luck. You will have to find screws. Also if you have a case with grommets, like me a Corsair D550, they will have to be removed as the screws are not long enough to go through the grommets and fan. The mounting system is identical to the H105 so I had it installed in less than 15 minutes. Also the screw holes are not directly over a fin, so no chance of puncturing the radiator with a screw.  The new look is great and the new pump logo lights up in white. For the performance comparison I note that the H105 is using a cured application of Arctic Silver 5 and is only 6 months old, where the H80i V2 will be using a fresh install of the stock thermal material. Test system is an i7 4790K @ 4.6Ghz and 1.24v. The case is a Corsair D550 with positive pressure. Bench test app is the OCCT and using real temp as well to monitor temps. All stress tests were all ran at least 20 minutes. Ambient temps did not change during the three tests.  Corsair H105: After 20 min CPU Linpack. CPU temps are 66c – 69c Corsair H80i V2: After 20 min CPU Linpack CPU temps are 73c – 77cBoth tests were using PWM fans and not full speed. The H105 was loud being I could hear it in the other room. The H80i V2 was quiet being slightly louder than a stock CPU fan; I could not hear it in the other room at all. I also tested the H80i V2 with one fan. The results were 75c – 80c. I was a little surprised how well the H80i V2 did being so quiet. I actually prefer it over the H105. I don’t run high over clocks so it will do fine and maintain a semi silent system."," No short screws, stiff hoses, grommets will have to be removed from the case.", This is compatible with the new 1151 Skylake CPU mounts. I love Corsair AIO cooling systems. They work well and just seem to be getting better over the years. Keep in mind with a sealed AIO system they don’t last forever. I can’t speak for the H80i V2 yet about longevity. But my old H80 and H100 lasted for about three years then the performance started to degrade. I think this is typical of all sealed cooling systems. It has a two year warranty.,7,7

So very disappointed.," Since they first arrived on the scene, I've bought a number of these AIO water coolers to use in custom builds because they *were* built like a tank. Not anymore. Just took delivery of a new one and was shocked at what I discovered. It's a ""V2"" marked unit (as in version 2, I guess) and my disappointment knows no bounds.It appears as though Enermax decided to go cheap with the latest iteration in order to save a buck. The radiator is no longer constructed with the stiff, hard-to-bend aluminum grill from the V1 units, but is instead made of a thinner, cheaper, and easier to damage alternative. And not only that, it doesn’t even fill up the entire width of the radiator housing! There’s an approximately quarter inch gap on either side so the radiator itself is probably around half an inch wide total. Isn’t maximizing the total surface area of the cooling material sort of, you know, important when it comes to a device designed for heat dissipation? Yet somehow, someone thought it was a good idea shrink it by nearly 50% as compared to the previous version? Good job.The unit I just bought worksed so I can’t really return it for a refund (and this PC build is for someone who needs the computer right away), but from now on Enermax won’t get any of my business. Object lesson to any and all manufactures out there. You create a great product, it gets very favorable reviews and generates good word of mouth, thereby cultivating a loyal customer base. Please then, don’t turn around and flush that all down the toilet just because some accountant thought it a good idea to shave a couple bucks off production costs and use markedly cheaper material. All that hard won good will and loyalty built up over time will evaporate in a blink of an eye.Moving forward, I’ll be telling my PC building enthusiast friends and customers to avoid this product like the plague lest they too want to receive an inferior product. So disappointed in Enermax. Thought I found a company that, despite costs, cared about consistently delivering high quality products to their customers (e.g. Noctua) but instead was just another in a long line that decided to pull the good ol' bait-and-switch.

9SIA4RE5060827,35-214-058,5/6/2015 4:53:43 PM,Garrett C.,Wonderful product,5," This AIO is a well built unit! I didn't 'disbelieve' the other reviewers or Jayztwocents video review but I now have first hand experience with the item. Being my first liquid cooler I was not sure quite what to expect but I am very pleased with my purchase. I installed this on my older Asus P6X58D-E mother board with an i7 960 overclocked at 4.2GHz. I'm pushing it hard with 1.365Vcore and my CM 212 Evo was keeping up for normal gaming but lacking when running Prime95.The individual cores with the 212 Evo were running 92C +/- max on Prime95, 65-70C gaming and 45-47C at idle.My temps are now 78C max (prime95), 45-50C (gaming) and 39-41C at idle. Big improvement for a 140W CPU with a 24% OC. On the mobo the Mosfet requires active cooling from the fans of the CPU heatsink but that became an issue with the AIO. To remedy this I installed an 80mm fan blowing directly on the Mosfet. It is now running cooler than with the 212 Evo sense the air is blowing more directly on the heatsink for the Mosfet. The temps here went from 30C to 25C. The pump is virtually silent. I plugged the fans and pump in prior to installing the unit to make sure it all ran well. I couldn't tell if the pump was running or not. Had to rely on the LED for that.The fans are very quiet as well so long as you regulate them at 2000 rpm. If you let them run wild they get pretty noisy above the 2000 and they spool up and down a lot as the temps change.Mounting was easy in my Cooler Master HAF X case. Hoses are perfect length if radiator is mounted with hoses towards the front.", None," My first unit was received 9 days ago but temps were above the 212 Evo. Turns out the copper heat plate on bottom of pump was warped. I called and emailed Enermax and within a day and a half they had a new pump/radiator/hose assembly heading my way. No mounting kit or fans but that is OK with me. I received the new unit last night and installed it and I've had it running sense.I am very impressed with Enermax and EcoMaster. EcoMaster takes care of Enermax's warranty work. My experience with them and their product has made me a very happy customer! Nice thing is they didn't want the defective parts back. I'm sure I can put it to use... somehow, somewhere :DI highly recommend this product to anyone looking at an AIO in the 240mm range.",1,1

I like the pump bracket, very solid, just put on the CPU, tight down the four screws evenly, all the way down, no guess work that how far, how tight the screws should be tighten. There are thin rubber strips run along the length of the radiator, where fans are mounted. This will reduce the vibration from the running fans. Thanks to a well-thought design.

I told myself ""If you can afford the item without the rebate, buy it. Do not count the rebate into the final price."" So, I bought the cooler without counting on the rebate. Yet, silly me sit down, go online, register the rebate, print out the form, cut the bar code, pack into the envelope, stamp it, and send out. I dropped the rebate envelope in a mail box along with this year CA tax returns (myself and my wife). After two weeks, I got the state tax refund. While the rebate document has not received by the company that processes the rebate. Silly me or USPS? Rebate document always has a better chance to be lost in the mail, more than any important document that we dropped in the mail box. It's a big mystery to me.

This works but its not the prettiest thing due to the multicolored fan cables and the round screws exposed above my case. (Fractal Define R4)3.

The radiator now fires directly out through my 200mm oversized case-top fans in a big cooolermaster case and life is good.This unit looks awesome, though I don't care.  But that was nice to see.The cooling capability is PERFECT.  I'm not an extreme pusher, but I took this 8-core monster CPU from stock 3GHz to 4.6GHz with only multiplier and moderate voltage in a very short time.  The CPU is idling around 35C, ordinary desktop use spends very little time above 40C without ever hearing the twin 120mm fans on the radiator.  In order to cause any fan noise I have to get most or all of the 8 cores up above 80% for any length of time.  I think the pump runs at a fixed rate while the radiator fans are variable (and PWM, I think?  not 100% on that).  Basically in order to get any loudness out of this rig I have to do things I normally wouldn't ever need to do, or I have to intentionally benchmark or burn-in.  I have not gone into heavy gaming with this box yet so it remains to be seen whether I will ever hear the radiator over average game sound but I really doubt it.This is WAY quieter than my old air-cooled rigs with Noctua push/pull fan blocks.  There's no way I will ever go back to air cooling if liquid cooling is this easy and successful.  It's over.The overall build quality and solidity of the parts in this unit is just amazing.", The hose length is just short enough to slightly reduce the possibilities for various mounting locations.  But users to whom that really matters are likely building their own cooling loops., I look forward to a very long and enjoyable service life on this.  I expected to be slightly scared and un-trusting of liquid cooling but this has been an unexpectedly solid first experience.  Strongly recommended.,2,3

After experience with the other ""shiny metal"" maker of liquid CPU coolers, this product has much less fan noise. Using this with the standard fans, PWM dual connector is supplied, so both fans run off the single 4-pin PWM motherboard CPU connector, while the pump is connected to the additional 3-pin CPU connector. Be sure to enable the CPU fan control in the BIOS for Auto, so that the motherboard can adjust the fan speed automatically based on thermal CPU temps.", None noted.," If you can turn your case upside down to install the radiator, this will make the installation process a one-person job.

Typically you will run into SOMETHING while installing your AIO cooler that will turn out to be something you can or can not live with, but this Enermax unit did not present any major issues.  It fit, it works, and I have no real complaints.  Here is the performance I am seeing after extensive testing:First, the test setup:1.  Ambient air temp of 72 deg F2.  AIDA 64 Extreme used for all temperature and fan speed monitoring, along with with the load testing.3.  The TIM provided was discarded and I used my go-to TIM which is Prolimatech PK-3.  My experience has shown this is the best TIM out there right now and I have used just about all of them.4.  The radiator is in top mount position, with the fans mounted below it drawing air up and out of the case pushing through the radiator.  The fans were left at the default 600 RPM to 2000 RPM range via the switches on the fan motors and the fan speeds are varied by my system BIOS.5.  IDLE temps were recorded after the system had been pretty much idling all day.  LOAD temps were recorded after 30 minutes with a reset on the averages about 2 minutes into the test so the results were not skewed.  Therefore the LOAD temps are averaged over a 28 minute period, having had 2 minutes to come up in number from idle.6.  My motherboard uses multi-core enhancement, moving up the turbo bins.  When I load all four cores the motherboard will push all cores to 3.8 GHz.My system rig:MSI Z97M Gaming, v. 1.2 BIOSG.Skill Ares DDR3-2133 11-13-13-31, 16 GB (2 X 8GB sticks), 1.5VCore i7-4790Enermax Liqtech 240mm AIO water coolerSanDisk Extreme II SSD, 480 GB as OS/PrimaryMSI Gaming GTX770 TF video card, at factory default overclockSeagate hybrid 3.5"" 7200 RPM HDD 1TB as mass storageLG DVD/RWSeasonic GII 650W PSUSteelseries Rival Optical MousetT-Esports Poseidon Z Blue switch mechanical keyboardKlipsch Promedia 2.1 system and Razor ORCA cansDell U2312 IPS display at 1080p via DVICorsair Obsidian 350D caseWindows 8.1 Update 1 64 bitResults:IDLE:Core 0   25 deg CCore 1   27 deg CCore 2   23 deg CCore 3   30 deg CLOAD, all cores, all threads, 3.8 GHz (multi-core enhancement is used by MSI)Core 0   57 deg CCore 1   55 deg CCore 2   55 deg CCore 3   54 deg COther Pros:1.

So, following directions from Newegg and from Deepcool, I have been e-mailing Deepcool support at support@deepcool.com.  They are slow to respond.  I have clearly stated the problem, and then they ask what the problem is, for which I have already responded.  I have provided my invoice and serial numbers and they ask for them again.  Then they even asked me to make a video to prove that the pump noise is from the Deepcool CPU unit, and not something else.  I replaced this cooler with a heat pipe cooler from Cooler Master and my computer is running flawlessly- evidencing that I have correctly diagnosed my machine. I won't shoot a video because I'm not going to run a faulty cooler on my expensive CPU.  Given the ignorance of my provided information, it would seem to be a wasted effort anyway.  That's a ridiculous thing to ask a customer to do anyhow.  Customers should not have to operate broken equipment and shoot videos to send to support for their approval.

I had my skepticism initially but this really does work very efficiently.- Overall good looking," - The tubing is a bit excessively long.

The fan didn't stop working but it was making an awful noise.- Hose busted after about a year (11 months) and got liquid all over my computer.

Not sure if it was wearing out or what, but my 4790k was throttling big time at stock speeds. I decided to pull the trigger on this since it is the cheapest 360 rad that I have seen. The performance of this thing is just fantastic! I was able to overclock my 4790k to 4.8 stable. It runs at about 60 degrees Celsius when gaming. Prime 95 it tops out at about 85. Which for a 4.8 OC, that's fantastic. At stock speeds it runs about 50 degrees in gaming and tops out about 70 in prime 95. The fans on this thing are high quality as well. It is also a good looking cooler. The pump has a red pulsing LED and a clear tube to let you know that is working. The tubes are quite long so it could be front mounted or top mounted in just about any case with ease.Comes with it's own fan splitter that has 4 inputs. So the 3 fans that come with it and 1 extra if your mobo runs out.Super easy to install."," About the only thing negative that I have to say about it is that the tubes have that cheap ribbed plastic on them. Not a fan of that, but it in no way impedes functionality or performance."," My h100i was really good with my old 2600k, but time and more heat from the 4790k forced this upgrade, but it has been one of the best that I have done in a while.",1,1

I was able to put it I my haf932 but only in one position on the top. the waterblock surface is kinda small and the amount of copper could have been more for better thermal conductivity. fins are aluminum and make me wonder about longevity with differing metal interactions and corossion. anyways, one of the main reasons I got the unit was because it was supposed to have a decent pump that would last for a really long time. I wanted to like this cooler because it is really awesome looking and goes well with my build theme. but almost precisely at the 6 month mark, the pump  fails and temps get dangerously  high. instead of dealing with a complicated China sourced rma,  I just decided to salvage the fans which are of rather good quality and cut my losses. I have since moved on to the u.s. sourced swiftech h220x OPEN looped system. the build quality and materials used simply cannot be compared to this garbage. with the swiftech a LEGITAMATE pump is used. you can turn it to  full custom loop if you desire, it looks even more awesome and if in the event something does fail, it is u.s. based for easy assistance. moral of the story, stay away from the deepcool ""FAILBOAT"" captain 360.",,3,3

I always liked them, but I got to realizing that their software customizations was getting too large and it always wouldn't work.  I also wanted a 360 solution and I came across deepcool's Captain 360.The quality of the build is great!  It fit perfectly into my Z170 socket motherboard and the layout of the water tubing into the CPU block is perfect.  I have found that with some all-in-one coolers, the tubing didn't always lay correctly down.  This cooler can be positioned 360 degrees around the socket without issue.  Great Job!I didn't use the fans that came with the unit because I wanted the new LED Aerocool fans and they work perfectly.  The fans that came with the unit look high quality from what I can tell.  Again, quality all around.On top of the CPU cooler there is an LED that breathes red in and out slowly.  I really like this because it is subtle."," There are only two cons I can come up with.  Firstly, all the packaging says that it is an 'amazing' visual flow system where you can see it.  Well, the exposed clear tubing with red coolant is visible, but you can't tell if it's flowing.  There are no bubbles (which is good) but no flow meter as well, so I don't get how you can visually verify flow.  You just can't!The other con is simple.  I wish there was an ability to change or turn off the LED on the CPU cooler.  Again, it is subtle and has a nice breathing effect, but some may want a different color or to turn it off entirely.  I wouldn't want a software solution here like Corsair, just a 4-way pin switch on the side that could maybe go from green, red, blue and off."," DeepCool really has a winner here.  I seen a couple of comments about longevity issues, but only time will tell for me if there will be a problem.  SO FAR SO GOOD!",4,4

Deepcool DID take care of the issue sending me a complete hardware kit (only needed the 4 screws and bolts though) and a TF120 as a gift.  They seemed nice enough and their response through email was daily.  Satisfied yes so far.  Why the double sided bolts were bad is two guesses: either manufactured wrong or this was a bad installation return that someone else stripped the bolts.  New bolts from Deepcool are fine.",1,1

The nuts just slide down the bolt.  This is for a 2011 V3 setup.  The other bolts work with the screws for other chips but I can't use those.  I asked Newegg via chat for other bolts and they said they didn't have any, try the manufacturer or a hardware store, really???  Not sure, but maybe open another cooler box and send me those after you check them.... Obviously my local hardware store will not be carrying these bolts, so they said contact Deepcool, which I did and they are in China and on vacation for the next 3 days with an additional wait of 1-2 days after that....along with IF they send me new double headed bolts it would take about a month to get FROM CHINA.

The pulsating line on the pump looks nice, but it not overbearing. Much softer light then the ridiculous blueness radiating off of my motherboard.The fans are very nice; they are audible at 100% but it's like a.. woosh, not a typhoon. Between the rubberized blades, the fact that they are serviceable, and the rubber corner mounts, these fans feel and seem to perform very good.3x120mm radiator, more surface area, slower fan speeds, comparable temps and less noise. No fitment issues mounted in the top of my Fractal Design Define S.No funky pump noise and still going strong."," The radiator.. specifications list it at 32mm thick; this is NOT TRUE. The radiator itself is some where around 17-18mm stick, the rest is bracket. This may not be a deal breaker to some, but I was looking for a thicker radiator to further enable lower fan speeds. Still keeping cool at basically inaudible speed, but figured I would spit that out here for anyone going along the same train of though. More research would have done me some good.The instructions are pretty much a folded up picto-graph, but if you've installed a high end CPU cooler in the last four years then you've been there done that.The lines, specifically the fittings in the pump, are kinda stiff and may freak people doing an AIO water cooler for the first time. No leakage or horrible creaking noises while fitting everything in the case, but it's less than ideal so there you go."," Mounted in the top of a Fractal Design Define S and cooling an Intel i7 3930k. No fitment issues at all, cooler went right on and not coming anywhere close to encroaching on the motherboard heat sinks of my MSI motherboard.Temps hover around 27-30 at idle and have not seen my 3930k break 50 degrees Celsius using intel burn test at standard stress level.",None,None

Installation is the usual affair and shouldn't be any trouble for anyone familiar."," Some parts feel cheaper, I don't feel that there is any concerns about the reliability or performance of them, but it does make it look worse up close than other coolers using better materials. I think it looks well enough considering.Fans will be very noisy at full speed, rubber dampens vibrations of course, but the fans will be spinning quite fast. There isn't much need for them to run full speed, so you won't worry about that often or at all depending on your build/use.For a 360mm AIO, it doesn't really perform better than some 240mm ones. If you don't have the space for 360mm, no need to fret, there are 240mm ones that perform similar."," Colors and style match my motherboard.

9SIA4RE4YD5748,35-856-025,6/22/2015 10:16:04 AM,Justin E.,"Great cooler, a little large",4," Looks really nice.  The fans supplied are all pretty decent quality and look quite good.  I really like the rubberized coating that the fan housing has as it is a great integration of vibration reduction.  It’s worth noting that all three fans in the kit are PWM 4-pin fans.  They seem well built and don’t produce any excess noise above the standard amount of air noise.  You will probably want to control these fans some how as there are three of them and they move a lot of air at full speed which is pretty noisy. My unit was able to maintain reasonable temps without bringing the fans up very high.The pump is essentially noiseless even from a few inches away.  I couldn’t hear it even when I rigged it up on a test bench by itself.  My unit appears to have gotten a proper fluid fill as there wasn’t any audible gurgling or air in the line upon starting it up.Kit comes with a little fan splitter (not a controller, just a splitter) that works with 4-pin fans.  I like that I can wire the whole thing up to one fan header on my motherboard and control it through BIOS if I desire (if you do this hook up the pump separately as I found that this reduced the speed of the pump as well).It’s nice that all fans and water pump are separately wired.  Makes it easy to replace fans in the future if needed.Waterblock/pump unit is pretty small and about 3 inches to the very top of the plastic inlet loop.  Pretty handy if you are working with a small amount of space.  Also, there is a small amount of flexibility in rotating the fittings on the side of the block for better tube routing.  Be careful if you wish to rotate these however, as I’m not sure they are supposed to be turned.  Mine however, turned quite easily and didn’t leak after moving so perhaps it is by design.  Installing the mounting brackets is fairly straightforward and only requires a small phillips screwdriver.  Getting the backplate on is made quite easy with the bolts provided that snap on to the backplate.  The pre-applied thermal paste works well enough but you may want to opt for something better if you prefer.My standard Phenom II x4 at 3.8GHz hovers at around 38C at idle (25C ambient room temp) and then 45C at full load using Prim95 for 4 hours.Overclocking to 4GHz raised the idle temp to 39C at idle and 52C full load running Prime95 for 4 hours.", This unit is quite big.  I suppose that is probably apparent but I advise measuring carefully to make sure it will fit in your case.  You’ll need a little more than three 120mm fan slots to accommodate as the radiator is a little longer than just the fans when accounting for hose fittings etc etc.  The whole unit is about 3 inches deep with the fans installed.The tubing running from the radiator to the pump isn’t as long as I’d have liked.  You probably get about 6 - 8 inches; which is pretty short depending on where you have to mount the rad., System Specs:AMD Phenom II x4 955 BE (overclocked to 4GHz)8GB Corsair Dominator DDR3 1333ASRock 870 EXTREME3 AM3 Motherboard250GB Samsung Pro SSD,2,2

It looks pretty nice once it's all installed and running.  The packaging was adequate to protect the contents (I've had this problem with some DEEPCOOL products before).  Due to its size, the retail box can also be used as a small table if you need one."," Loud at top speeds.  This isn't a big problem since you won't be running this at top speeds unless you're benchmarking or Folding or something.DEEPCOOL products are cheap. And I don't just mean by price. While it visually looks nice, physically there's a lot of plastic here, and it feels cheap in your hand.  Much expense was spared in the instructions department too.  You can check those out ahead of time on their website.  If you've never installed one of these babies before, please look elsewhere for a company that does some hand-holding with the installation instructions.  For real.  A water cooler is not something you want to find out you installed incorrectly (such as by using the wrong screws) while jacking up the settings on your CPU.  That said, they do have a decent YouTube installation instructions video on their support website."," I've used multiple DEEPCOOL products in the past.  General rule of thumb is what I mentioned before - they're cheap and lack instructions but they do a very good job if you install them properly. This guy is big, so make sure it's going to fit before you order it.Watercooling rigs aren't really going to help you if you don't overclock your machine.  A good air cooler works just as well for everyday usage.

People seemed to lump this system in with the average solutions around. The fact is that this cooling solution is amazing. I am utilizing a Vishera AMD 8350 and I needed to run it cool. Since my build was red themed, I was instantly drawn to this solution. It looks stunning but more importantly it preforms when pushed. I ran the processor under heavy loads and my experience was stunning. I maintained a constant 42 degrees while running stock CPU speed during a stress test that last over 15 minutes. The aesthetics of the fans are awesome, the quality of the fans are second to none. The pump is also very sturdy and well built; the radiator also seemed less massive once I installed it. The qualities of the main components are very good. I am so impressed that I have decided that DEEPCOOL cooling solutions will be what I use from now on. It is also worth mentioning that I purchased several of their 140mm fans and when coupled with this Captain 360 the results are phenomenal. The ease of installation also helped seal the deal for my business."," As for cons, they are simple. The lines are rigid and plastic which doesn’t compare to the other high quality components.

After all of the troubles Ive been going through, I finally get to test this radiator. Mind you, this is the 3rd, so its not going to get more than 3 eggs off of me. I went from a Coolermaster N520 to this Captain 360, and I can honestly say this is amazing me. I didnt think I would drop an additional 8c in temps. I averaged 32c with the air cooled unit, now Im down about 24 average. I never topped out more than 60c in Prime95 with a 4.5ghz overclock on an Intel 4770k. Your mileage may vary, I have mine set up in a unique manner. Ive used the other radiator fans from the last defective unit, and did a little shopping at home depot for some longer screws. I managed to get 6 fans on the radiator instead of the 3 it comes with, so I have a lot more cooling power than this kit comes with. As of now, I have 9 fans + closed loop cooling my system. I didnt think another 8-10c degree drop would be possible without a refrigerator...I was wrong."," This was my 3rd attempt to rate DeepCool Captain products. The first pump leaked, and the second unit had a warped radiator. Patience is not my strong point, but I will say that aside from the defective parts, this is a very cool unit.

Looks awesome, high MTBF of pump, fans, triple rad, very quiet pump, tubing is exactly the same as corsairs older H50/H100 models, radiator thickness and overall construction is somewhat solid. No leaks when bench tested stand alone for 24 hours of operation. Keeps my oc'd 3770k at an acceptable temperature."," In my previous post I listed some things that need improving. I did not have a difficult time installing this liquid cooler. I would like it to be as simple as possible for everyone. Yes, there is INTEL/AMD stamped in the backplate to show orientation but when mounted the manual shows the words upside down. The instructions are poor for the inexperienced first time builder. I build, repair, troubleshoot and run quality control on computers/monitors for a living. If i'm having to re look at the pictures over and over then there's a problem. You cannot just mount it 4 different ways. Its not possible because the tubing is not pliable. The tubing is either hitting the rear exhaust fan or your vrm heatsinks are in the way. The way the pictures are in the manual I think are the best and only option available unit they change orientation of the tubes to route downward like corsair liquid coolers."," I had high expectations of this liquid cooler. Being a triple radiator and having such a well engineered pump it was very similar in cooling/performance to my old corsair H100 which has a dual radiator. Since this radiator has a lot more surface area than my corsair, I thought I would see a 5-8 degree difference. I received my 4 pin m/f fan extensions for the fan splitter which each fan is connected to. I set my chassisfan1(pwm automatic header) speed, and target at 50C. Fans are very quiet at idle and low work loads. Played a few games and the speed only increased a few times during game play.",1,1

No leaks when bench tested stand alone for 24 hours of operation. Keeps my oc'd 3770k at an acceptable temperature."," I've been running liquid cooling closed loop units since the corsair H50 which was launch in mid 2009. This replaced my H100 liquid cooler. When comparing design, physical installation, installation manual/guides to corsairs products, well DeepCool has a long way to go. First thing I noticed when I removed it from the box was that the pump was in the complete opposite orientation than all the corsair water cooling units. I was scratching my head thinking how I was going to install this by looking at the installation manual. I wanted no stress on the tubes. You can only rotate the inlet/outlet pump connectors to a certain degree. The tubing is not very pliable. Corsair actually changed their tubing with their newer units because of this reason. When bending the inlet/outlet connectors at the pump wiggled where you can see a 1mm or so gap. I mounted all the fans to the radiator. You can only get about 1-1.5 turns. They make them shorter because the outer shroud of the fans are flexible. If they were any longer most people would bottom them out into the radiator fins without knowing. If you want to mount plastic material fans you need longer screws. I bench tested this unit for 24 hours and no leaks were found. Here comes the fun part. Now I have setup as a push and pull. I installed the fans that were in the box on top with 3 bitfenix fans at the bottom. I ran into issues with the universal AMD/Intel backplate. My nzxt switch 810 has a cutout in the floor of the chassis for easy cpu/cooler installs without removing the entire motherboard. The amd portion of the backplate hit. I had to install the top left screw first, push it through, then put the plastic end cap onto the backplate. In the installation manual the pictures are not shaded. Its hard to tell orientation of the bends of the backplate. Please update the pictures to the solidworks design view pictures since they have shading. Now installing the brackets on the water pump was frustrating as well. Maybe I am used to corsairs breeze installation/patented design. When installing the thumbscrews (which hold down the pump to the backplate) the top right area where you would install the thumbscrew is covered by the tubing. I had to remove my ram and pull the tubing out of the way to install the thumbscrew. (if the orientation of the pump/tubes were like corsairs this would not have happened) Another issue was the tubing was pushing against my ram modules. I had to put a more increased bend at the pump and at the radiator inlet/outlet. There is a lot of stress on the tubing the way this was engineered and manufactured. I noticed that the pumps center outlet tubing is crooked and not entirely straight. I ran some benchmarks, valley, prime95 etc. to compare the temperatures. It was disappointing when compared to my H100. I am averaging exactly 32.75C idle which my corsair was 27-30C idle. (using core temp, took average of cores) In bios it reads 42C which read 36C with H100."," Another con, the fan cables are only 12"" long. The three fans and the 4 fan splitter  would not reach to the bottom of my pwm 4 pin motherboard fan header. I have to run them at 100% RPM atm. I had to order two 4pin m/f fan extensions. I have a full tower ATX with a EATX motherboard. During gaming (far cry 4, maxed out ultra 1440p) my 3770k @ 4.2Ghz was  average 50.75C, highest core was 56C. Prime95 average was 65C under 100% load for 3 hours. This is acceptable. Compared to the corsair units, which they have been making for almost 6 years.....I would buy a corsair. You'll get very very easy installation, well written installation manual, solid connections, great engineering and performance. I was in the market for a new liquid cooler, especially a triple rad closed loop system which I have been waiting on for a long time. Corsair does make a 140mm dual fan, 240mm thick rad which is similar to a triple radiator. Deepcool did a great job with the looks of this water cooler unit. I have to give them credit for that. I think if they fixed the orientation of the pump/tubing, made a stronger solid inlet/outlet connectors at the pump, went with the corsairs newest water tubing, (the pliable stuff) design engineers revised the installation guide, extended all the fans wiring to 18"" because longer is always better(function over form), possibly making two separate backplates (amd/intel), increased the flow rate of the pump for better cooling or came up with a better block flow/conductive surface.  I'd rather have a little louder pump, (yes MTBF would be slightly lower) and the speed its at right now is silent since your case fans are damping the pumps noise. This would be one of the best liquid coolers on the market!",2,2

Under load I never go past 42c.The ""breathing"" LED looks like a beating heart, and the nuclear reactor look really sets it apart from other AIOs....took a look at some of the other DEEPCOOL products before purchasing this, they all have a pretty unique look.Fans are inaudible until around the 70-100% speeds, but you can really feel them move air.

Much quieter than my old XSPC pump/res combo that was fixed speed, and seems to have no issue pumping just as much water if not more.  Flow rate is just fine for my dual GPU (parallel) and CPU (series) loop with triple fan radiator and Alphacool 150mm reservoir even on the lowest setting.  Mounting holes, while not standardized to a fan mount or anything, are convenient and you can just mount to some vent grill or something if you don't want to drill holes.  I mounted it to the vent grill on the bottom of my Corsair 750D case.  Alternatively, it has a sticky pad if you don't want to use screws.  Power is simple enough, just a 12V molex connector.  Built in barbs mean you don't have to buy additional fittings.  You can remove the pump motor from the front housing if you wish to use third party housings that might look a little nicer, but I am using the included housing as-is and it works great.", Wish it would have had a mounting bracket to fit a 120mm or 140mm standard fan mount so I didn't have to attach it to a random vent grill mesh.," Only had it going maybe a month, but it feels like a high quality unit and if other reviews and the hype surrounding this particular pump holds, I expect it will last a nice long time, unlike my previous pump which died after a year and a half.",None,None

The MCP655 (d5) is significantly more muted than the old D4 was.  It's not quite as quiet as the DDC350 (ddc3.1), however it vibrates less, and transfers less vibrations to the case and hoses and anything else it's touching.The power is very impressive.  There is plenty of head pressure, so restrictive water loops are not a concern and the flow rates are almost ridiculous.  My performance returns diminished rapidly when I turned the pump passed setting 3, but if you use an impingement based block on a highly overclocked CPU you may still find a use for settings 4 and 5."," My biggest complaint would be the lack of standard 1\4"" threading for fittings.

They say just plug the pump and fan connectors into any header on the board!  Well that's just silly.  I chose to plug the fans into the 4-pin CPU header so my m4a785TDV-EVO motherboard would use the temperature of the CPU to determine how fast the fans on the radiator should spin.  My board had 3 pin Chassis and Power headers.  The Chassis header fan speed is determined by motherboard temperatore, while it appears that Power header fan speed is full speed all the time.  i plugged the pump into the Power header as I had read that the pump might perform best at full 12 volts.  The board reports the pump is spinning at 1450RPM if that can be trusted. I have a Molex-to-3pin adapter coming that I may use just to be sure the pump gets 12v.  Nothing on the Corsair site or docs give any details so this may all be a waste of time but I believe plugging the radiator fans into the CPU header was definitely the right way to go.", For $75 I do have some concerns about longevity and leaks but there is a 5 year warranty.  I thought it was worth the gamble.Took my Phenom II x4 955 from a jet engine at full speed to nice and civilzed inside my 10+ years old Lian Li case.  I was often choosing to run it throttled down to keep the cooler fan quiet.  I considered a giant passive heat sink but something bout that thing dangling off of a vertical board made my itch.

So I had to use washers on the back of the motherboard (some extras that they included for the radiator and some others I had laying around).  Strange as this is a fairly popular motherboard and no mention of this in the install video."," I guess it's possible that it doesn't need to be snug against it and that when you attached the cooling unit with the 4 thumbscrews it will pull it snug.  But if that is the case, I think they should have mentioned that it will be lose until the cooling unit is attached.  I didn't feel like risking it.",2,2

The cooler with the push, pull fans extends quite a ways from the panel it's mounted on. The radiator tanks, or caps extend far enough to sometimes prevent mounting in some locations.  This is particularly true of the side by side fan/radiator set up. They may not fit all full size towers.  Sometimes a minor mod to the tower, or mounting is all that's needed.

In fact, it ONLY works with the stock backplate. This is like selling a car without wheels, and designing it so that the owner has to use the wheels from their first car. It's absolutely ridiculous that they would charge close to $100 for a product, and not even include all of the hardware for it.*Once I prayed hard enough that I kept my stock backplate in the box my Hyper 212 came in, and was lucky enough that I actually did, installing the radiator was a huge pain in the rear. Getting all 4 screws to go through the fan into the radiator at the same time is nearly impossible. You can't do them one at a time, because they require washers. I wound up having to superglue the screws and washers in place until I could get the radiator lined up. *One of the included thumbscrews didn't fit the standoffs. I tried different screws and different standoffs, and determined that it was in fact the thumbscrew. It seems like a manufacturing defect, and not Corsair's fault, but it was the last straw with this product. It works well without the 4th screw, but being that this is supposedly a high end product from a high end company, I would expect it to come with all of the parts in working order. I contact customer support, and explained that I only need another thumbscrew. They want me to RMA the entire unit. After all of the stuff I went through to get this product installed, there is no way in hell I'm uninstalling it just to reinstall a new one over a simple screw. If I do return it, I am not buying another one. I'll go with something from Cooler Master or NZXT. Anybody but this company."," All things considered, the unit does work in the end, which is why it's getting more than 1 egg. Suffering through the pain that is installation though, I would not recommend this product until I see some proof that Corsair resolves such blatantly obvious and easy to fix issues.",1,9

I have heard that this was easy to install and everything but as it is my first liquid cooler I can only speak to what I noticed.

Cheaper than some air coolers.," It doesn't come with a backplate for AMD. Not a huge deal, I fortunately always keep the oem backplates and hardware when I install an aftermarket cooler but it would have been nice for them to include one.It doesn't cool as well as I was expecting. I went to this from the Zalman CNPS12X and that cools a lot better than this does. Now, yes, it's massive but it has to be as an air cooler. That would never let my cpu temps go above 50C under load. I think with prime95 running for about an hour, it went up to 52C and that isn't even a real world situation. You will never max out cpu load for an hour straight so that is still pretty good. The H75 lets it get up to about 54C when gaming. At idle, it's about 40-41C. When I power it on, if I do nothing but let windows boot, it will run around 37C but as soon as I start doing anything, the goes up to 40-41C and stays there. Not bad but the Zalman kept it around 38-39C when not gaming or putting heavy loads on the cpu. If you want a smaller cooler and maybe something quieter, this is a good choice. If you're overclocking or doing series gaming and things that heavily tax your cpu, go with a different cooler.",,2,2

There is no way to monitor this system, no way to see the fluid level, no way to know if it is low because it is leaking at times when it gets warm.  This could cost you big bucks and you will have no where to turn to recoup the losses this device can cause you."," Using water to cool a CPU: what could go wrong?  I am a enthusiast and spend most of my money on systems.  I have been overclocking since the days when you needed to cut traces on the CPU.  I have been building water custom water cooling systems since before anyone made parts for them, so I came to believe that such systems were so simple that anyone could do it safely.  Not so with this little gem.  Let me tell you what it did and perhaps save you thousands of dollars.  Everything was going fine with my latest gaming build then one night while blasting down the Nuburgring in my C9 Mercedes, the fan on my 1000W Corsair PS started spinning like crazy, like a jet engine.  Which had never happened before, it hardly ever even spins at all. It spun like this for about two seconds, then there was a bang and the power in my apartment went out.  Why?  because this thing was subtley leaking and it finally caused a catastrophic short in my $2500 gaming computer.  It destroyed a $600 dollar video card, my Power supply, my mother board, a fuse and it actually blew out a breaker on the breaker board on the side of the house, so I was in the dark until the next day and an electrician could come by.  Do not buy this product, you may save a few bucks and some time over building a real water cooling system, but this could happen to you.  Like I mentioned, I like water cooling, but having this kind of failure of your product even as a possiblility, and I am living proof that this happens, is toally unacceptable.  And I bet most of the time, such failures are not ever attributed to the real cause of a leak, because it was subtle, you could look in the case right at the hoses and stuff and not have been able to see the leak.  It was dry when examined after the failure.  It had all night to sit in the dark and dry out, and it was only by the subltle marks left by the coolant on the MB and video card that I was finally able to determine after months of RMA in parts and rebuilding that I realized there was very little coolant in this system,  The fact that fluid was missing from the cooler was not apparent, as the hoses and water block are heavy in comparison to the coolant and the system is totally opague, so you really never know what is going on with it.  Also in my case, it seems it only leaked at times when it got pretty warm.  I blamed this failure on the motherboard until I finally reassembled it and it would not run for more than ten minutes.    Finally, the marks on the Video card and mother board are understood to be the residue from evaporaed cooliing fluid, not the result of some failure of their own.There is no way to protect yourself from this happening to you, and it can happen, and you may not know what is going on because you cannot see or really tell the coolant levels.  Not worth the risk, save yourself many head aches and use big air or a high quality water system that has clear tubes, a resevoir and highly visible fluids that you can at least monitor and know if there is a problem before it is too late.Protect yourself form this device destroying your system.  If you bought one of these things return it if you can, because what do you think you will get out of the LEPA?  I am about to notify them about this and see if they are a stand-up company or if it will be some kind of corporate policy to screw people over when their products fail and blame everyone but themselves,  I am betting on the later.  I will update this review when they respond. I am disabled and though this happened last November, I have only yesterday been able to get my system back on line and even now I am using on board graphics because the video card this thing destroyed had to be sent in to be repaired again, because there was continuing corrosion that caused another failure.Worked ok at first, but ended up less than a year later costing me thousands.

Mounting hardware is low quality.," I would only recommend this product if you really need to cut costs on a build and you are sure you are only going to install it once.  When attempting to mount this on a second board, one of the screws became fused when attempting to take it off, causing a long weighted chain of metal and plastic to be swiveling over the top of my chip while I had to use vice grips and a dremel to remove the offending screw.  Oh, and the posts that you install that sit on the underside of the bracket are flush & do not have any sort of screw head in them, so when you are trying to remove the top part of the bracket, it just spins and spins and wont catch on anything.Now that i had to repurpose some other hardware to get this to work correctly, it IS a good cooler.

Have used quite a few Liquid coolers in my builds and this one looked and felt like some the more expensive ones I have used.. But.., I installed this cooler in the top mount spot on my case. like so many other cases I have used.. it was designed for a radiator to mount above the mainboard in a Horizontal position.. The pump must not circulate the coolant well enough because my cooler spikes way up to 47 C playin simple games.. and the Noisy fans are enough to drive a person crazy.. I don't mean air flow I mean they rattle a lot.. I have figured out that laying the case on its side so the fans and radiator are vertical make everything run Cooler and the Fans don't rattle at all.. Thus my thinking that the pump is either weak in mine or under powered in general for a top mount build.. I am going to try a return and see if I can get a better unit to be sure its not just this one.. will post again.., ATM I would have to say no I would not recommend this product.. Spend a little more and get something a little better.. If this were my product I would increase the pump size a bit to be sure it could handle a top mount build..,3,4

Ran very cool at first and that is with the AMD FX 9590, a notoriously hot chip."," After 6 months, the pump failed.  I noticed the processor temperature running hotter and hotter until the processor reached a critical temperature and shut down to protect itself.  This happened repeatedly and when I felt the pump/hose region, it was quite hot but the radiator was cool.  I removed this cooler and put back the OEM water cooler that came with the AMD FX 9590, and the system is again working.

May bother some customers going for specific color schemes. Fits my Red/Black build however.," The fans that come with this cooler really pushes air well. Have them connected to a 4 pin PWM fan header on my motherboard and controlled through it keeping rpms down, only ramping up when needed. Actually bought other static pressure fans to replace the stock ones given my experience with Corsair AIO's. However they werent needed as the fans provided are great. So this cooler and fans are very quiet when connected to a fan controller or through MB fan header with a proper heat/rpm curve set. So far, temps on a FX-8350 overclocked to 4.5ghtz for a 24/7 OC hasnt gone beyond 40C.

I have never heard of this company. I saw the reviews on this and decided that I would bite the bullet and give this cooler a shot. I am amazed at this company and the product. The packing was very reassuring upon opening about LEPA. I immediately knew this was a great product. I inspected the radiator and it was in perfect shape. No fins bent, until I bumped it into the case while mounting. LOL. The fans appear to be good and solid. Very quiet. The water block is solid and sturdy. Mounting hardware was impressive. There was a reviewer that said the back bracket was close to the actual solder mounds. But...the package came with plastic sticker like protectors that somewhat protect the board. They did not cover the side of the plate which was close to the solder point so I put a little piece of electrical tape just as a precaution. I would rather error on side of safe then take a chance and ruin my board. The hoses are not cheap. they are firm but bendable. I wish my cars  heater hoses were of the same material. The Pump lights up red and looks nice when powered. The Cooling performance is phenomenal. With a zalman air cooler I hit 67c under extreme stress. at idle zalman hovered around 36c.This thing Stomped the living Crud out every other cooler I have owned in the last 19 years. I idle at 26c now. Ran prime 95 for about 45 min and It does not even break 60c. Ambiant room temp is at 72f. Around 40c the fans start throttling up and you can slightly hear them, but you really have to listen for them. This cooler is a BEAST. I will definitely continue buying LEPA products. Workmanship is Great, Quality Great. Watch out name brands, These guys are going to steal a ton of business.","  Not many cons at all. Only thing I would like to see change is the water block hose elbow is right up against, barely touching the ram. Yea I could have inverted it, But then the logo would be upside down and the hoses would be right in the rear exhaust fan. Also one other thing was the thermal grease, They definitely measured it down to the Grain cutting it close. If I bumped it while spreading it I might not have had enough. They could spare a small amount more I feel, just in case someone does smear a touch on a finger or something.  But, these cons I feel do not waver any loss of an egg. But its close, just like the thermal grease.", I am recommending this to my friends and family. Also will buy another for my wife's pc in a while. Good product. Instructions are doable.,2,3

It worked decent enough keeping the cooler then the stock fan with a lot less noise but the pump died in a year. Corsair replaced it but I decided to go with Air cooling with the EVO 212. Looking to upgrade my 2500K CPU to the newer i7 Octo-core I wanted to go with a Micro-ATX case so I wasn't cramped with a full size case under my desk but the EVO 212 was too big to fit so I went looking for a AIO water cooler again. The bigger Corsair unit was over $100 and I didn't want to spend that much but then I saw this LEPA unit reasonably priced at $75 with a rebate on top of that and had good reviews.Fast forward I got all the components and the install was easy with the hardware included. After installing the OS I checked the CPU temps and all six core were idling at 28c or less but the two radiant fans were really loud. I went into the BIOS and changed the fan profile to quiet reducing the fan speed to 600RPM. The fans were quiet now but the CPU temps would rise pretty quick due to the reduced fan speeds under load. I wanted to keep the rig silent so I bit the bullet and replaced the two stock radiator fans with two Noctua NF-F12 PWM Cooling Fans. Now my six cores idle around 21c and under a gaming load only reach around 35c with only no noticeable fan noise with the Noctua at 1000rpm. Quite impressive and highly recommended even with the stock fans (if you don't mind the noise).,1,1

On my FX-6300 machine, (MSI 970 board) I have clocked the CPU to 4GHz, and at idle, I run at 40C, under load it gets to the point where it thermal throttles at 75C. On the Intel side with my i5-3570k (Asrock Z75 Pro3 board) also clocked at 4GHz, it runs at 42C and crashes when under load. I have tried a few different things searching for the culprit of these bad temps. I ran the pump direct to the PSU, I have tried 3 different thermal pastes (Artic Silver 5, Arctic MX-4, and Cooler Master generic (All with negligible differences) ). Now when I compare this to my Hyper 212 Plus on the Intel PC (4.5GHz) I get 28C at idle, 60C under full load."," To clarify that I do understand what I'm doing, I have made sure the pump is working (LED is on, and you can feel slight vibration from pump). However this being said, I am new to water cooling so it is possible mistakes were made.

One of the plastic standoffs that was supposed to be fitted on a bolt that went through the motherboard had a hole that was too narrow to fit the bolt. So at first I tried hard to push it on, because it was the first one that I tried to put on, and got it about halfway down the bolt...and it was stuck...The other ones slid on just fine(except one was a bit too loose) so I ended up installing the cooler anyways to see if it worked, and surprisingly it actually did, except the bolt was sticking out on the other side of the mother a bit, which just proves how tightly the plastic standoff was stuck on it. I couldn't even really ask them for a new one because the set up was going through the mother board and case, and I had no way to separate it. So a few weeks later it was just bothering me that it was not on correctly, I ended up trying to pull the bolt and the stand off apart again. 2 hours later I finally did it, nicking my motherboard a few times in the process, luckily it still works fine. Then i spent another half an hour widening the hole on that plastic standoff using anything I could find. Now finally it works fine, but I shouldn't have had to put that much work into fixing a simple plastic stand off."," Just please work on quality control for all the pieces on the product.

N82E16835494019,35-494-019,12/15/2015 1:57:30 PM,Evan E.,Insane improvement from the Evo 212,5, I came from a push pull evo 212 configuration to this and I cannot emphasize enough how much more cooling power this setup provides. I have a fx 8350 overclocked to 4.7 with the 990FX UD3 board and would occasionally get temps in the the mid to high 60s while playing some intensive AAA games combined with my overclocked 290 producing crazy heat. With this cooler I am not getting over 48 degrees max and that is while running prime which my last cooler couldn’t even handle. I am basically getting 20 degrees cooler than the evo 212. I was able to overclock to 4.9 with temps in the mid 50s but don't like how much voltage I have to put in my chip so I am keeping it at 4.7. Additionally I lowered my fan curve significantly and now can barely hear the cooler compared to the Evo 212 under full load. I have always been skeptical of AIO liquid coolers but I had LEPA fans before that I loved and this was on sale for $55 with MIR so I said why not try. After installing and testing this cooler it just screams high quality so I feel very good about going with this brand over the more expensive corsair coolers.," Not really a con but these fans are insane, on max they push 103 CFM and are loud as you can imagine. In my setup at 4.7 they never get above 50% speed so I don't notice the noise but when I was testing prime and putting 1.54 volts in my chip these things are like NASA wind tunnels which helped keep the temps down in the mid 50s. I don't think there is an overclock setup that this cooler couldn't handle but you end up sacrificing chip life and quietness.", You will not be disappointed. LEPA is legit.,5,5

It's a night and day difference. The sound is nice and quiet and the cpu runs cooler. I like that it was easy to install (except the directions were hard to understand). The weird thing is the computer seems to perform better now that I have watercooling. The only thing I changed is the case and cooler. I'm thinking maybe because my cpu is now running cooler? I have a 5820k overclocked to 4.3, nothing too crazy. This keeps it nice and cool, it idles at almost 10 degrees C cooler. I'm sure under load the margain is even bigger, maybe up to 20-30 C cooler! Although thats speculation, I have not tested temps under load yet, because I know its doing its job already from the idle temps. I haven't had a problem with it. Like I said computer is more responsive overall and I'm thinking due to better temps.In the short time of using this, I can already tell, I would not go back to air cooling. Lets just hope it lasts because I think it is a great product. When I am using full cpu power for an extended time, like on a 4k video export, the fans do seem to rev up a little bit so I know its doing its job. It's barely noticeable but you hear the fans start revving up slightly to cool the cpu as exporting 4k is using maybe 100% power. Then when your done, it goes back to *almost* quiet. Pretty nice!"," - Obviously the biggest con is if any water ever leaked out of it, that would be pretty bad. Other than that I see no reason to not use water cooling.- 1 suggestion is to fix the instruction manual. Make it more easy to understand. The instructions took about an hour to figure out even though the steps were so simple. I didn't want to mess anything up so I kept reading the same 2 sentence paragraph over and over trying to figure out how to connect the fan cables! They didn't explain very well, how to connect the fans to your motherboard. That had me for a while. Turns out you have to connect the fan connecters to each other, then connect the big sata power connector to your power supply, and that will provide power for both. I couldn't figure that out. It looked like they were both supposed to go into 4 pin cpu fan power on the motherboard, but i didn't have enough connections. I was stumped until I finally realized they go into each other. lol. They should have explained that better. - One more small issue was I think the pump was making a very faint weird noise the first day I connected it. But it went away after the first day. Haven't heard it since. Maybe there was air in it or something."," I would recommend all corsair water cooling to anyone building a system from now on. I use my computer heavily so I bought the most expensive one (it was on sale on newegg) but I would prefer water cooling over anything else out there now. So friends that are building lesser systems I will still recommend corsair water cooling, just not maybe one as expensive.",2,2

I probably could go higher in OC, but this was a stock profile, and it was a battle to go over 4.0GHz until ASRock offered an upgraded BIOS and preset.  I bought a HUGE Thermaltake case.  I 1st mounted this in a pull configuration, and I had no issues other than my two 980ti's would throttle and, video would be unresponsive in heavy gaming sessions in 4K resolution.  I recently gave it a cleaning, and turned my fans around to a push configuration (out of top of rig), and it's a huge improvment.  I currently have no cooling issues overclocked at 4.2GHz.  I am happy.  The fans spin up pretty loud at times, but usually they are tame.  It's only under heavy gaming that they spin up loud.  Honestly, this was my first water cooling experience.  I was hoping I would have trouble free, no hassle 1st step in that direction.  This did not disapoint  one bit.  I was always leary of breaking a plastic nnipple on either end of the hose, so I handled it gingerly at all times.  It works good enough, so I can't complain.   I want to water cool the cards in the future, but that's another topic.  I think it's well priced, and works.  I recommend it."," Colors don't exactly match what's on the screen.

Specially in a push pull config.," - The pump starts making a grinding noise after a few hours of the system being on. - The copper plate on my unit isnt even flat, the middle protrudes outwards and it had a pretty deep scuff on the surface.- There is no way to have full PWM control of the pump, its either 50% or 100%, when other brands with the exact same pump let you set a curve or at least offer way more levels of control.- The unit doesn't hold the fan curves in memory, unless you link it to the liquid temperature, is one of the most un reliable and slowly rising temperature parameters. The processor can be running at 70C while the liquid barely crosses 32C. Usually in between 29-32C. Settings curves based off of this is a plain nightmare. - Tubing is way too stiff.- Not sure why Corsair changed the layout of the screws. In my Define R5, none of the standard 280mm screw holes match up. At first i thought it was the case's fault. But then i tried a H100i, a H240X and the Predator 280, all of which lined up perfectly with the screw holes.- Corsair really needs to start including extra screws. - With barely 2 weeks of use, the connection tips on the radiator seem to have these strain marks. Which really scares me and feels like it might snap. The tubing isnt even being bent much since the radiator is front mounted."," Im probably just going to return it, mainly because of the pump noise. The whole system sits silently, while the pump makes its weird grinding bubbling sound. Its just so annoying to see scratch marks next to the radiator mount holes, all because the they dont seem to be standard placement holes.",2,4

While there's a higher level of temperature consistency out of water cooling heatsinks, it's hard to justify the extra cost."," This was my first experience with water cooling in a PC, and while it wasn't bad, I really haven't found anything that would keep me from just sticking with a Hyper 212 Evo or something similar next time around. I could see this having a place in an x99 build that will be running intense loads where you're looking for a more consistent temp, but outside of that, I don't really see the benefit in a budget build.For the people who absolutely see the value in that extra 5-10 degrees, maybe want a little more consistency of temperature, or maybe are just going for a certain look, this definitely does the job. I can't say there's much if any benefit to using this on a locked i5 or lower, but if you're planning to get the absolute max overclock out of your i5 or i7, this might let you squeeze an extra 100 Mhz out of it.",2,2

I took their word for it, and didn't even open the stock fans included and used Thermalake Riing fans instead. Fans included don't look that nice either.UPDATE: There's the pump noise, which is fine, but now there is an almost buzz that is coming form the pump. I know it is the pump from testing.

It delivers excellent performance!,5," First off, I have done 100's of builds, and the ease of setup of this product makes it super simple to get things going.  Once installed it cooled my i7-6700k stock clocks well.  As I write this my resting temps are 21C, under full load with the latest p95 iteration, I have not seen it go above 42C.  Ambient air temperature is 78F in Florida.  Overclocked the temps rise to 47-50C.  I removed the stock thermal paste and added some arctic silver.  I have it top mounted which helps with temps greatly.  For those of you have temp issues, you may have mounted the block incorrectly (there is a reason why you tighten opposites), case may have temp hot zones, the area where you have your case has temp hot zones, etc.  For those looking to build with this, a piece of pro advice, if you want the best thermals, make sure all elements of the computing environment provide maximum circulation.  This is the one element that most people forget to take into account.  Would you build a server room that has no circulation and does not keep ambient temps manageable?  Fan noise not an issue, on low, it is almost inaudible, on balanced its noticeable but not unbearable.  No pump wine for me.  Some have complained about the fans, well, the beauty is you can change them out.  For me the fans are not an issue and move sufficient air to keep things cool.  Overall, very please."," The controls for fan speed can glitch sometimes, but that only has to do with starting up and keeping the same profile running.  I would suggest reinforcing the mounting screw hole areas, just for those who have no dexterity.  They might crack the radiator if they are not paying attention to how tight they screw things in.", Yes definitely.

As a water cooling enthusiast I have done my research on various AIO's in the past. This Corsair H115i is tops in my books as a great all round unit for the cost. Its super easy to install and get working as long as you follow the simple instructions and pay attention to detail.  I ran this on my highly overclocked AMD FX6350 4.5Ghz @ 1.400 vcore.  Loads were taken at the 1 hr point of prime 95 Stock cooler  40c idle 70c load at STOCK SPEEDS (only a fool would OC AMD on a stock cooler)Corsair H115i 23c idle and 42c loaded. The unit itself is great a nice big 280mm 26mm thick rad nicely sleeved tubing running to a pump/block combo, 2 140mm high pressure fans, and mounting hardware for AMD and Intel. be warned for AMD you will need pat of your stock coolers mount off the board. For Intel they supply everything. Installation for me was pretty straight forward as I have been water cooling my computers since well before it became the market it is today. Heck we use automotive heater cores for our rads back then and had to figure out how to mount them in the case and add fans on them.  Anyway installs pretty easy for even the novice persons out there. Fans are nice and quiet even under full blast any noise you should hear from them is airflow not  bearing whine. The pump/block combo is also just as quiet.  It even has a cpu plug that it used to monitor the pumps speed. This is not for powering it as some others have thought. The pump has a separate sata power plug for power alone as pulling the amps it need to run off the board is not advisable. Another neat feature with this is the ability to change the color fo the emblem on the pump/block to whatever you want to via the corsair link software, which also allows you to monitor the units speeds and adjust them if needed. I normally do not like included software with parts as I find most of them clunky and useless, this one however has alot of nice tweeks you can do to the unit itself.", I do not have any cons at all I simply loved this unit.," I'm water cooling junky thru and thru my main rig runs a fully customized water cooling solution. My back-up test rig however is not. Its just not practicable to do with all the changes it goes thru when reviewing parts, so I use the AIO or all-in-ones. My first one was a Deepcool Captain 240 that I reviewed some time back, and I was impressed with it just as I am with this Corsair unit. Overall the larger 280mm rad vs the 240mm rad showed an improvement in loaded temps.  So if your looking for a quick easy inexpensive way to lower your cpu temps grab this and dont look back. For the price it can not be beat.",1,2

9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,9/5/2016 6:28:57 PM,William F.,Good performing AiO cooler,4," The large 280mm radiator offers substantial cooling ability for even significantly overclocked multi-cored processors. My Intel i7-5820K (six core/12 thread) at 4GHz peaked at 70°C during burn-in testing on Prime95 for this review. In contrast, my previous unit, the Deepcool Captain 120 peaked at 76°C during the same test. Idle temperatures with the H115i are around 35°C for this unit, but that of course will vary depending on your own CPU, clock speeds and voltage, and cooling efficiency of your PC case. In contrast, idle temperatures with the Captain 120 were around 38°C.Corsair includes two 0.70 Amp - 140mm high pressure PWM fans. These are pretty capable fans, and should suffice for most applications. I did notice a fair amount of air bleeding from the fan shroud back into the case during the burn-in tests while the fans were near 100% power. So, for extreme overclockers, I would recommend changing them out and adding two more fans for a push/pull configuration. If it’s quiet operation you’re seeking, these should be good. Under low load, they are nearly and practically silent. Also, rest assured that if you don’t have available fan headers on your motherboard, the pump has two 4-pin fan leads that draw power from the pump’s power connector. However, be sure to read my cons below regarding the power connector issue.The H115i is compatible with a fairly wide range of motherboard/CPU applications for both AMD and Intel, and includes several backplates and standoff sets to ensure you have the right hardware.The H115i includes a generous amount of water tubing length, so doing a front-mount application should not pose too much of a challenge. However, it could pose difficult when trying to manage all that tubing when doing a top-mount install, which naturally locates the pump much closer to the radiator. The tubing is mildly flexible, and I felt myself hesitating to bend it into shape for fear of causing a leak on one of the fittings. But, everything seems to be fine and functioning normally even with the tight squeeze.The waterblock/pump unit is pretty massive. Much larger than the unit included with the Captain 120. This must be because of the small amount of circuitry necessary to provide USB connectivity from the pump to the motherboard, in addition to the LED backlight components. On the plus side, the large waterblock provides superb coverage on the fairly large lid of the Haswell-E processor.Corsair provides a 5-year, non-transferable warranty on defects and workmanship. I did note some minor cons below regarding the warranty."," When installing the cooler per the included instructions, it advises you to connect the pump power connector to the CPU_FAN header on the motherboard (instruction item 5). THIS IS NOT CORRECT! In fact, the pump gets its power from a SATA power cable that you must connect to an available power supply SATA connector. Failing to connect the SATA power cable will result in the pump not running, potentially causing overheating of your CPU if overlooked. The documentation makes ZERO mention of this SATA connector, and it makes no appearance in any of the diagram figures.In my opinion, the weakest link of this product (no pun intended), is the Corsair Link software utility. I found that Corsair Link is almost completely redundant compared to other third party freeware for hardware monitoring and statistics. It definitely offers no real benefit over my existing MSI motherboard BIOS and Command Center menu’s settings and capabilities. So far, the only unique setting that it allows me to do is change is the LED color on the Corsair pump unit. I hoped that the Link software would at least tie into the existing Corsair Utility Engine that I’ve already installed for my K70 keyboard, but it does not. Perhaps, Corsair should wrap all of these individual utility programs into one all-inclusive piece of management software. When I said the radiator was large, I meant it. At 280mm (2x140mm), the vast majority of PC cases cannot house this cooler. Those that are compatible with water cooling units are typically designed for 120mm and 240mm units, while some can manage a 360mm (3x120mm) unit. The 280mm radiator is just a whole different product, and I hope you do your homework before purchasing to ensure your current or future PC case is compatible.The H115i waterblock came with pre-applied thermal paste in a circular shape over the somewhat polished copper contact surface. The shape was about the size of a quarter, which was not sufficient enough to cover the lid of my processor. After mounting the unit, and then removing it shortly thereafter, I discovered that much of the CPU lid was dry around the edges and corners, and thus was making no contact to the waterblock. I decided to wipe the block and CPU clean, and apply Arctic Silver 5 thermal paste onto the CPU lid, and then re-install the cooler. I feel better knowing that the entire CPU lid has good contact with the waterblock now.The third paragraph in the warranty guide document specifies that this 5-year warranty applies to a Corsair power supply.

I recently helped a friend build a custom loop with a 6850k, and I'm happy to report that the H115i has cooling performance that isn't too far behind much more expensive solutions. That is, after obtaining a 6850k for myself, the H115i performed nearly as well as my friend's custom loop - save for the noisy fans.

Not a big deal as i just use the software for watching the pump RPM and radiator fan curve."," I would for sure recommend this to anyone just getting into overclocking/watercooling.Also, if you have been using a tower style air cooler - you may see higher VRM temps after switching to this - as there is not as much airflow over them.

The backplate on this is very flimsy and doesn't make the cooler sit flush against the CPU.  Luckily I had some rubber washers that came with my computer case.  I installed these on the backplate and now it is sitting corectly...- Corsair Link software is not very good.  It constantly shows my fans as not working (even though they are) and doesn't give an accurate reading of the CPU temps.  I didn't know that the cooler wasn't seated correctly, and ran some thermal tests while gaming using other software.  If I had relied on the Corsair Link software, I would have thought my CPU was running at a cool 32 degrees.  Instead of the 90 degrees it really was running at!  After seating the cooler correctly with the backplate fixed, I haven't had any problems, but I still won't rely on Link to inform me if there's something wrong.  It does, however, help with the fans.  If I keep them in balanced, my temps stay down and so does the noise."," If you're going to be buying this, I would recommend some rubber washers.",None,None

9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,8/30/2016 8:46:55 PM,Anonymous,Great intro to water cooling,4," I am pretty impressed with the cooling capabilities of this liquid CPU cooler.  Right off the bat, I saw my full CPU load temps drop 21C from my previous after market cooler (56C -> 35C) (pump and fans at full speed).  More on this in the other section.Aside from the drastic drop in CPU temperatures, the device is not too bad on the installation.  I am using this cooler on an AMD processor, everything was included for both AMD and Intel, but the Intel bracket is installed by default.  To install this for an AMD processor, you simply need to rotate the mounting bracket on the pump with one that is included in the bag.  After that, replace the plastic mounts for the stock heatsink with the included stand-offs.  Once that is done, 4 thumb screws and the pump/heatsink is now mounted.So far as aesthetics go, it looks pretty well.  Most everything is black so it will fit many many color schemes.  The LED light on the pump is also customization and can be any RGB color.  So no matter the color scheme of the case, the cooler will match.  The color can also reflect the temperature of the CPU when it crosses a single threshold.  What would be neat is if it gradually changed from one color to another based on temperature, but alas it cannot.  It can only change from one color to another in one step based on the CPU temperature.The USB connection for the Corsair Link is one that connects directly to the USB header on the motherboard.  This is good in that it does not require the cable to connect outside the case and then run back in.  However, this does mean that it will waste one of your USB headers inside the case. (Motherboard headers for USB have 2 ports per header, one will be covered by the Corsair Link connection and the other port will be left connected to nothing).  If you had a memory card reader or some other internal device that only used one USB header, you could combine the devices into the same header without much grief.  This would be great if for example your power supply also had Corsair Link.  The USB connection on the pump itself if simply a USB mini connection, so there are a lot of options available to you."," First con, is the fan and pump profiles don't seem to be saved in the pump itself.  For example, if I max out the fan and pump speed, it will do as I ask and crank up the RPMs.  However, if I reboot these preferences are not used.  It is not until Windows boots (and subsequently Corsair Link loads), that the fans and pump max out again.Another strange thing is the pump only appears to have two speeds.  The lower speed is about 900 RPM and the other is about 1860 RPM.  Not much in between. In either case, I could not hear the pump much at all, so sound is not an issue with the pump.Next up on the complaints is the fans.  There is no shortage of complaints on the fans, but they do their job.  When they are cranked up, they are very loud but they also move a ton of air.  But my biggest problem with them, is that there is not a way to turn them off.  I cannot set a speed below 40% in the Corsair Link software (for the fixed percentage) and using a custom rule allows down to 25% (about 900 RPM).  Not sure if this is a limit of case fans, but it would be awesome to have no fans unless they are needed.On the mention of fans, I would also say that adding some RGB to the radiator/fans would be a nice touch.Final note, my pre-applied thermal paste had a bit of cardboard fuzz on it.  Be sure to inspect the pre-applied thermal paste for contaminates before mounting it."," Overall, I think this is great for people who want to get in to liquid coolers or even for those that have dabbled in it already.  I am very satisfied with this product and its ability to keep my cores cool.  Here are some very basic stats for my AMD Phenom processor with no overclocking (125W CPU).  CPU is under full prime95 load:Stock cooler:  65CAfter market air cooler:  56CThis product with lowest pump/fan speeds:  40CThis product with highest pump/fan speeds:  35CThis product with highest pump/fan speeds and CPU at idle:  25CThis was all with the pre-applied thermal paste. It is worth noting that at the end of the test, I tried some Arctic Silver 5 and saw no justifiable reason to need it.  The stock paste was sufficient.Final odd thing I noticed is the pump/coolant temperature.  I am not sure if it is my CPU that is lying to me or the sensor in the pump.  Either way, at one point it said my CPU was 25C and idle.  At the same time, it reported the pump/coolant temperature as 27C.  Looking at some basic logic here, if the heatsink is hotter than my CPU cores, it should be heating the processor.  At the same time, the CPU is still generating MORE heat.  It is impossible for something hotter to cool something colder than itself in a stable condition.  I allowed this to sit for probably a good 30 minutes with no temperature or load fluctuations and the temperatures never reached an equilibrium and the pump/coolant stayed hotter than my CPU.  I could see this being the case if temperature from the motor in the pump was effecting the temperature, but then it is no longer a good measurement to use.",3,3

I am using it on a 6700k, and at stock speed it never goes above 42c, and at idle it stays around 22c. It also adds a nice premium look to my overall build."," There was an issue though. A couple months after installing it, the pump began to fail. I was just near my computer, no programs were running, and then I heard the fans ramp up, and the temperature was above 80c. I turned my computer off immediately of course. I realized that it was the pump, and from other reviews, I was worried about a long drawn out warranty process. That was not the case. The cooler failed on the weekend when Corsairs customer service was closed, but their system was quite intuitive. I was able to just enter a ticket on the issue, their system then processed an RMA for me, and come Monday I shipped the defective unit out.I chose the option for an expedited replacement, meaning that they will send out the replacement right away, but if the defective unit isn't back within 10 business days, they will charge you for it(although they do refund you once the defective unit has returned).I did not find this a problem, as it only took two days for the defective unit to be returned, and now I already have my new cooler just a few days after I requested the replacement."," Overall I love this cooler, It is nice to have the peace of mind that you are running a cool system.I know most people would probably dock an egg, because I received a defective unit, but I am not going too. There is no way for any company to stop all the defective items to slip through, but the fact that the warranty replacement was very fast and simple makes me feel very comfortable at the thought of continuing purchasing product from Corsair. I would most certainly recommend them.",4,4

I game for at least 3 hrs a night at when I get off to go to bed the temps have never went above 54c.   Thats of course according to corsair link which is a scetchy piece of software.

I'm not one to care much about noise, but if you crank the fans up they sound like one of those industrial floor fans.

Ran into an issue with the mastercase pro 5 fitting the two 140mm fans but not the 280mm radiator. I resolved the issue by buying 1/4in longer screws and the issue was more on my end making sure my case was compatible, but just something to keep in mind. - The cable placement seemed strange to me.

For the added noise and cost the H115i isn't really worth it. I ran tests using the thermal tape that comes pre installed, and an aftermarket paste.... neither showed a remarkable difference. The liquid cooler looks great inside the case, much better than the Noctua heatsink, and allows for more RAM to be installed (on the MSI Z97A I could no have four sticks due to the Noctua crowding the slots). Overall I wouldn't recommend this product, unless you desire the aesthetic or spacing advantages. This was my fist liquid cooler, and I'm not really sure what all the hype is about...",1,3

Be gentle with the metal cooling vent spreader as it can bend. You may need to wiggle it in and bend the tubes a little to fit it into a full tower even.

It has a mini usb for the Corsair link software, but you can tuck the wire in-between the valley where the thumbscrews and the cooler header connects to the Mobo, and loop the wire over the back of the motherboard.

The cooler was very easy to install into my full tower.    The hoses were flexible enough to easily install onto the CPU.     The cooler is very well made and for the price was well worth every dollar I spent on it.     See other for more details.   I also like the Corsair link to download and it monitors very well and takes care of everything for my computer for the temps and all of the other information helps me to evaluate my system., The fans that came with the cooler are not very good.      They are very loud and noisy when the load is put on the cooler.      I did not like the standard paste that came with it.," I would like to say that for my AMD 9590 CPU it idles about 30-35 C but I have yet to see what max temps it has gone to.      I have changed out  the standard fans and replaced them with 2- Noctua NF-A14 IPPC-2000 IP67 140x140x25 mm case fans and they do not have and loud noises, no vibrations, and is very quiet.   I have replaced the standard CPU paste with Arctic MX-4 paste from the 20 g tube and has lowered the temps with this paste.   I have also used the paste on my video cards and I have also notice lower temps on the cards but I am not sure how much it has lowered them by but at idle the temps are around 28-31 C.       This is a big cooler so if anyone has any trouble with installing this into a case is because they have not done the research into building a proper system.     To those of you that has had trouble with installation of the cooler or has had complaints about the rigid tubing or about the Corsair Link then I suggest you look at the bigger picture and to ask yourselves - does the cooler do the JOB?      I would have all of you do more reading and studying how the software and hardware of the computer when you build your systems.

They are REALLY loud and can be heard from other rooms.  (more on this below)- The Corsair link USB cable is put in a dumb position forcing you to have to route the cable all the way around the water block.  Fix this in the next model, Corsair."," This is the same exact unit as the H110i GTX Extreme.  Corsair has simply slapped new model numbers on their line in 2016.  (This information comes directly from Corsair).  So anything you've seen or read about the ""H110i GTX Extreme"" model will apply to this.While the fans are loud at max RPM, the good news is it is not necessary to run them there ever.  I have seen reviews from tech websites that suggest a 3-5 degree improvement from running them at max.  My own experience is in line with this.  I will gladly take a 3 degree increase in temps for silence because either way I am well under Intel's suggested max operating temperature.  I run my own customized fan curve, but even with the ""quiet"" preset, the cooling is far superior to most air coolers. BENCHMARKS:CPU: i5-6600k overclocked to 4.5 Ghz @ 1.26Stress Software: Prime95 28.9.1 large FFT (AVX instructions)Ambient (room) temperature: 75°F (23.8°C)Fan setting: QuietThermal paste: Noctua-NT-H1RESULT AFTER 10 MINUTES:CPU Package Temp: 80°C Delta over ambient =  57.2°CWater temp: 38°CAIDA64 Stress Test:Result:  57°CDelta over ambient: 33.2°CCONCLUSION:As you can see, these numbers are very good.  Prime95 (newer versions) use AVX instructions which are known to make Intel CPU's burning hot.  If I didn't have a water cooler, I wouldn't bother with Prime95.  The only way you'll see better temperatures than what this unit offers is with a full custom water loop (get ready to spend about $500) and even then a custom loop won't get you much better temps.  The price to performance of a good CLC like this one is much better than a custom loop.  Custom loops perform slightly better but they are NOT worth the money if performance is all you care about.  This is especially true if all you want to cool with water is your CPU (if you need to liquid cool multiple graphics cards, then a custom loop is really the only option).  If you are an enthusiast and someone who likes to trick out their PC for aesthetic reasons, then sure go right ahead with your custom loops.  My only point here is that a high-end CLC is just as good at cooling a CPU as any other solution.  This unit will also outperform all air coolers on the market including the Noctua DH-15's.  It won't be a huge difference, but you will see a couple degree improvement all the while getting a much more aesthetically pleasing look.  Some people may like hanging a huge chunk of metal off their CPU (that makes removing your RAM impossible), but I don't.  I prefer to hide that chunk of metal away in my case as you can do with these CLC radiators.And finally, I would like to make a quick note about the thermal paste that comes on the cold plate of this unit.  It is very good.  I used it for a while and ran numerous tests.  I then swapped out that paste for my own (Noctua-NT-H1 which is one of the best pastes on the market).  I then ran the same tests and noticed the temperatures were exactly the same to the degree.  So, in my opinion, don't even bother buying new paste for this unit.  If you have some laying around and want to use it, sure.  But don't run out and buy some more.  The paste on this unit is very good.",8,8

N82E16835181103,35-181-103,1/21/2017 12:55:31 AM,Mark B.,Corsair H100i V2,5," I decided to wait a few months before writing a review to make sure it worked properly.  As of now, I've had the cooler for 4 months without any hiccups (hopefully I don't jinx myself lol).  Like most, I've tinkered with different placements in my case, tried different fan mounting options, etc.  After 4 months of using and abusing it, I've come to the conclusion that this is a solid AIO.  - First off, this thing keeps my CPU pretty chilly, even under the harshest of loads.  I do a fair amount of video editing and after an hour of rendering (4K with color correction), it barely creeps above 60c without having the fans run at max RPM. I have my fan curve to run around 1800-2000rpm at the most.  - Like most, I try to keep my rig as quiet as possible, so my fans don't even ramp up until 50-55c.  Currently my fans are running at 840rpm and my cpu is idling between 27c-31c.  Not too bad for a somewhat overclocked CPU.- With the most important part out of the way (performance), I have to say this cooler looks pretty spiffy as well.  The RGB option is pretty awesome.  If you have a case with a side panel and you're shooting for a particular color scheme, the RGB will help you to like it even more."," Most of these are just me nit picking and aren't worth deducting an egg.- First and foremost, the fans can get pretty loud at full RPM (almost all fans do, so it's to be expected).  If it sounds like a swarm of bumblebees are sitting next to you after hooking it up, I recommend downloading Corsair Link and setting up a profile.  You can mess with the presets, but even those are a bit loud, even if you're just browsing the web and not doing anything to stress your CPU.- Next, I wish the silver strip on the side of the radiator was detachable so I could set it upright.  OCD fits, man lol.  My hoses were touching my exhaust fan, so I flipped my radiator (the hoses are now on the right side).  Once flipped, the silver strip on the radiator that says Corsair is upside down.  Once again, nothing serious, just nit picking."," Couple of things I've learned along the way.- One of the most important things you can do with this cooler is become familiar with the Corsair Link software.  For the first month I had my cooler, I made the noob mistake when configuring my fan curve of grouping it with the H100i pump.  I won't say don't do that, but if you feel the need, make a separate profile for it and focus on the CPU.  Make sure when messing with your fan curve to group it with the CPU Package.  For the first month I had it, I was a little disappointed, as I was still hitting 70-72c.  Not terrible, but definitely nothing to brag about.  The moment I set my fan curve to group with  the CPU Package and not the H100i pump, my temps went from 72c to 62c (62c with the fans still RARELY hitting 2000rpm).  The fan curve is crucial to obtaining the performance you're seeking and something you'll just have to play with and figure out what works best for you.  All in all, this cooler is solid.  The fans are solid, they're just loud above 1800rpm.  Do I regret buying this? No.  Would I recommend it to someone? Absolutely.

It only goes from one solid color to the next. I wish the corsair can make a firmware update to enable this ability like the h100i has. If so, I will update and give 4 eggs.",,1,8

I would suggest installing the rad first before the block.Blocks comes with pre-applied thermal paste.Only requires one 3 pin fan header to power everything. Includes the USB cable for corsair link which lets you manage fan and pump speed and block led color. You can just let the block/pump itself manage the speed of the fans as the block / water heats up.Using a 5820k overclocked to 4.5ghz I got 32C idle and load temps were around 73C with stock pump/fan settings which is pretty good considering that chip outputs a ton of heat.5 year warranty which is great and tells customers that corsair will stand behind their product even after years of being discontinued.", The braided cables are pretty stiff and a bit hard to manipulate into position.A bit hard for cable management with three wires coming out of the unit.Fans can get pretty loud.Could have came with more long rad screws for push pull option.," This model is simply a rebranded h100i GTX. There really is no reason to upgrade if you already have one. Those looking to get an aio just get which ever is cheaper.Corsair link is a bit of a mixed bag, sometimes its good and actually works, other times it just crashes or plain won't work correctly.Overall this is a great AIO, its look great in a windowed case coupled with the performance and warranty, you really can't go wrong with this unit.",1,3

I am using Fractal Design Venturi HP Series 140mm fans in push pull with a Phanteks P400 case. I temporary overclocked my Core I7 6700k to 4.8Ghz @ 1.38v and tested with ROG RealBench for a hour.  Temps never got above 74*C and hovered mostly in the mid 60's. I did this on an Asus Maximus Viii Formula. Overall I am very pleased with the results., If I have to find something to complain about it would be the mess of wires coming off the block that you somehow need to make look good. The Corsair Link cable is on the bottom and points toward the back of the board making it difficult to route. Would have been better if it was on top and went straight out. Others may not find it as bad thing depending on the mobo and other factors.," I didn't use the stock fans so I cant comment as to their abilities. I'm sure they will work just fine. I also removed the factory T.I.M. and replaced it with Arctic Silver 5. Theirs is probably perfectly fine, but for an extra $5.00 why not make sure you have the best. I also used the Arctic Silver Arcticlean Thermal material Remover & Surface Purifier. This is another great product. Very pleased with the product.

Processor temps stay ice cold regardless of what I'm doing- No bulk space taken up by air fan radiator above processor (you don't really gain anything with the space savings though)," - It was difficult to mount took me awhile (over an hour) to figure out how to properly assemble the bracket for this specific processor and mobo. Instructions were confusing. Then the worst part is attaching it correctly to the mobo. Just a giant headache that makes me never want to disassemble this thing for any reason.- A little expensive as cooling options go overall when compared to a basic air cooling radiator that might have been way easier to mount on this build- After around 1 month of usage I started getting a constant rattling noise from the water pump. If I had to describe how loud it is now I'd say it sounds like a big fish tank pump blowing bubbles at full blast next to your year. At first I thought it was a dying or damaged fan so I called them about it and Corsair was very nice about shipping me a replacement fan. I switched the fan out with both the one they mailed to me AND a friends fan that I knew didn't make any noise at all when rotating. Rotated the radiator around in all axis for a few minutes as youtube vids will tell you to do to ""get air bubbles out"" (which is nonsense and a big waste of time there's no air bubbles in there to get out and that's not what causes the rattle). Remounted everything as instructed with liquid tubes at the bottom. 2 hours fiddling with it wasted and nothing worked still getting a constant rattle noise from the pump unit and have now confirmed it's not the fan.Apparently a google search after the fact tells me that many people have this issue with varying degrees of success fixing it. The pumps make a clicking noise to carying degrees that's how they pump the liquid. I just had no idea it was so loud! Happens with every liquid cooler not just the H90. Anyway, I feel like I've wasted enough time on it now and I refeuse to totally dismount, return, and clean the processor then remount. That would take WAY too much down time and effort to fix this rattle and I'm honestly so angry now I just don't have the patience to go through it all so I can get a replacement unit that will just start rattling again in a months time. Guess I will have to deal with a noisy PC for the next 4 years. That being said this is the first and LAST time I'll ever be dumb enough to do a liquid cooler. I had a feeling it was going to be a dumb decision and yep... it was! Going to be air all the way from here on out. Too many headaches with these liquid pumps to justify the modest increase in cooling efficiency.", - Id suggest people stick with the air coolers lest you end up in my sad situation stuck with a build that took a ton of money and effort and now sounds like garbage thanks to this unit.

If you want a push/pull config you have to order more screws.," The thermal paste is applied to the heat plate in a circle rather a square, it is also extremely thin. On the last H110 GTX I installed it was applied in a square and slightly thicker. The thermals were better on that cooler by nearly 20C, but its hard to say what the deciding factor for that was. It was mounted to a 4790K overclocked to 4.6GHz.

I installed this in a Cooler Master CM690ii at the top. I have a i7-3820 and an Asus X79 Sabretooth motherboard. Installing at the top of the case means it covers the top connectors on the board, so make sure you have any fans or power cables attached (especially if you did some cleaning while you were in there). I had to remove the H100i v2 twice to seat the fan header for the H100i and a second time for the CPU power. Entirely my fault and not that of Corsair. Just be mindful of where your connectors are and to seat or re-seat any of them before installing the H100 iv2.This replaced the H80i v2 in my case and has done an amazing job! Idle temps with the H80i v2 were 35˚, running 3D Mark 11 & 3D Mark they maxed out at 71˚. With the H100i v2 idle was 30˚ and max during 3D Mark was 56˚. Impressive drop under load, I see the same thing when gaming in BF4 or The Division, CPU temp hasn’t crossed 56˚ yet.Impressive performance with the H100i v2, it makes me want to overclock this CPU again to see what I can gain from it.

N82E16835181103,35-181-103,1/13/2017 2:13:33 PM,Peter L.,Cooler and quieter than my original Corsair H100i,5," Easy to install in my NZXT H440 case.Beats my original H100i temperatures on an overclocked i7-6700K @ 4.6GHz by ten degrees when under load (70C vs 80C). Admittedly the older cooler is about two years old, but it's still a substantial improvement.It also runs quieter, both at idle and under load. I suspect this is due to an improved pump design (since I was using the same Corsair Quiet Edition SP120 fans on each), and the fact that the pump speed is variable in the new model. When set to Quiet Mode in Corsair Link it is barely audible.Looks are attractive, especially the braided hoses, though I think the pump is more attractive in the original model as the LEDs stand out more with the Corsair logo.Corsair Link software is much improved over early versions, with customizable display of system temperatures and pump LED color."," Corsair name on radiator is upside down when mounted with the hoses to the right, though it is hidden behind the top of my case so no big deal.The screws to mount the fans to the radiator are slightly too long and hit the metal tabs protecting the radiator before they can fasten the fans tight. I managed to find some 3mm thick rubber washers to take up the slack, but this could have been a major annoyance if I didn't have any. If Corsair cannot source any screws of suitable length, they could at least provide washers with the kit."," I was so impressed with this AIO cooler's performance, especially when compared with its predecessor, that I am awarding it five eggs and ignoring the minor Cons. When I took off the overclock and ran at stock speeds, it stayed in the low 60s on my load test even on the Quiet setting.

I installed this in a Corsair Obsidian 450D case with an AMD FX-8350.  I received this unit as an EggXpert review item.The 450D case had plenty of room for this install.  I mounted the big 280mm radiator in the top of the case with the two 140mm fans pushing through the radiator and out the top.  I had a big Zalman air cooler in there before this which had it's motherboard back plate but the H115i requires the stock AMD backplate.  Keep this in mind as it took me a while to locate the stock AMD one.  The instructions were straightforward and I had no issues.  The tubing has a nice wrapping but seems really stiff.  I was able to make some minor adjustments but I was having to apply enough force when trying to bend that I felt anxious that was going to pop something.  It held up just fine, no leaks. ;)I installed Corsair Link 4.  All reported temps seemed on par with other monitoring.  Offers customization of the block's LED, pump and fan speeds, everything.  I was also able to monitor real time power usage of my Corsair power supply which was nice.  I initially had an issue with the software where after several hours it would start maxing out a single core on the CPU.  The process would just be going 100%.  After quite some time a recent update had cured this for me.  Performance is rock solid and this could handle much more then my 8350 can throw at it.  Stock I am idling around 29 C.  With all 8 cores maxed with Prime95 I could not get it to go above 47 C.  I had set the curve in the software to kick up pump and fan speeds at 50 C and it never did.  Quiet and did not seem to break a sweat.  I gave the CPU a modest overclock from 4GHz to 4.3GHz and I noticed ZERO change in temps.  As I said, solid.I really like what Corsair has done the last few years with nearly their entire product line.  I love this cooler but it will be overkill for most users.  A more compact 140mm radiator is plenty for all but the hottest setups.  If you have the room though it is a darn sexy piece of kit that installs easily and performs wonderfully.

N82E16835181103,35-181-103,1/11/2017 10:33:33 PM,Anonymous,good reputation confirmed,5," Based on the info from online forums and my own analysis, this AIO liquid cooler is a rebadge of the H100i GTX, just like most of the other H--i/V2 variants are the rebadge of their numerically corresponding GT/X counterparts, with no changes to performance and almost no exceptions. Both the original versions and rebadged versions have easy to find reviews on the internet.The performance is very good for units like this, with idle temperature of expected 30C and max temperature of 46C, just like in the reviews, depending on the ambient temperature. However, this performance is not too far off from the numerous competitors.The PWM based on USB Corsair Link is very responsive since the noise levels are sensitive to it. The noise levels are fairly tolerable, but not nearly the best, just like in the online reviews.The build quality is one of the best and installation is one of the easiest. The cable management is also one of the easiest, requiring only one 3-pin CPU fan connector. The radiator is basic and is same as other units made by other companies, but more dense than the ones in Swiftech, etc.Corsair Link software and website are very easy to use. They have been refined with several updates but very little functional change except with customizable LED tied to cooling performance.The warranty is five years and the quick installation guide is very simple to use.The LED light tied to the CPU pump looks very good to me, and the color can be changed in Corsair Link to anything besides the default white color, with a temperature warning color threshold of the default and changeable 45C.The fan performance is above average, not the best.The price has been reduced to be more reasonable.The packaging is what you would expect from a basic liquid cooler."," The acoustic levels cannot be optimized by Corsair Link, contrary of what you read in the reviews.  Each Corsair link component requires its own internal USB2 connector, but most motherboards only have two of them. You will need to spend another ~95 dollars for the hub. This cooler is not expandable but this is outweighed by superb performance and compact design compared to older customizable solutions."," H100i V2 is made in China, just as expected. Corsair is an american company in California that do both rebrands and original design. For me the noise level is just as important as cooling performance. If you don’t know already, the noise level is comparable if not more than air coolers due to additional pump noise. The larger fans have better noise levels per CFM. Liquid cpu cooling is not designed for compact and mobile PC’s, which are becoming the norm nowadays, with only specialized computers survive after tech convergence.",2,3

The fans power cable is SUPER short, to the point that I bought another fan and made it push/pull just to get the original fan cable to reach my motherboard, At least it dropped my temps by another 3C  but keep in mind I built a MINI iTX build, connecters are never far away.

Installed on intel i7-6700k but not overclocked. No stress temps are around 26C and under load temps hover around 46C.," -Installation instructions are insufficient.  I had to look up a youtube video to aid me which can be problematic if you don't have a computer since you're building a new one, as was my case.  Youtube on a smart phone saved me.-When snapping the cooler into the holding bracket a piece of excess plastic flew off and landed smack dab into the middle of the thermal compound. After much painstaking precision with a needle I was able to dig it out but it still messed up the thermal compound. My suggestion is when you perform this step have the cooler facing down so if any particles fly off they just go towards the ground and not up into the air, i.e. use gravity to help prevent contaminating the thermal pad.-Mounting options are limited if installing in anything other than a Full ATX due to the size of the radiator.  Take this with a grain of salt since this is case dependent and I have a  Fractal Design Define R4 Mid ATX. Could only be installed at the rear vs. the top or front of the case.", -The real reason for the 1 star review was the rebate that was offered by Corsair.  I bought this when there was a $20 rebate being offered which swayed me from several other comparable products.  I was building a new computer on a budget and was using rebates where I could to keep the cost down.  I have submitted numerous rebates over the years and submitted several with my new PC build and have never had a submission denied until this one. They stated that the UPC I submitted was invalid for the rebate. I would buy it if they say they never received the UPC but they received it and said that simply the UPC number was incorrect.  The only error I made was not photocopying the UPC as proof but even then they still have all the power and can still deny the rebate.  The only power we have as consumers is to spread the word when companies don't honor their rebates.  So be wary of any corsair rebates and don't use those to factor into your purchasing decision.The product works but I would not have bought it if I knew the rebate was not going to be honored.,9,15

That one uses metal screw holes which kind of float inside the plastic back plate. This causes them to spin around in the plastic when you try to take out the screws making it extremely difficult to remove. The new one however is all one piece so the screws can’t get stuck and makes it way easier to remove. Performance benchmarks listed below:Corsair Hydro H100i v2 (2 Fans)•	Idle Average:	82 °F•	Load Average: 	158 °F•	Ambient: 	72.2 °FPhanteks PH-TC14PE_BK 140mm (3 Fans)•	Idle Average:	79 °F•	Load Average:	162 °F•	Ambient: 	72.6 °F," Required a lot of effort to get it installed into a Corsair Carbide 300R case as the 4+4 pin CPU power cable, a heatsink for the motherboard and the memory were all in the way. If you want this cooler in this case, I suggest you do a lot of planning to make sure it will fit as it is really tight.Assuming the water block is installed in the correct orientation, with the Corsair logo being legible and not upside down, the right angle mini USB connector is angled the opposite way that it should be. Why would anyone want it pointing towards the back of their case where there is literally no easy way to cable management it and get it out of the way. It should point towards the front of the case where in my case I have cable management holes where it could quickly disappear. In the Corsair Link software, the pump controls only have two options, either quiet or performance mode, why is there no custom option? For the fans a custom fan curve can be set but not the pump, which is just as if not more important. Basically this means that when a game or another high CPU intensive application is not running the pump has to be manually changed to quiet mode or vice versa. This needs to be changed. The hoses were very hard to maneuver if you have a smaller case as the braiding on the hoses makes them very strong to prevent kinking but does hinder mobility."," Overall this cooler offers excellent cooling performance over even the best air coolers at a noticeably quieter volume. Assuming it will fit in your case, I would highly recommend this AIO on any system, unless your case has room for the even better Corsair H110i.

Temps are noticeably lower even before the thermal paste has broken in. It's quiet, indeed, but the biggest pro for me is the amount of space it saves in the case(I previously had an Arctic Freezer Pro, and while it was a great air cooler, it blocked one of my ram slots.)", No complaints yet. Corsair puts out great products.," I mounted the radiator on the rear of the case and oriented the fan to intake air. I'm not sure why anyone would mount the radiator in an exhaust configuration. Passing hot air over the radiator coils, from inside the case, seems counterproductive to me. I do lose an exhaust fan, but I also lose the huge heat sink in the middle of the case which should promote better air flow from my other fans.For the install, I had to remove the motherboard. Some people may get lucky, but my case(Thermaltake Element G) didn't quite give me access directly behind the processor, which is needed to secure the mounting hardware. Installation would have taken about 10 minutes otherwise. Quick and painless.",0,1

Needless to say, none of that worked. The RMA process has been going on for 21 days, which wouldn't necessarily be a problem if the responses were within a reasonable amount of time. The responses are taking between 5 and 6 days via email and each about as helpful as ""did you try giving it a stern look?""

I singled out this cooler specifically the reviews I read placed it as the quietest. I don't want a computer that sounds like the turbopumps on the space shuttle spooling up, and some liquid coolers have GREAT performance ratings, at the expense of ridiculous noise levels. I worked in air conditioning enough to watch the fan blades of condensing units evolve from crude rectangular paddles to highly computer-designed scythe-shaped masterpieces of quiet air movement, and I look for that in my cooling fans.I don't want to feel like I'm playing an industrial vacuum cleaner.The radiator and fan so well matched my Thor case. Neat installation.The fan can push or pull through the radiator. I chose pulling through to exhaust air out of the case.The Rosewill Thor case is fed by two giant 230mm fans. I took the 140mm fan from the back of the case and secured it in the floor where it also intakes air through a filter.So, the case has the top 230mm fan and the back radiator/140mm fan flowing air OUT, while the twin 230's and single 140 bring air IN.If I ever found that the air flow was too warm to adequately cool the CPU ( I have a 980 Ti nVidia video card that uses far more power than the CPPU) then can just flip the radiator fan around and draw in cooler air from outside the case, and pressurize the case even further.Considering the vast airflow of this case, I doubt that will become necessary.The amount of space taken up by the better CPU air-cooling fans is just, to me, excessive, and might have made it so I could not shut the case.With this unit, the cooling block/pump is so small that you can use all the RAM your motherboard can take, and you can even use the tall-heat-speader RAM or the RAM with a cooling fan mounted on it.", None," I will never air-cool a CPU again, I think.",2,2

And yes, it's caused by the Kraken X61, because once I remove it, the keyboard lag is gone. The keyboard lag is only there for about 1 or 2 minutes when booting into Windows (10).When I just received the item, I at first thought it was my PC and hardware. But I upgraded everything over the year, so it's not that. I also suspected it was a driver or the CAM software, however after several updates, it's still there. I also reinstalled Windows, used different USB ports. No luck at all. The lag is always there and persistent. Very annoying. Now upon a fresh boot, I first do something else, because the computer is unusable for 1 - 2 minutes.Also the led color on the CPU block is a joke. colors are really off. White seems impossible to achieve or only with a blue or yellow taint.Furthermore; support is slow. I created a support ticket with NZXT.

Now they want proof and that I have to create a video of the lag? Okay. Don't know how, but I will try.Furthermore; NZXT asked me where I installed the X61 Kraken? Sorry, but is this some kind of joke? Obviously I installed it in my PC and mounted it on my CPU. Where else should I have installed it, on the roof of my house? On our television? Or wait, maybe I should have mounted the Kraken X61 on our dog. Sorry, but that's really a dumb question.

One of the included fans seemed bad too. One was near silent but the other made a bad grinding noise. It'd also be super nice to be able to remove the fan connectors from the pump. All my USB headers are taken up so I wasn't going to use the Link software. That means I was going have my motherboard control everything but I still had to route that useless cable somewhere.Also I don't know if the provided screws are too long or the holes weren't drilled right but I couldn't completely tighten some of the fan screws. It just kinda feels like QC wasn't a massive priority on this."," This was my first liquid cooler. I was super excited to get it. That excitement waned pretty fast once I started messing with the fan controls on the motherboard. It did drop my temps by a fair amount but the noise just wasn't acceptable. Even with the bad fan, I would have gladly swapped the fans out. The pump just negates everything though. It's so much louder than everything else, and I have a blower style video card.I pulled it out and put my Noctua NH-U14S back in. It may run a few degrees warmer but it is SOOOOO much quieter. Besides, it still keeps the CPU well within safe temps under load and that's with the fans at sub 50% speeds.Here's the thing though. If I had started with this cooler, I probably would have been OK with it. My recent obsession with quiet cooling though, it probably would have been pitched for something else.

The problem is a loose plastic cover protects it. When i opened the box it was already off and a small section of the thermal paste had been rubbed off already. I fixed it but they should make a cover that snaps  on to it to protect it until you are ready to install it. Also the back cover for the bottom of the motherboard is a cheap plastic piece. Not very impressive when you compare it to the rest of what you get with this. It gets the job done but still., This thing is big! I have a Rosewill thor 2 case and it just fits nicely. Make sure you have a large case. Also keep in mind it is recommended you use the fan as an intake for the radiator. That means switching another fan to an exhaust.,1,1

Products of this nature are a must for overclocking and a must for high end CPU's which run extremely hot. The five year warranty does provide some peace of mind but its hard to overlook the computer downtime, the irritation of RMA's and re-installing the product."," The Corsair hydro series H90 is capable of cooling your rig however the only persistent factor that prevents me from indorsing Corsair as to a must buy is that for some reason the units begin to produce what can be best described as a knocking sound resonating from the pump unit when under load. I initially purchased the H80 and had to return it within a week because of the knocking sound it made. It was replaced with a new one of which I have used for about two years without any problems then about a month ago that irritating knocking re-surfaced. That brings me to present day with the H80 gone for RMA ( will pass down to my other computer) and the newly purchased H90. Guess what? I installed the H90, ran it for about an hour and that irritating knocking sound has reared its ugly head again. It must be an ongoing quality issue that hasn't been properly addressed. I will give it a few days then probably return. I would also point out that the fan supplied with the unit is inferior to many of the fans available as after market purchases.",,1,4

Not really a big deal, but I miss having the sleek line of lighted fans.- The tubing is extremely flexible (you can twist it 180 degrees without any angular bending of the tubes) it doesn't feel delicate or prone to rupturing during installation.  So if you have a mid size chassis, if you need to muscle it in, you don't have to worry much about breaking it before you get a chance to fire it up.- The coolant used in the Hydro series coolers is a 50/50 mix of propylene glycol and water, similar to the antifreeze in your car. You shouldn't need to worry about it cracking the unit because the coolant will not freeze unless it was like 35 degrees below zero.- The threading is pretty solid, and you will need to exert a little bit of pressure to fasten it to the case / fans to the radiator.- The pump itself uses RGB leds that allow for almost any color you would ever want. (but if you dont attach the USB Header to your motherboard, you don't be able to customize cooling performance, monitor coolant, or change the color of your RGB LED lighting.)- Price point seems pretty solid considering the design, construction, materials, features & aesthetics makes a convincing case for very high value.Update from first review:- Still running strong, no change in idle / load temps, the thermal paste is really holding its own.- No unusual hums, pump still works flawlessly.- CorsairLink software has some improvements, but is still far from mature.  I'm interested to see what other features they add down the line."," - READ THE INSTRUCTIONS about changing the Intel bracket if you have an AMD chipset switching the brackets was not 100% intuitive without referring to them.- Others have mentioned this, if you use AMD like I do, you'll need your backplate to attach the cooler. (Not a huge deal, but could be a deal breaker for someone.)"," - The H100i V2 is simply a re-branded H100i GTX with a few very minor tweaks. - These minor tweaks include replaceable color straps and the USB plug that attaches to the pump is removable and in a much better position to provide better cable management.- Please thoroughly inspect your radiator, tubes and all connections for a leakage BEFORE INSTALLING.- The fans were a little louder than I liked and weren't of the LED variety :P  SO I swapped them out with x2 Corsair Air Series AF120 LED 120mm Quiet Edition High Airflow Fans and my temps on average are 22-24c (these fans are about -15CFM from the stock fans btw)- You need to be very careful when tightening down the radiator to the case. DO NOT OVER-TIGHTEN!

I'm building my rig piece by piece as I can afford them (more on that later). Currently have a 6700K, 32GB of RAM, a power supply, and this AIO cooler in my system. I was able to boot from a flash drive to run memtest86 and left that to run overnight. I woke at about three AM to what sounded like a jet engine sucking air in the corner of my room. The pump had given out on the Kraken and all six fans in my case were going full-bore. I shut it down immediately and cracked the case open, and could feel the heat coming off the water block/CPU area without even touching it. Since I don't have a hard drive and operating system installed, I can't check to see if there's any lasting damage to the CPU yet.I called Newegg that morning, and even though I'd had it for more than thirty days (I'd only installed it after receiving the power supply two days prior to the catastrophe), they hooked me up with an RMA and had a new Kraken to me within six days. These guys rock.The new one works - thank goodness - and the UEFI shows the CPU correctly (here's hoping it's still in good shape). But the first time it powered up the pump made an awful racket, like there was air in it.

If anyone has had experience with Corsair's software with something like the H100i, then you will know what BAD software looks like.  CAD is not bad.  Yes there are better programs for system monitoring, and yes it's unfortunate that the manufacturer requires you to use THIER software, but its not as bad as some make it out to be.  The interface for CAD is pretty simple and i just use guest mode to keep from having to log into it and i dont see any exessive tasks or load on the cpu from CAD.  One last note, you will need to go into your device manager and manually tick the box that tells the board to kill power to the usb header when the pc is off.

Make sure your case has 140mm fan mounts, preferably on the back panel next to the I/O as this spot is usually worry free.

If you think to yourself ""no problem I will just run the lines for the cooling block to the outside of the case"", the coolant lines are factory sealed and you will lose $100 as soon as you attempt to separate the cooling block from the coolant return lines, so running them to the outside is not a possibility, unless you cut a hole big enough for the block assembly to pass through.

First of all, while it clearly states on their website it is LGA 1151 compatible*, it was not compatible with my 'MSI Z170A Gaming M5' motherboard, or my 'GIGABYTE G1 Gaming GA-Z170X-Gaming 7' motherboard, both of which are LGA 1151 boards. Also, the way it mounts is with a plastic bracket that you're supposed to stick to the back of your motherboard with included double sided tape, then insert these little metal sockets into holes in the bracket. The plastic backplate is supposed to keep the sockets from turning as you screw into it, which it doesn't do at all because its made of cheap plastic. Also, the bracket is supposed to be off center by design, which looks silly, but most people wouldn't care. However what most people WOULD care about, is that the screws that you thread through the mounting holes on your motherboard, and into the installed metal sockets, simply do not line up. There is a good 15 millimeter offset from where the screws should be positioned, and as a result you can't mount the block. * bottom of the page under 'compatibility': http://www.corsair.com/en/hydro-series-h55-quiet-cpu-cooler"," Ended up using the classic 'zip-tie' method.

The H90 appears to be the ""black sheep"" in Corsair's line-up.  It does not even show up on their web-page with their other liquid AIO cooling solutions. I think the popularity of this form-factor will be increasing due to increased case support and superior cooling of a larger radiator, and the quieter 140mm fans.  Corsairs really needs to up their game if they want this unit to stay competitive.  At a minimum provide 2 matched fans and a real metal backplate.When installing, I would suggest just using your fingers instead of a screwdriver like Linus does in the accompanying video or you will end up rotating the nuts within the plastic back-plate.",1,1

This may also cause compatibility problems on some cases.Overall, I suspect this cooler works well on Corsair cases (I cannot say for sure) but I would caution against using it on cases from other brands, unless you can be sure the device will fit.",0,4

You won't be disappointed. In the time that I've had it, I don't think I've seen my CPU go past 38C. YMMVHowever, the mounting process is incredibly frustrating. Your experience will basically be; ""OK, now what do I do?"" *looks at instructions* ""OK, how do I do that?"" It's so frustrating.

Only 60 when using Prime95. The tubes were a comfortable length for my mid tower and easy enough to move around without feeling like they'd pop out from their fittings."," It's about as good as my Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus that I have lying downstairs, only a little difference in temps. 5C and up to 10C if I'm lucky and there's no dust in the H55. Supplied fan was chucked in a server somewhere hidden where it could obnoxiously spin away because it is not quiet AT ALL. Instructions... let's just say good thing I like puzzles and not using instructions. The pump isn't the quietest thing on earth and I can easily hear the slight buzzing of the pump, but it's quiet. Annoying, but at least quiet."," I can often hear bubbles in it, indicating that it wasn't filled enough. It sounds kinda cool though and freaks out friends who are trying to turn on your computer, so I didn't take that away from it. I'd recommend getting a different fan that is quiet and has enough static pressure to go through the radiator. You can manage a push/pull setup with the four supplied screws. Wish there were four more so it would be more secure, but it worked. Otherwise, it was a solid cooler and looks cool enough. It's the flashy way to enter the water cooling boat, the one someone would choose if they didn't care about price per performance. Get this if you want your case to look cool, not for performance.

The fans and pump run super quiet so long as you tighten the fans down really well and mount the radiator according to the instructions. The LED lighting is a nice touch as well, although it stays on even when my PC is off, but that's just a problem with the BIOS on my end that I have yet to fix. Installation was fairly easy as well. Just had to take my time to make sure everything was proper. I also cleaned off the included thermal compound and reapplied my own. You don't have to do this, I did because the glob that came on the cooler was slightly off-center. Also, I would take note of where the rad mounts in your case. In my case I have it mounted at the top, and the fans almost touch my RAM, so make sure you have room because this thing is massive.This cooler does an excellent job of keeping my temps down. My 6700K runs <30 degrees idle, and stays in the low 40s under load. Which is impressive to me because I live in a region where the daytime temps are usually around 100 degrees F, and the room I have my PC in has a higher ambient temp than the rest of my apartment because the AC doesn't flow well into it. One thing I should mention is that I had to switch the 3 pin connector on my motherboard from CPU FAN to CPU OPT in order for the pump to work. I have an ASUS Z170-A motherboard and the pump did not work at all connected to CPU FAN like the instructions said. So be on the lookout for that as well.

If you have a lot of heat, like I do, or live in a hot climate, liquid cooling is your solution. I overclocked my FX-8150 to a stable 4500mhz at a maximum operating temperature of 48C under load, a 25% theoretical performance boost with little to no heat increase from my former CoolerMaster Hyper 212. I got a stable 5Ghz in testing, but don't like running 1.45v through the CPU as well as having to overclock the bus as this messes with my overclocked RAM speed."," Installation, installation, installation. The installation on this piece is an absolute pain and the smallest of improvements could have levied these pains. I opted not to use the Corsair prepackaged fans and instead went with two static pressure Noctuas. They are just a smidgen thicker than expected causing the mounting screws to be too short for easy installation. They hold well, but compress the rubber grommets more than I would like. Having an extra 1-2mm on the screws could have easily levied this.Additionally, the manual is subpar. The pictures barely represents the actual way to assemble and caused me (an experienced user) to reassemble the mounting bracket twice. Also, the backplate is only frictionally held in place and does not actually mount to the motherboard (AMD, not sure of Intel) during installation. This will make it more difficult to remove when changing processors or general cleaning.I also thinking the mounting hardware was cheap overall. Non-solid plastic for the backplate which could have easily been an aluminum plate at this price.", Why do high end products continue to come with a layer of cheap thermal paste that no end user worth their salt won't just wipe off?

Keeps my I5-2500k under 50c while overclocked to 4.7 ghz.I see a lot of reviews saying that it is loud.  I've had mine for 2+ years now and it's still working like it's brand new and I really don't hear the thing run at all.Other reviews mention it doesn't fit their case and bad egg it.  It not fitting your case is no real fault of corsairs.  It mounts to a standard 120mm fan slot.  If your case's side panel is really close to the 120mm slot you mount it to then the cooler will bulge out past the side of the case preventing you from putting the side panel back on.I solved that by mounting mine to the top center 120mm fan port in my case.Corsair can't possibly know the dimensions of every case on the market, so don't fault them for that.Other reviews mention the cooler not fitting their CPU slot and they have socket 1150.They see ""Universal Socket Comaptibility"" and think it means it fits every socket.  That was true when this cooler came out.  Socket 1150, 2011, 2011-v3, and 1151 came out after this cooler was made.If you read the description on Universal Socket Compatibility it clearly says: ""The Corsair Cooling Hydro Series H55 CPU Cooler features broad compatibility with Intel Socket 1156, 1155 and LGA1366, as well as AMD Socket AM2, AM3 and FM1.""So yes, this cooler does not support 1150, or 1151, but it tells you that in the specs/descriptions."," No real cons, but do keep in mind that the h55 is the baby cooler of the series.  If you overclock hard you will not be able to keep your pc on for more than 4 or 5 hours as the radiator on this cooler is not big enough to handle the heat for that long of a continuous period.

The problem was now that I have to leave my side panel off to allow the tubes to fit inside. I only have one fan turning also because the connector cables are too short to allow me to pass the other connector into the case to plug it in.

The unit looks sweet, but it dont fit. The mounting holes on top of the radiator do not line up with any holes on the case. I line one up, and the rest are off. I can drill the holes and make it fit, however the issues do not stop there. The fans mounted to the radiator are nothing less than poorly designed and placed. The forward fan over hangs my RAM and the only way to install the radiator/fan assembly is to remove the ram. However, the ram can not be reinstalled. The back fan over hangs the CPU power connection which also prevents proper mounting.

It would be nice to have included an extra set of screws. No updated instructions for 1150 motherboards. Though not obnoxiously loud I can hear the pump when the case cover is off, but only when I am within a foot or two. According to others that goes away after a short while. I'll monitor that to see if it gets any worse. If not then I can live with it."," I bought this cooler a few months ago on impulse because it was on sale. I was skeptical about water cooling because liquids, electronics, and electricity don't go together. However, as I suspected, once a better unlocked i5 or i7 processor came along I would upgrade from my i5-4670 (non-K). I upgraded to an i7-4790K and was not sure that my Noctua NH-L12 would be adequate so I broke out the H90. Right away I replaced the fan with a pair of Phanteks PH-F140XP_BK. I did a separate review on those. Suffice it to say that they are quiet and move a lot of air in push/pull config. Corsair only includes one set of screws so after searching around a bit I found that they are #6 32x1x1-1/4. I went to home depot and bought a set that was 1x1-1/2 because when I test mounted the radiator with one of the Phanteks it did not look like the 1-1/4 screws would be long enough to reach. It turns out that 1-1/4 is long enough. After the 1st day of use I took off the whole system to redo the cabling and discovered that the 1-1/2 screws had gone into the radiator fins and bent them. No problem though because the 4 points affected are tiny and did not affect performance. I added an additional washer so that there was no longer any contact with the radiator when I remounted the system. Now on to some numbers. Sitting idle the lowest temp. I've seen recorded by ""Real Temp"" is 23C. Typically though I see between 26C-29C. Under load/Gaming the highest temp. I've seen so far is 56C while playing Tomb Raider with Ultra settings and TresFX enabled. I could not hear the H90 over the my Gigabyte GTX 780 GHz Edition's fans, though I could feel a lot of hot air from the card being exhausted by the Phanteks.That's impressive. Mine is a Mini-ITX build in a Fractal Node 304 case. I haven't done an Prime95 stress testing yet but that's next. Perhaps tonight. I'll come back and update this review after I do that. Installation was relatively easy. The only problem I had was with the backplate. I'd read in other reviews that it fits 1150 motherboards but at first I did not think that it fit. It is plastic so it has enough elasticity to contort with out bowing out to get the pins into the mounting holes. I didn't use the foam pads that are supposed to sit between it and the bottom of the motherboard because they were too thick. Turns out I didn't need them anyway. After just now 3 days use I am very pleased with the performance of this cooler. I think it is well worth the price, especially if you can get it on sale. One last thought. I cleaned of the Corsair supplied paste from the water block and just used a generic Arctic Thermal 5 paste that was in my supplies that I got from C0mpUSA years ago.

Did not experience the problems others have noted with the radiator being too long for this case, because I mounted the fans against the case frame, with the radiator next. It then cleared the SATA dock of the case with no problem. I have the fans in a straight pull configuration, venting air to the outside of the case after it passes through the radiator. Following Linus on this issue. There is a problem with the screws being too short. The provided screws are #6-32 x 1 1/4"". they need to be 1 1/2"" for a secure installation, especially if using third-party (in my case, Noctua) fans. (The provided screws were even a little too short for the stock Corsair fans.) I had to hung for screws; local hardwares only had zinc or stainless, which I finally bought just to complete the build. I was finally able to find anodized screws the right size on a website that sells hardware for airplanes. Corsair themselves said they didn't have longer screws. So beware of this issue. May be dependent on which case you're using. The screw mounts on the 650D are slightly offset, perhaps deeper than other cases.",None,None

There is a (Oh Darnit!) looseness to the backplate installation that is perfectly normal and disappears as the body bracket is tightened at the finish (found that online after initial panic). Getting a bright red glow from the LED panel requires downloading the extra website HUE+ add-on as the standard color chart doesn't allow the full red setting. Seems that 255/0/0 defaults back to adding in some blue (255/0/56) under the standard color set and makes it Hot Pink. Once done, the product has been flawless. The downloadable CAM program is very neat and useful for fan operation tweaks as well as tracking things. I can't hear the thing run at all until I get the fans up to 65%.

So much so that I have to take the door off my freshly built case and give the fan a flick to get it to shut up for a little while. Note- radiator and fans are mounted horizontally. Docked an egg because of this. Even though the fans aren't the quietest, this would be a five star product if they didn't rattle out of the box. C'mon.INSTALLATION NOTE FOR AMD USERS-I would suggest mounting the radiator and fans BEFORE swapping out the pre-installed Intel pump bracket with the AMD one. (Directions have you do it earlier on). This is because once you take the intel bracket off to replace with the AMD- the plastic packaging 'guard' no longer fits on and you risk bumping the pre-applied thermal paste mating surface against something. I took care not to touch it against anything and was fine- but it's worth pointing out.",3,3
N82E16835181029,35-181-029,11/3/2015 12:36:08 PM,Louis P.,Probably the best CPU cooler for my processor at its current price range,5," Wow, this thing really surprised me. At 1.25 volts, full load OC'd @ 4.2 GHz, my i5 4670k never EVER peaked at 60 degrees Celsius with the stock fan (which was a pretty decent fan in all honesty). I swapped it out with two Noctua NF-F12s for a nice push-pull configuration, and now my temps have trouble reaching 50 degrees Celsius. All you have to do is make them both run at 800 RPM, and you won't hear a thing since they're virtually silent at any given speed. Although the pump casing feels a little hollow and brittle, it's still very sturdy, and a breeze to install as long as you don't overthink the instructions and tighten the backplate in an X pattern. The radiator is very well-built and the piping is flexible, resilient, and easy to work with. I was afraid the plastic backplate would break at some point, but after about half a year of ownership I can say that as long as you trust your gut when installing the pump, relying simply on the instructions, you won't have a problem."," Very mundane cons, none of them deal-breakers. The pump might scare you with a quick spurt of liquid flowing throughout the cooling system when first activated. It only lasts a few seconds so don't be worried. The pump itself makes a small electrical noise, but when enclosed in a panel and surrounded by fans, it becomes inaudible. Finally, the rubber tubes are a bit long, so be mindful about the case you have. My case happens to be a Corsair Obsidian 350D mATX case and I was able to do a push-pull configuration without any issues in the rear fan spot."," Great overall, not a dud and it surpassed my expectations, especially since it replaced my Noctua NH-U12S. The same processor under the same loads and voltages would reach 70 degrees Celsius with the two NF-F12s in push-pull. Also, the H55 has given me less mounting issues than the H110i GT I tested earlier this year.After about 6 months of ownership, its performance hasn't degraded, not even marginally. I love this gem of a cooler.One more thing: it's just me but I don't trust stock thermal paste. I used Noctua's thermal paste, I think it's a nice little upgrade. Just wipe off the stock paste with coffee filters and rubbing alcohol (over 90%), buffer the water block with dry coffer filters (in a circular motion), and apply the new paste on the CPU (I used the pea method, it's never failed me before).",None,None

For coolness I only compared against the stock intel cooler (i-7 950) the boxed intel fan idled at 64 C and reached 86-90 C under load. With the radiator and some arctic silver I now idle at 30-34 C and peak under load 36-38 C. Very consistent low temp. No more burning my CPU.," Not necessarily a con for me, but you will most likely need to pull your Mobo for installation. Also the instructions are extremely vague, the pictures do not represent there live counterparts in great detail and the writers in charge of step-by-step heavily favor brevity."," Keep in mind the added depth of a radiator with a fan attached. The 2 together are about 1.75-2"" in depth, my mid-tower case required some cutting to make it work. The price-point performance of a water-cooled system is the way to go.

It may be cavitation, it may be an obstruction, or maybe a lot of air. I don't know. I do know that many, many, many others have reported this issue. The x61 differs from the x60 in that the x60 pump runs at a fixed rpm (at least, it does in mine: I had an NZXT tech rep tell me it shouldn't and I should rma it. No way.). The fixed rpm may prevent the noise. If I turn the x61 to full speed, the pump noise is greatly reduced.

Only place I could mount was the top slot of the side panel.    Couldn't mount as exhaust on top.  The North Bridge and the ram are in the way.  I think I might have did overkill.  I was able to mount a 140mm intake below the radiator/fan.  I can't mount fans within the case for top exhaust.  I have to mount them on the outside part of the grill.  I place the mesh top panel on top of the fans.  It works.I pulled the plastic guard cover off way early.  It's the part that protects the paste.   I ended up leaving a huge thumbprint right in the center of the paste.  I wonder if that's why the temps flicker by 7C or so.   Lol. Not used to water cooling.

The product itself seems well built but plastic fittings worry me with the tension on it, wish they were metal."," I debated on this and the EKWB Predator with QD, simply because it can bet turned into an open loop, and is cheaper than building a crazy open loop from scratch and dealing with the headache and possible malfunctions (not that this AIO doesn't have those) and ridiculous cost. The lack of reviews for the predator wasn't reassuring and its $80 more. Def happy with my purchase.

When idling, the temp does seem to bounce around a lot, but the liquid temp usually sits at 31-33*C.- Very quiet- Noticeably louder in Performance Mode (or if you manually crank up the fans and pump speeds), but it doesn't sound like a vacuum cleaner. I guess it can be described as ""realistically loud""?- With the exception of the S340 case, this should be a relatively simple installation. Please see my notes below about using this in a S340"," - The included fan mounting screws could be just a bit longer. I think they're something like 28mm, and the fans are 25mm (a little thicker due to the rubber mounting pads), leaving only a couple threads exposed for mounting. Conventionally, this isn't an issue, unless you're running a push configuration inside an NZXT S340 case. The screws not only have to pass through the fans into the radiator, but in this particular setup, the screws also need to pass through the front baffling of the case, as well.- The hoses are certainly long enough to use this setup in just about any case configuration, but I feel like maybe they could be just a bit shorter? I could be wrong though, and it doesn't affect the functionality of the X61. It looks a bit lame having the hoses hanging all over my GPU, but I'm not docking an egg for this."," I'm not docking an egg for the screw issue, because I was still able to mount the X61 in my case securely with no problems, but it was a bit of a hassle. I'm definitely docking an egg off the case for a poorly designed front section, though. Without having removed the wire separator first, there's no way to run a push/pull config, and even with a push-only, there's hardly ANY room at all, even for a low-profile setup like the X61.

I really liked the idea of a closed loop water cooler for my CPU so I did some research and a lot of people experienced the same thing, but said that Corsair fixed this with their newer designs. I decided to give them another shot so I bought an H80i here refurbished to mitigate the loss I experienced from the last cooler disaster. It worked very well at first and even better than the H60 with no leaks and cool temps. It lasted a little over 18 months until the pump failed. I figured it should be under warranty still right? I started the RMA process and got declined because while the warranty is five years, it's only a year on refurbished items. I know this is something I should have known before purchase, but it doesn't make my experience any better. I am out almost $700 because of these products and will never buy a Corsair product again.

Looks kinda cool, especially with the colored LED."," The performance seems like it has degraded over the almost two years I've had this. I don't know if that is normal, but I'm thinking of replacing it with an air cooler from Noctua since the H80i has become really noisy, even with several different fans. They need to run almost full speed to keep my system at 55C while doing something simple like watching streaming video. If I slow the fan down, it spikes up to near 100.I re applied thermal paste and all of that. Everything looks like it is seated correctly and it just won't cool as well as it used to.

I had to buy some nylon and fiber washers to add to the back plate in order to completely seat the heatsink to the CPU. This was a major problem at first (because you can't really tell it's not touching the CPU when you've got it fully tightened). I started my PC up and my CPU temp was at 50* idle and climed to 100* (ouch) almost instantly in Prime 95. Pulled the cooler off and noticed none of the Corsair thermal paste had touched the CPU cap. The back plate fit loosely on the motherboard, with about a 1/4"" gap if you pull the backplate as far as it can go. This gap (and looseness) meant that when you tighten the CPU heatsink on the studs, the front plate/heatsink is actually pulling the backplate firmly against the /back/ of the motherboard. That is not what you want to happen. The back plate needs to be tight with no gap in order to make sure that the back plate is pulling the CPU heatsink firmly against the /front/ of the motherboard, and thereby the CPU itself. Once I found out this was the problem, the fix was a trip to home depot to get a couple of packs of nylon and fiber washers (do not use metal washers!) ."," - Corsair needs to provide additional mounting hardware. The included back plate washers are not sufficient in some cases.  Also, the instructions are terrible.- If you notice that the backplate is wiggling after you've attached it, DO NOT ATTACH THE HEATSINK. You must add washers to the backplate until it is firmly held tight against the back of the motherboard.- DO NOT plug the water pump (heatsink 3 pin connector) to a CPU fan slot on the motherboard if you are using variable fan controls. The pump must be running at 100% at all times, which is about 4000 RPM according to my motherboard BIOS. Plug the pump into a SYSFAN slot in order to make sure it works at full capacity.",4,5

Just had to set all the adjustable bolts in the included backplate to the closest to the center.-Not having to buy instead an ugly, bulky, heavy, and over-sized air fan, which might be so big it might not fit your case. After I chose my CPU (Intel Core i7 6700k) I read it didn't come with an included cooling solution. So I started looking for recommendations on what were my alternatives. A lot of people were recommending gigantic monster fans and heatsinks which I wanted to avoid due to their bulkiness and fear that it would put too much stress/weight on my CPU and motherboard's retention mechanism over time. After some research it seemed that there was no way around it by using air cooling without having to compromise cooling performance so I started looking for liquid cooling. I was looking for something that would be easy to install, secure as to avoid leaks and equipment damage, quiet, effective, and small above all. When i learned this product was self-contained as in not having to be primed nor filled manually with the liquid and how compact it was I was pretty much sold.-Very silent, I can't even notice it's there, and I have very good hearing. My case fans produce the only noticeable sound.-great price for a liquid cooling solution.-You don't need access to a printer to claim the rebate!"," -The only con I can think of was having to store some mechanical energy in the elastic hoses by having to bend them as would be the norm to install them inside the computer case. It feels like it's placing a bit too much elastic energy/stress on the motherboard, perhaps this might be solved in a future model by including more flexible hoses (without compromising quality and resistance to leakage of course). In spite of this I still would recommend this product.-Not really a con of the product itself, but I felt that the instructions weren't very clear as to which connector on the motherboard I should connect the pump and radiator fan to. I ended up just guessing and connected the radiator fan to the CPU1 fan connector/sensor, and the pump was connected to the CPU2 fan connector on my motherboard. I'm still unsure if I should have connected them the other way around, nor if it makes any difference at all."," I tried a cheap air-fan first just for comparison, CPU ran at about 55C idle, and under load it would easily sit at 83C; then I installed CORSAIR Hydro Series H60 and i was so surprised that my computer at idle was pretty much running just above room temperature at about 24C, and under load at about 45C. Needless to say I was very satisfied by these results.  This was my first liquid-cooling build after having used air cooling for about 20 years, and it has been definitely a great experience so far.

Until it's fully installed the attached hoses caused the radiator to fall on to my motherboard/processor and a second pair of hands would help., While playing World of Tanks at max settings on high resolution I noticed the white NZXT logo on my Kraken start flicking from white to red more and more until solidly red. I believe this is an overheat warning. I left the game and it went white again. Because I was viewing the installation animation on another computer I did not follow the last step which was to download the CAM software which controls fan/pump settings. I noticed it defaults to SILENT and I changed this to PERFORMANCE and have not had a problem since. CPU temp of my 4970K stays around 40C with CAM defaulting an alarm at 80 degrees which is good but it also monitors the liquid temp which is averages 30-40 degrees when playing games and the alarm default is only 10 degrees higher.

I went with a push configuration, with it top mounted and acting as an exhaust. Temps are pretty much the same that I was getting on air, with between 30-35C at idle and around 55C on load (not overclocked). I kept the stock thermal paste and installed it according to the instructions.The ability to change the LED is very cool; thankfully there are makers out there who understand people have different themes going on. So kudos to NZXT on that one! Green is such a hard LED to find these days."," Included instructions are a little vague and lacking in depth. As a water cooling noob it would have been nice to get some more detail on how to actually put this thing together. But I got an instructional video online so no biggie.When it comes to noise, I honestly couldn't tell you what's normal for water cooling, but I can relate what I've noticed so far. Upon boot, a small 'gurlging' or 'clicking' can be heard for a few seconds but instantly goes away; I attribute this to the pump simply powering up. Other than that, I can't even hear the thing unless I take off the panel and put my ear right next to it. Even during gaming, the pump is barely heard. The fans are also very silent, only kicking in if temps breach 50C (which I told them to do in my custom fan profile).The CAM software is...well...not that great. On the plus side it gives me good temp readings for both the CPU and the liquid inside the pump, so that's nice. But on the downside, when CAM is running my pump 'clicks' every few seconds. Very noticeable and obvious. The second I exit the software, the clicking stops. After some Googling, this is apparently a common problem with the Kraken. Not enough to make me want to return it, but it solved my clicking problem instantly. Everything can't be perfect I guess."," This is the very first time I've dealt with water cooling, so I kept it simple and stuck with an AIO so the hassle would be minimal. I bought this directly from NZXT along with a case since this was my first time, so I figured straight from the manufacturer was the way to go. It fit perfectly and I honestly couldn't be happier. The CAM software glitch prevents this from getting 5 eggs, but really I'm sure a patch could fix that.This is a first impression review; obviously, time will be the ultimate factor.

This just makes more sense then letting the hot internal air cool your radiator.I also added 2 top mounted 140mm pull fans for added cooling.This is a huge 140mm radiator so make sure your case will support it.All I needed to do was remove the top large case cooling fan and use the rear 140mm as my air out fan!For the guy with a 4 star tech rating. YES this will fit socket 1155 CPUs you just need to bend the under plate, that's plastic and get aligned correctly.How can you rate yourself with a 4 star tech knowledge when you can't figure out that all you need to do is bend the plastic under mount for the socket 1155-1156-0r 1050 sockets to fit properly?The worst case issue is that you received a miss-molded back plate that Corsair will ship to you for free!Fantastic cooler and the larger the radiator the easier the faster the liquid will cool. This by far the best full radiator design I have ever used or even tested!Good to see Corsair has got back on there game.The coolers to avoid now are the Cool Master models or any model with the pump located on the fan assembly.This simply gives you 4 more potential leak points and is a horrible design!",3,5

No biggie.Big one here: My first cooler was defective, came with a very strange gurgle in the pump that wouldn't go away, as if there was air in the loop. I sent it for a replacement, and had it within a week. Not bad at all, I'm very satisfied, so I'll leave the 5 eggs without smashing. I know things aren't perfect, and for that reason a manufacturer has their warranty. When they don't own up to their warranty conditions though, then yeah, I'll smash away the eggs."," Ended up throwing it in front, added 4 Phanteks 140mm PWM fans to run in push/pull, and threw in 2x140mm Fanteks (ha, see what I did there) blue LED fans I had laying around in the front, replacing the stock AF140L fans. Cool air is being fed to the cooler, and then it is pushed out to my Sapphire R9 380, which is also fed by a 120mm fan near the PSU. Great temps all round, which is also due to great cooling solutions.",2,2

I bought with it the Kraken G10 bracket and they work really well together. The card that i'm using is a Sapphire 7870 and usually my idle temps are around 30 C and full load around 60-70 C depending on the game. The reason i bought this was because one of the fans on my stock heatsink went bad and I decided to go this route because it was cheaper than buying a new card and I already have the H60 for my CPU. Right now my idle temp is around 18 C and when I was playing Battlefield 4 on ultra it peaked at 36 C. I'm using HWmonitor to check the temps., None,,3,3
N82E16835146042,35-146-042,10/17/2015 11:00:29 AM,Quinten M.,Love it,5," The Kraken x61 is the best AIO water cooler I have purchased.  It has a built in fan hub for up to 4 fans to plug in the radiator fans into.  It looks great.  The 400mm Tube length makes it very easy to install wherever you would like in your case.  The cam software is really great actually, I have heard some bad things about it so I was a little worried at first.  It seems they have addressed many people complaints and made the software very nice and intuitive.  In silent mode I literally cannot hear a thing! and the idle temps are in the range of 26 - 30 degrees C.  Pretty normal temps for idle IMO, and for being 100% Silent, I am extremely impressed. Performance mode keeps the temps low under load and still remains relatively quiet.  I was comparing this to the Corsair h110i gtx and am very happy I chose this one.  Absolutely recommended."," non really so far, at first there was a little clicking noise coming from the pump in silent mode.  I was thinking it may have been an air bubble that just needed to be worked out over time. I then found some posts online from others having the same issue and they had said they changed the pmw setting of their CPU fan in the BIOS to 100% at all times, and that resolved the issue, sure enough it did.  Make sure you do this so CAM and the Kraken can regulate the Speeds and Voltages rather than your BIOS and you should not hear any clicking noise.", Highly Recommended,2,2

It was a bit of a challenge to bend it into place without the whole case sliding. So I had to get on the carpet and use my knees to hold the case so I could get the pump onto the CPU. In the process the copper plate on the pump assembly was rubbing onto the CPU and smeared part of the pre-applied thermal paste on the CPU. However it dose not appear to have messed up anything. I would suggest if you are putting this into a mid tower that you have someone hold the case while you attempt to bend the hosing and set the pump onto the CPU.  Not really worth knocking an egg off for though., Keeps my AMD FX-8350 Black Edition running at around 16C idle and under 40C while running prime 95 for over an hour under stock voltage and using the pre-applied thermal paste.

This was possible, but it was a real pain as it doesn't really fit.First year and few months the system was quiet and ran more than cool enough for stock system, even when running games."," I mostly got the system to be quiet and possibly for over clocking later. For the first year and 3 or 4 months, the system was quite and it ran cool enough. However, in the last month or so one of the 140 MM fans bearings have started failing making it get louder until I had to unplug the fan. Sadly this is right around the time I wanted to start over-clocking as I got a new  GTX 980 and want to ensure the CPU isn't holding the video card back. Not a fault of the Cooler but getting it in and out of my C70 case is quite a pain, so even if I get replacement fan I will get to spend a few hours fighting   to get the cooler in and out of my case.For the cost I expected the fans to last at least 3 years of heavy use instead of the 1 year and 4 months of light to moderate use I got out of it.

So know which direction you need the airflow to go through the radiator before installing as it does not include screws that will allow you to set up the radiator on the case with the fan behind it.

The products I have, forced me to remove the cooling fins from my GSkill memory.  However, this is a minor inconvenience.  Because I have two of the same motherboards, processors, memory, etc.  I tested one of these coolers to see what types of issues I would see.  In general, no major issues except for me not taking into account the dimensions of my memory sticks.

I even bought the Corsair sp 120 still wouldn't do it. but thats most likely just my stupidity., Not enough to take off an egg and now that i typed this entire thing it makes no sense because a lot of people use those fans for exhaust..... im to lazy to delete just pay no mind and ill check into it again.

Nice glowy blue disk looks good on my motherboard."," I had a few problems with the installation, which looks like it should have been easier than it turned out to be. My case is an NZXT 210 - admittedly one of their cheaper models - but it does have the 240mm mounting space at the top. The radiator just barely won't fit. Lacks about 1/2"" clearance. Now, this ""one size fits most"" issue has been true of PCs since the old DOS days, and nothing says anywhere that the unit WILL fit my case, but still. Frustrating (it seems Steve Jobs was right, after all). Also, the retention ring has to actually clip onto the mounting bracket itself as part of the initial assembly. It took a few minutes for me to figure this out as the instructions were unclear. Currently, the unit is running, but the radiator is balanced on the case with the side panel removed, until I can order a new case."," I didn't take an egg off simply because the unit wouldn't fit my case - I accept the blame for insufficient research on that point. But some of the hardware parts seem cheaply made, and I had a hard time seating the pump unit onto my motherboard because of that.

CPU temps are pretty good."," Sadly I was disappointed and blame myself more than anything.  1) The Corsair Logo on the pump does NOT light up.  It is simply silkscreens on the plastic covering.  Don't load Corsair Link, it wont recognize it.  I expected that the Extreme Performance would have these rather simple bells and whistles but nope - the lower-end units do.  Don't understand that one Corsair.  The fans to the radiator were a pain to mount but if you position the fans and thread  2 of the screws per fan, then use some scotch tape to keep them in position it's a piece of cake.  Complaint two is the pump bracket is an utter nightmare to try to put together after you've cleaned off the copper surface.  I mean it's a freaking stupid design that could be so much simpler.  I bet I spent an hour trying to get it all 'snapped' together to get it on the CPU and locked down."," If you are in the market for one of these closed loops.

I drilled out the mounting hole on each side, then carefully inserted a rats-tail file to clear out the thin fins (someone had warned me of the possibility of twisting them around a drill bit, causing them to tear off, and thereby damaging the coolant-filled fin where they join).

The fan included also lives up to the expectations. The hose is sturdy, yet flexible enough to allow easy installation, even in small cases."," It is just a bit less noisier than my stock cooler. Before you buy this or some other water cooler, consider if you really need one, as a conventional (but quality) fan and heat sink can get the job done just as well, for less noise. For the casual computer user, for example, it is a bit too much. Another thing to note is that the fan included doesn't have an arrow to indicate air flow, while it is stated so in the quick installation manual. Furthermore, the quick installation manual instructs you to put the fan on the outside, while at the product's official webpage it is shown on the inside. Make sure you do some research about this, as well as whether the fan should be set as intake or exhaust. Additionally, note that the screws you will use to mount the fan and radiator to the case are round, not flat head. If you have a small case, make sure there are gaps to allow insertion or that the screws will not collide with the side panel, or the side panel won't close all the way."," I would recommend this liquid cooler, especially to those who overclock.

They do the job, but are noisy."," This was a replacement for an H100 that had a noisy pump. I personally prefer the quality Asetek OEMs (H105) to the Coolit-made models (H100i, H100.)Had 4 Cougar PWMs in push-pull on the H100, but decided to try this one with the 2 stock fans, as they are the same as the well regarded SPs (without the rubber corners or trim ring.) They keep it cool enough - at least as cool as the H100 with the 4 Cougars - but they are noisy anywhere above about 60%. I'm going to try a pair of 1850 GT PWMs in push-only to see how they do for temperature and quiet operation.To the reviewer below who listed the splitter as a con because it has only one 4-pin connector (the other is 3-pin) and wondered why, it's because it has to be that way. The MOBO can read only one speed signal at any one fan header. (I didn't use the supplied splitter, but used one I had in the case already, but it, too, of course only has 4-pin to one fan... as the the 4-way splitter to the 4 fans in my side intake. Only one of the 4 fans has a 4-pin connection.)Update: with a pair of GT PWMs, this cooler is everything it should be. Instead of the roar when the stock fans spun up (on CPU load) the GTs remain quiet. I have to listen for them to hear a difference.The temps were actually a couple of degrees lower when I first installed the GTs, although that may also be due to blowing out the case filters and cooler fins during the fan swap.

Most difficult part was deciding how to integrate it with my EVGA 980Ti hybrid which is liquid cooled as well. Fortunately, the Corsair 900D has so much room (480mm), I could install the video card radiator which takes one 120mm, skip one bay and install the H105 in the remaining bays."," if you are attempting to make a neat build, the glossy cheap looking 3 pin pump wire is difficult to hide or clean up. I would suggest as a future revision, have a 3 pin wire plug at the pump. Provide a 3 pin cable for those would do not care what it looks like but give me the option to install an individually sleeved 3 pin cable to make it look nice. I have to leave it.

This thing could not possibly be compatible with the lga 1150 asus maximus vii formula mobo. Installing the backplate was a nightmare as well. To top all of this the radiator came with a dent in it and one of the back plate screws were missing -.-. As if this werent bad enough you have to spin these micro screws in the back plate with your fingers to line them up with the plate. THIS IS PAINFUL TO MY POOR FINGER TIPS.

If you mount the unit to the cpu first and you are not extremely careful, it will cause the cpu to twist in the socket.  On an intel mobo, this causes some of the springy contact pins to move ever so slightly out of place so the contact is either lost or 'touchy' between the cpu and mobo.  In my situation, it caused the memory controller portion to not function properly.  THAT took a while to figure out.  Could not repair mobo so had to buy another one."," The stiff hoses is the only reason for 4 star rating.  Could be lack of fore-thought on my part.

Keeps the cores in my Core i7 3770K (stock speed) between 27-31C at idle and 57-58C at full load (measured after running the Prime95 Stress Test for 5 minutes so the temps could stabilize).," No dust filter. In the recommended configuration, with the fan blowing into the case, dust tends to accumulate on the surface of the radiator, between the fan and the radiator. It's a bit of a nuisance when I have to completely remove the fan and radiator to vacuum the dust off of the radiator."," Added a 120mm 1,500 rpm green LED fan to the other side of the radiator (mostly to help light up the inside of my ATX case) and was pleasantly surprised to find that the push-pull effect dropped my max temps 3 degrees to 54-55C. Also surprising was that there was no change to the idle temps. So I guess, at idle, the cooler was already working at max efficiency without the extra fan.This cooler seems to be designed very well for what it does. Since the extra fan made no difference at idle and only made a 3 degree difference at full load, I would not consider adding a second fan mandatory for most people. But, if your case has a see-thru side panel and you add an LED fan as I did, it can make your build look a lot cooler (pun intended).  It's nice to have that option.In case you're interested, the H60 doesn't come with extra #6-32 x 1-1/4"" screws to mount a 2nd fan.

(my first time trying liquid cooling)Keeps my CPU running ice cold even over clocked.Looks cool.," Wow the fans that come with this are loud. When I first booted up my PC after putting everything together I thought something was wrong. Sounds like a plane taking off. The cooler is definitely worth the buy, but when you buy it just go ahead and buy new fans at the same time and save yourself the hassle of installing then swapping them, because you're going to need to."," At the request of another reviewer, I bought two of these:http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835553002COUGAR CF-V12HP Vortex Hydro-Dynamic-Bearing (Fluid) 300,000 Hours 12CM Silent Cooling Fan with Pulse Width ModulationTo replace the super loud fans.

I had to file and cut/ mod the case just a bit to fit this inside of my case. Now the 820 says it can handle a 280 mm radiator but if the H110 is truly a 280 mm radiator I would have assumed it would have fit just fine. However every time I tried to adjust it so that I can use my fans side of the radiator would be missing the final fan mounts, hidden behind the top of the case right after the radiator mounting holes. It was frustrating to say because I couldn't understand why this had happened and just chalked it up to bad luck. Instead of returning the H110 though I just decided it would be better to cut/file into the case and extend the radiator mounting holes which worked perfectly.

The install is pretty simple. The manual is basic but this is a bolt and wire up process. Just relax and take your time...., I think this is like this for all products....

Pay attention to which set you use for mounting purposes. When mounting the radiator, I had issues keeping it balanced. I suggest you mount the external screws loosely, until all 8 can be installed.

9SIA6ZP3K32295,35-181-035,8/20/2014 4:29:38 PM,Patrick H.,So big and so little satisfaction,1, It arrived intact and it didn't leak.," I’m very disappointed in this cooler from the complex installation process to the only marginal cooling result.  Let’s start with the installation which is frustrating and overly Rube Goldberg complex.  I installed this on an ASUS Z87-Pro motherboard with a core i5 4760K processor.  I have had several other CPU coolers on this package including a refurbished Corsair H100 with a defective processor that required me to plug the (2) fans into the motherboard and a Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo that was a superb performer.  I have been building computers for fifteen years and an definitely not a newbie and I actually like a challenger.  The problem is when I’m presented a challenge like installing the H110 and the results are subpar.To begin the installation you are required to insert 4 small metal nuts into the plastic backplate for Socket 1150.  The manual shows you where one goes but the other 3 don’t go in the same locations on the other tabs.  I had to get a magnifying glass to figure this one out because the proper locations are marked in raised letters almost impossible to see if not outside in direct sunlight.The Intel mounting plate requires 4 offset inserts and 4 lower inserts that go into the upper inserts and the manual is not too explicit about how the lower inserts install.  I don’t mean it’s impossible to figure out but I’ve installed plenty of these all in one liquid coolers and this was by far the most involved.  I know they want to make it universal but why so many parts?  I installed this in a Corsair 730 full tower which I have to assume was built to house this cooler.  It does fit but it’s a nightmare to line up the fans and the radiator and get the screws in.  And I mean that it is a six hands needed disaster.   Finally when I got the whole thing done I find that two of the fancy screws that mount the cooler to the backplate won’t tighten down fully even though I didn’t use a screwdriver, only my fingers on the plastic outer rings.  I’m not sure if they’re stripped or what but I don’t want to tighten them more for fear of stripping the whole thing and rendering the cooler useless.  The cooling is only mediocre, certainly not as good as the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo fan I replaced.  I had a Corsair H100 that was on its last legs that kept this same mother board and CPU at a constant 32 degrees.  The best this one can do at full tilt is 34.  And this is with (2) 140 mm intake fans and (1) 140mm exhaust fan."," I was ready to give up and take it off and send it back for a refund but it was so much trouble to install it that I’m just going to leave it on.  It does keep the CPU below 50 at all times and it idles around 34.  Going to have to carefully check the 2 screws that don’t seem to want to tighten.  Right now it seems the cooler is tight enough.  I just won’t try any overclocking.  Really, avoid this at all costs even at the attractive promo code price.",2,7
9SIA85V4NG1052,35-181-031,3/5/2015 11:46:41 AM,Conner L.,Some problems but GREAT product,4," I love this cooler, better than stock for its price. Idles my 8350 at 30cI had some problems with this though I will explain. I am a huge fan of corsair, I have 2 corsair psus and a corsair case and this H80i. They are a great reliable company."," The problems I encountered with this is nothing much of the cooler, its fine. The Manual was kinda confusing. Includes 4 washers with the screws but shows using 8 and dont explain where or which screws to use the washers. Stiff tubing but managed to get the darn thing onto my AMD chip. The cooler and fan on the radiator needs to be plugged into a fan header. Here's the major problem I had. The manual doesnt specify which fan header to plug the block header into. The block thats rests on the CPU. so I figured that the block should be plugged into the CPU fan header on the mobo. This caused sooo much headache till just recently. My mobo kept giving me Errors and wouldnt let me boot. I figured out finally after months of trying to figure this out that the Mobo registered the Block as 0 RPM and wouldnt boot because it thought things would overheat. I spent hours talking to Asus customer service and Tomshardware people and everyone thought it was the PSU or Mobo or Cpu bent pins. I put the fan on the radiator into the CPU header and the block 4pin header onto a normal plug on the Mobo and it boots. I realize this is probably a Mobo thing but no one could figure this out and wasnt in the Corsair H80i as to where to plug that in which in this case, does matter on my mobo."," That problem caused me so much stress but got it figured out and really there isnt anything wrong with the cooler, It preforms great and glad I got it.",2,2

9SIA85V4NG1052,35-181-031,3/4/2015 2:43:20 AM,David M.,"Stylish Cooler, Superb Customer Service",5," It's kept my 3770K and 4770K cool for over two years. The H80i is no longer the champ (I believe it belongs to the H110 now), but it still is a worthy contended to any liquid CPU cooler. So what makes this CPU better than the rest? The name and reputation of Corsair.Bottom line -- I've had this cooler for over two years now; and while I've had an issue or two, customer service has always had my back. So while another company might promise to shave off a few more degrees, it just doesn't quite compare with a company that stands by their products.Not the ideal test, but to give you an idea as to how it performs -- I ran a basic sensor test on RealTemp (using Prime95 as the actual stress test) using a single fan on the ""quiet"" setting on a 4770K running at 4.4 with 1.185v on the core and the first three cores topped out at 74c --  64c for the last core. With two fans, I can easily see it topping off at about 68c -- and again, this is on the quite setting. 70c is average when running BOINC with 8 threads. With the H80i, I can push to 1.25v+, but I wouldn't be able to live with the noise and heat in my room. At 4.2 running at 1.1v, I'm usually in the 58-62c range with BOINC on all eight threads -- and again, using the quite setting."," !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Careful when screwing in the fans to the unit -- it's incredible easy to strip the threads (that or I just have bear hands).  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It's not silent. I haven't compared the noise to it's main competitor, Noctua, but on the ""quite"" setting, it's relatively quite. Not too much to cry about, but do note that on ""balanced mode,"" it has a presence in a quite room; on ""performance,"" it sounds more like a server. These settings are presets that vary the RPM of the fans according to CPU usage -- promising low noise even on high overclocks, unless it's in use; once you're playig BF4 at 5.2Ghz, you probably wont hear the fans with everything else going on.Corsair Link could be a little better. It has been getting better over time and it's nice knowing they're perfecting it.I had a unit RMA'd and received a new unit. On this new unit, the light on the glowing Corsair emblem tends to change from I input in Corsair Link (the color shifts, yellow to white-yellow; red to hot-pink) -- but it doesn't bother me enough to do another RMA."," Not a full review, but just wanted to rate this cooler. I've been quite pleased with the warranty and customer support and that's why I'm giving it 5 stars.",1,1

That being said I have yet to try re-seat the pump to see if the temps would change, only reason is because I don't mind the temps. Im using an asus m5a99fx pro 2.0 motherboard with a amd FX-8120 Zambezi 8-Core 3.1 GHz cpu. My temps are around 30-35°C idle and under about 5 mins of stress testing the temps evened out at around 51-57°C. While playing games like cs:go or diablo 3 temps are around 40-45°C. So overall I am happy as far as temps go. Now as far as installation goes, I recently purchased a thor v2 case and planned to mount the rad with a push pull fan setup on the top of the case. When the case arrived I soon found out that my ram does not provide enough clearance for a push pull setup the way the case had it designed for. So I was able to actually mount it in push pull by mounting it at an angle but was unable to screw all but one screw in. That soon lead to a unbearable rattling sound, so I decided to just go with a push setup with the two fans being mount on the top of the case and the rad inside."," The fans that come with this are extremely loud, I would suggest buying others.

The Intel back plate contains 4 spacers that install into your motherboard that you then attach the 4 standoff screws into.  The problem is the back plate was designed for motherboards made with a thicker circuit board material.  Motherboards such as the ASUS Maximus VII Hero are thinner so the 4 spacers on the back plate end up protruding beyond the circuit board on the opposite side where you attach the standoff screws.  The standoff screws will then bottom out on the back plate leaving the assembly loose and resulting in the 4 standoffs being slightly higher off of the motherboard equal to the reduced thickness of the circuit board.  This will result in the pump not getting enough pressure against your CPU leading to poor thermal transfer and your CPU overheating.The second issue is the Fan power Y cable has the wrong connectors on it and will not plug into the fans.  The fans have the standard motherboard connectors on them and will not connect to the cable they provided.This is my third issue with Corsair in the last 9 months with the first two being related to their K95 keyboards.  The quality is really going downhill fast and the customer service is right behind.," When you see this response from them don't get your hopes up - They don't work with you and they don't improve your experience.Manufacturer Response:Dear customer,We're sorry to hear that your replacement also had LED issues.

It can handle up to 4GHz, which is the stock speed of the CPU, and hits temps anywhere between 60 to 70c while I play games with the turbo turned off.  It gets the job done for cooling, average idle is around 35c and doesn't make too much noise in comparison to what I heard others say."," I was impressed when I got it in the mail as the packaging was excellent, however, upon opening the box I frowned.  The instructions were a bit on the vague side for most first time installers of a water cooling system.  After some comparison and a trial run later I got it up and running.  What really killed me while installing the system was that the back plate was actually loose!  I've never had a bad back plate prior to ordering this kit, in addition to that the radiator itself was damaged and had what looked like handling damage from the factory.  Combine that with the heat issues I have with my CPU peaking at 70c I would recommend staying away from this if you need serious cooling power.",,1,5

So I got this around Christmas for 50$, which I thought was a steal since it was 30$ off, a terrible decision on my part.I have a 4770k not overclocked and a ThorV2 case and this thing was such a pain. My stock CPU cooler temperatures were at 29 idle and around 60-70 at 60% load and 97 at 100% load. The H80i is 32-34C at idle 40-50C at 10% load, 60C at around 50% load and 80-82C at 100% load. Honestly not worth the price at all I should've just went with an Evo or something else as this thing was beyond a pain to install. My first time hooking it up it took about an hour mainly because it wouldn't clamp to the CPU snug (1150 mobo). So first time running it i have a 40C idle temp and 89C 100% load, I was beyond upset mainly because I spent 50$ on this thing and I'm getting almost the same temperature as the stock intel cpu cooler. So I move the rad from the exhaust fan and move it to the top of my case using a push method which got me at 38C idle and 89C at 100% only like a 2C difference.The corsair Link software was not working at all. The fan, pump and led would not change at all, so I had to spend a couple hours online trying to find a fix for it on windows 8.1 Also it would constantly crash my PC which I have yet to find a fix for.After a while of being annoyed of fan noise and tempatures I went out and bought some thermal paste and applied it using the pea method and finally some good temperatures. I was getting 27C idle and 80C at 100% load. Playing BF4 on Max at 1080P gives me around 50C.Now 2 weeks later im getting 31-35C idle temps, corsair link resets everytime I boot it up and constantly crashes my computer so I just end the application and even use it all. The fans have to be load for me just to get 30C and the LED resets everey time I turn on my PC.Honestly just stay away from this product, a stock cooler nets you almost the same results and ITS FREE.

For $65 dollars on sale, this seemed to be better performance than I would get out of a CPU fan, and I didn't like how bulky the fans were- very top heavy looking like they'd warp the motherboard after a few years of use. (after removing the giant fan from the old mobo before throwing it in the trash I can confirm it was indeed bowed where the fan used to hang.For the price, I'm very happy. I can overclock if I ever learn how, and I don't have fins to fill up with dust.The install was easy, it took me about an hour working at a very leisurely pace (I try to work slowly so I don't screw anything up) and it worked right away with no trouble at all.Other than the first few seconds after booting, the fan is remarkably quiet. I was hesitant to buy this after seeing a couple reviews complain of noise, but it honestly blew me away how little sound comes out of it. Off the top of my head, I believe it is reported to run at 34 decibels, which is between a desert at midnight and a whisper, according to whatever link showed up first on google. Including the cooler my case has 3 120mm fans and 3 240mm fans, and it makes only a barely audible white noise.One recommendation I would make is to install the 1st fan and the radiator, but wait on the last fan; install the water block and plug in the USB controller, because that plug is going right under the 2nd fan and its a pain in the neck to plug it in otherwise.

Thus no drop in egg for that... or the fact that when installing by myself (without roommate assistance or perhaps proper pre-planning?)

The manual states to tighten the standoffs ""firmly secure"" which I did, and promptly stripped one of the holes in the backplate.

Some creative repairs using the AMD standoffs with courser threads (6-32), solved my issue.

Even using an aftermarket air cooler, this reduced my idle temps by about 4 degrees celsius, and my load temps by about 9 degrees celsius.Everything about this cooler feels quite sturdy.NO PUSH PINS!!!  I personally dislike Intel’s push pin cooler attachment design.  I think I’ve only been able to get all 4 push pins to engage as intended once ever.  If I need to remove the motherboard from the case to ensure that the heatsink is properly engaged, I vehemently prefer having screws with a backplate."," Size - Most cases use 120mm fans as their standard intake/exhaust size.  The 280mm size almost necessitates having the cooler mounted externally (if you even can).The fans are a touch too noisy for my taste; if you have a water cooling block this large, then you don’t need a fan which generates any noticeable noise.While it does come with some thermal paste already applied, I view this as as a con.  Many enthusiasts who invest in aftermarket cooling like this will be using aftermarket thermal interface material, as well; removing it is just an additional hassle."," This was tested using a full ATX tower with front and side intake fans, two rear and one top exhaust fans.

9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,3/23/2016 4:28:29 PM,Jill A.,Nice CPU Liquid Cooler,5," Cooler was easy to install out of the box, the instructions where easy for me to follow. The software was not finicky to get working.  The unit is not very loud, the sound levels it produces do not bother me one bit.  It outperforms the stock CPU coolers by leaps and bounds. It also outperformed my after marker copper heat pipe cooler as well. ( See recorded temps in other section ) It's nice that the tubing seems to have a bit of a built in swivel on the pump side, giving you a little bit of flexibility to install the radiator to fit your case.  (I installed my cooler in my Corsair Air A540 Cube and it fit easily) The build quality as a whole feels durable and sturdy. The radiator mounts give you options to adjust and setup mounting and fan positions with ease."," I feel that the power cable going to the unit should be a bit beefier and that there might be a better way to connect everything up to the unit, there is a small handful of cables that come out of the pump that sits on the water block to connect to everything.  The fans do make a bit of noise, but I was not bothered by them one bit.  While the unit did perform well, I think it could do better cooling wise, but it's performance and stability did not disappoint.  The software seems to have a glitch that will hopefully be fixed in a later update, it would, after a while, start to take up 100% usage of 1 of my cpu cores, not sure why, but Googling this confirmed I am not the only one who has had this issue.  The software could use some more options for the light on the cooler, but that does not affect how it functions as a cooler. The software could use to be a bit more intuitive."," I did multiple tests of the unit against 2 other coolers. A stock Intel Cooler and an After Market Copper Heat Pipe Cooler.  The hardware this cooler was used in / on was is as follows: Corsair Air A540 Case, Asus Motherboard, Intel Core i7 4790K, 16gb Corsair DDR3 Memory, 1000 Watt Antec PSU.  As for my testing, 4 things to note before I show my results. First the ambient room temperature was between 19C (67F) ~ 21C (70F). Second, testing with the stock Intel cooler caused my CPU to start thermal throttling and slowing down as far as 3.79 Ghz from 4.2 Ghz Idle, which both the Corsair H115i and the aftermarket cooler I had did cause thermal throttling occur. Third, tests ran for 45 minutes each to allow temperatures to stabilize, running Prime 95 to stress the CPU, temps were read from the Asus motherboard software that came with my motherboard.  Fourth,  I had the fans on my radiator in a pull configuration, exhausting out of the top of my case.

It does take up quite a bit of room and the hoses come down (if properly installed) in the top left of my motherboard where I have a few plugins that interfere so I had to slide it back further into the case then I would have wanted.  Some people mentioned that it was almost silent, I am more inclined to think these people suffer from hearing loss.  I wouldn't call it silent but instead, the noise level for me basically remained the same since I removed two fans that I had in the case but replaced them with the two from the cooler.  There were a few vague areas in the installation but easy enough to figure out.  They really individually packet and label the different studs they provide depending on what socket of motherboard.  You have to figure these out on your own and the same thing with the plugins for the cpu block.  Most of these are easy to know and plug in but I had one 4pin connector that I hope was an optional for an old style of power supply because I didn't have anything to match it with my modular Corsair power supply.",1,1
9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,3/22/2016 12:31:21 AM,Dariusz T.,Yet Another Great Product by Corsair,5," The entire product appears to be well built and doesn't look as though Corsair cut any obvious corners with this product. The hoses are very thick and the seals look like they aren't going to be coming off any time soon. The radiator, as expected is a thin 280mm  one and fit nicely into the front of my NXTZ S340 case. The fans are slightly larger than a typical 120mm fan and move alot more air which I love. They are not super silent but acceptable. More air movement = better cooling. Speaking of the fan, there are no lights. Which is fine with me. The pump housing has some RBG lights and can be configured to either blue, red or white which is awesome.Some other Pro's that I like about this item are:-CPU runs cooler-Internal temps are lower- More case air-flow-Relatively straight forward installation-Inexpensive for a water cooled solution-5 year manufacturer warranty (great peace of mind)", Well it is a very nice unit and does do what it was designed to do and that is to fit in newer gen cases and provide extreme cooling for the cpu. For me I would like to see better overall fans included in the kit. The ones included are great but adding some RBG function to them would be welcome.Some other Con's:-Installation can be challenging-Corsair link buggy but Corsair releases constant updates so thats a relief," In conclusion to this essay the corsair h115i is a great aio. Easy installation, excellent performance, cool, and quiet with customizable rgb lighting. The h115i is great cooler for anyone looking into the liquid cooling spectrum, a great middle ground between bulky air coolers, and expensive custom loops. Just make sure your case can fit it.",1,1
9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,3/21/2016 7:43:41 PM,Robert G.,Wow! Excellent Cooler,5," With each generation Corsair continues to improve on quality and performance. Not that long ago getting a 280MM radiator was a problem as you had to be really careful that it would fit in your case. So many cases has evolved addressing this issue that this really isn't a limitation anymore. I put this cooler in the front of a Fractal Define S and had plenty of space. Setup was 4 140mm Thermaltake Riing fans in push/pull and I have to say I was shocked at the performance. Rig was 5960X with 64GB RAM on a ASUS Sabertooth X99 board and overclocked to 4.6GHz. The amazing part was that the idle temps were 11C, ummm, seriously? I thought it was a mistake at first and checked a few different ways and that's really how cool it was. At load it would get in high 40's to low 50's. I OCd a little higher by increasing voltage to 1.4, but couldn't keep it stable at 4.8 under load and simply no need to push voltage any higher even though I was tempted....  4.6Ghz for this processor is just fine with me. Link software isn't my favorite, but it's easy to change color of the LED which is cool if you want to match the LED scheme of your internal fans. If you get quality 140mm fans then they will run virtually silent.Installation is stupid easy - another credit to Corsair for continuously trying to improve their products."," I never use the Corsair fans that come with these units because they are just loud. I hope at some point Corsair just offers some of their LED SP140MM fans as an option vs cheaping out on fans. You could argue that they just want you to buy their more expensive fans separately, but in my case I went with Thermaltake Riing which I think are superior to anything Corsair is offering right now anyway."," Fan profiles using Link software are limitless. I personally don't spend a lot of time with that, but if you really like that sort of thing you will like the options. You can even have the LED change colors once your CPU hits a certain temp. Option to enable/disable warning color change or LED entirely if you don't like it.",2,2

9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,3/10/2016 1:09:33 PM,Lawrence M.,Well done Corsair,5," The Corsair Hydro Series H115i is a long awaited 280 (140mm x 2) all in one (AIO) liquid cooler. The market for AIO coolers has traditionally been 120 or 240 only coolers. The reason for this 120mm (and multiples thereof) ubiquity is that most case manufactures have only 120mm fan mounts. Specifically for this review my favorite manufactures, Silverstone, Lian li, In Win have almost exclusively 120mm based chasses’. The only exception to this has been Corsair, who to my surprise has both 120mm and 140mm support in almost all of their cases (Graphite, Obsidian, Carbide & Vengeance). I had owned the Corsair Vengeance C70 Military Green case once upon a time which supports a top 240 & 280 reservoir and although I mounted a custom 240 I always felt the case was not being fully utilized….I had at the time wished there was an easier way to liquid cool such a system AND fill the radiator mounting space….introduce the H115, the answer to my desires unfortunately 2 years late.Unlike most AIO liquid coolers made by corsair, (and most other manufactures), the pump which is embedded in the waterblock was powered by Molex….a power plug which dates back to 1986 when hard disk drives were powered by them (I still have a HDD which is 10in x 6in pulled from an only 1986 Mac). Therefore many PSU manufactures have kept this power plug in their lineup because although HDDs now use SATA many CD/DVD drives still use Molex. Given that the modern trend has been away from optical media most users have no HDD or perhaps slim HDDs, which are powered by slim SATA power plugs, or perhaps choose to have no CD/DVD drive at all. Therefore there really is no place for Molex connectors in modern builds and Corsair is the first AIO manufactured that ive seen who has realized this and by choosing to power their H115i pump with a SATA power plug WILL help push this long obsolete Molex power connector out of cases; Hats off to you Corsair.Having spent may hours/days removing air bubbles from custom liquid loops which notoriously cause pump noise I was pleasantly surprised by how silent the pump operated, and thus how bubble free the liquid must truly be in this AIO system. I really enjoyed how large the cooling plate was and that it is made of copper, a relatively inexpensive and exceptional heat conductive material. I have seen other manufactures use other, cheaper, materials and there are certainly effects on temperatures. I love the color of the fans. Previous generations of Corsair's AIO coolers have been boring black fans which were a little loud. These off grey fans are stylish and relatively quiet", This product didnt come out sooner!," Should you buy the Corsair H115i?If you have a case which can accept a dual 140mm (280mm) radiator:YES! The Corsair H115i is an exceptionally easy to install AIO cooler which is the first ive known which accommodates those of us who have room for a 280If you have room for a 280 AND you have space issues in your case:YES! The Corsair H115i has eliminated the Molex plug for the SATA standard and given that you most likely are also powering a few SSDs/HDDs you can use a free SATA power plug for your pump.If you want to liquid cool your computer without investing in a custom loop:Yes, a custom loop will cost you more time, money, and aggravation….and for many users the H115i is going to make many customers very happy. However the only cases that Ive seen which can accommodate a 280 are Corsair Cases so worst case you’ll be accused of a fanboy which isn’t the worst thing given how well designed the Corsair H115i turned out to beAs for me, I’m impressed",1,2
9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,3/8/2016 7:15:51 PM,Nicholas A.,Top of the line cooler- No corners cut by Corsair on this one!!!!,5," This is a MUST HAVE for anyone that takes cooling your CPU seriously. No more bulky Heatsinks that are sucking up space from the appearance. This is very quite. The instructions for those that have never installed one on a CPU are really straight forward and to the point. Very nice pictures to show the steps in the instructions. The radiator is HUGE and does its job with perfection. The CPU will run cool, even when overclocked. Multiple CPU sockets will work with this cooler.  (Mine was an Intel i7 980X Socket LGA1366 - Oldy but Goody) Corsair link allow for a really cool option to customize the LED color based on a few factors. In my case, I had it set to turn red when it was getting to a set temperature and blue when it was under the temperature to show it was cool.  Great cosmetic appearance for the inside of my HAF932 case. The tool free mounting is one of my favorites, I hate using tools to get these mounted, this just makes it so much easier to mount and to me was about 90-75% faster. Per Corsair, this has a 5 yr warranty. I know NewEgg shows 2 on the warranty part for this product, but if you to the online portion of Corsairs website and also look at the information provided (its on the box too), you get 5 yrs for the Hydro Series. 2yrs may be for the fan but not the radiator."," None, the product works and works well. Never a disappointment with Corsair products."," I have had many Corsair products that are self-contained cooling units, this one by far exceeded my expectations. Newegg shows a 2 yr warranty when this is clearly a 5 yr warranty. Its on the Corsair website and also shows right on the box and the materials inside the box.

9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,3/8/2016 7:01:42 PM,Charles E.,Geat sealed water cooling system!,5, -Slick styling-Easy installation-great instructions-Made by Corsair-140mm fans-fairly quiet fans-larger rad-awesome performance, -It won't fit into just any case and some people might have to either buy a new case or modify the one they own. Also some might find that installing it outside of the case to be the only way to use this unit with their current tower.," I'm a big fan of water cooling. I have been running custom water loops for many years with great success. About 2 years ago I was building a new gaming rig and decided to try out a sealed cooling system from Corsair. What a great idea! One of my biggest gripes about running a custom loop is having to clean out the system every so often, refreshing the water and so forth. The nice thing about a sealed system is I do not ever have to open it up and clean anything. Just hook it up and it is done. Performance wise a custom loop will provide better cooling but for the ease of setup, use and lack of maintenance; a sealed cooling system from Corsair is really a solid choice.I at this time own three different Corsair water cooling systems and each one has been fantastic. Two are installed in gaming rigs while the 3rd is installed in my HTPC. I have not had any issues in the last two years at all. The H115i is not exception. This water cooling system keeps my temps at idle in the teens! I'm talking 18-20c average here. At extreme load I am seeing a max of 45c. This is really good considering my 6600K is running at 4.5GHz. I couldn't be happier with this cooling system. Take it from me; I know water and though I know I can get better cooling with a custom loop, this Corsair kit really does a fine job and makes life easy. I doubt I will ever go back to custom loops again.As a last note I would like to say the stock fans are really quite quiet. The larger 140mm fans help expel the hot air from the rad and the sound IMO is very minimal. Not a quiet as my Scythe Gentle Typhoon's that I ran with my custom loop but quiet enough that they do not bother me at all.Corsair know what they are doing. Just buy this kit and thank me later.",None,None

Corsair is really branching out in the hi-end PC gaming world,5, - Super Easy Install- Solid Build/Construction- Big 280mm Radiator (make sure you case has the space to install it)- 2x 140mm Fans- Braided Tubing- All mounting hardware included (for Intel and AMD builds)- LED light customization (not crucial but still cool)- Well packaged, None.," I was pretty excited to get this puppy installed. I installed it on a mid-tier gaming rig I built for my 6 soon to be 7 year old son. The specs of the build were as follows:Motherboard: ASUS M5A78L-M/USB3 AM3+ AMD 760G + SB710 USB 3.0 HDMI uATX AMD MotherboardProcessor: AMD FX-4350 Vishera Quad-Core 4.2 GHz Socket AM3+ 125W FD4350FRHKBOX Desktop ProcessorRAM: CORSAIR Vengeance 8GB (2 x 4GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1866 (PC3 15000) Desktop Memory Model CMZ8GX3M2A1866C9BSSD: SAMSUNG 850 EVO 2.5"" 250GB SATA III 3-D Vertical Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) MZ-75E250B/AM PSU: Rosewill ARC-M650, ARC Series 650W Modular Power Supply, 80 PLUS Bronze Certified, Single +12V Rail, Intel 4th GenCase: A hand-me-down case I had lying around.This guy was a super easy install and was done within about 10 minutes. The construction of the pump and radiator feels really solid and is the build quality I've learned to expect from Corsair. Everything fit nice and snug and there was no issue with piecing the cooling system together. I used everything as is including the thermal paste that came pre-installed. Mounting the fans and radiator to the case was a breeze as well.Under idle, the temperature was in the range of 68-77 degrees Fahrenheit. Under load, the temperature only increased to the range of 86-97 degrees Fahrenheit. WOW! Using the software that was included, I am running the balanced mode as the most intense game that is being played in Plants Vs Zombies Garden Warfare 2. I will mention that the fans run a bit loud once the machine is under load. This isn't a problem for me because this is a gaming rig that is installed in my son's room. When the machine is idle or under a low load, the fan's are almost 100% silent, however.This cooler was probably a bit over-kill being installed on a mid-range gaming system, but this is the first liquid CPU cooler I've had the pleasure of reviewing. My son thinks it is awesome as he likes the LED light matching his fans' LEDS and he just can't believe his ""electric"" computer has ""liquid"" keeping it cool. He's truly amazed.This is a really awesome CPU cooler and fits so many different modern/newer processors from Intel and AMD. I would definitely recommend this cooler when you are building your next gaming rig. This was the first time I've every installed a liquid cooler as I don't game much. However, this cooler has sold me on liquid cooling versus traditional air cooling.",0,1
9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,3/7/2016 8:59:53 PM,Anonymous,Excellent cooler,5, Solid build qualityGreat Cooling PerformanceVery Quiet, Unit it large. So make sure you have a case with 2 120/140mm fan mounts next to each other to mount the radiator. If you have a smaller case and want to try water coolers Corsair H60-H90 models will serve you well.," This is a review for the Corsair Hydro Series H115i water cooler. This is a AIO (all in one solution) for CPU liquid cooling.The product arrived undamaged and extremely well packaged (both the newegg packaging and corsairs retail box packaging).The first thing you will notice is how large the radiator is. At 280mm the radiator is huge. The benefit of this is the larger the radiator the more heat can be theoretically dissipated by fans cooling blowing on the radiator. Because of this size make sure your case is large enough for it. All the cases I buy for my personal use have (2) 120/140mm fan mounts on the top of the case. Case size is really your only major hurdle for proper and headache free installation. If you case isn't large enough please try any corsair Hydro series between models H60 through H90 these are smaller radiator units which will still allow you to get the benefits of liquid cooling.The build quality is extremely high for the unit. Nice black and grey color scheme, with Corsair logos on both the CPU block and also on the side of the radiator. The tubes come with nice sleeves. It's a well built, solid water cooler. When it's all put together it's very sharp and clean.For anyone who might be hesitate to try water cooling, don't be. If you have experience install large after market air coolers, or removing/adding backplates for those air coolers. Then you have enough experience to install this. Plus there Videos from corsairs YouTube channel.The first step is to get the back plate setup for you your platform socket type. Then you install the radiator and fans. Then you attach the CPU block and tighten it on. Lastly connect the power cables, and the cable for the corsair link. From start to finish it took me roughly 15 minutes from package opening to fully installed. If this is your first attempt  it can take 30+ minutes if you are unfamiliar and taking your time to make sure you follow installation steps properly. For cooling performance you won't beat liquid cooling. Even the best air coolers fall short. I was able to cool a Intel Skylake i7-6800k with ease. Compared to air coolers I normally use I was able to get temps 6C and lower while overclocked at 4.8ghz and at full load. The unit remained very quiet.The Corsair link software you download from Corsairs website I was using version 4.2.0.162 that was released 1/26/16. From this software you can adjust temperature preferences. You can set target temperature lower target temps will mean faster fan speed on the radiator, and also increased pump speed to move the liquid faster. Doing so will increase the sound of the unit. But even with the most aggressive temperature targets and picking the highest fan/pump speed with the case fully closed, the sound being produced wasn't an issue. Overall this is a fantastic product, with exceptional cooling. You won't be disappointed*Edit as of right now Corsair link 4.2.1.42 was released today 3/7/16. Will update soon",None,None
9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,3/7/2016 2:09:37 AM,Bryan K.,King of Cool,5," As with every Corsair product made in recent years, the little premium you pay on top gets you legendary build quality and fantastic support. This all-in-one (AIO) water cooler is no different. If you are wanting to overclock the heck out of your CPU, but don't want to mess with custom loops then this is what you want. The large 280mm radiator will help you dissipate loads of heat and quickly at that. The included mounting hardware is great as usual and is quick to install on your socket of choice.You also have the ability to customize the illuminated logo to match any LED lights or fans you may already have in your system to give it that little extra personal touch.Again, this is clearly a product for the overclocker and enthusiasts who are not afraid at the possibility of pulling out the dremel if needed. I cannot emphasize this enough; if you are not overclocking (like a mad scientist) then Corsair has other models better suited for your needs. I tossed this on my FX-8120 @ 4.7Ghz (a 1.6Ghz overclock!) and it didn't break a sweat. I tried going higher but I was actually running into RAM issues, NOT CPU heat issues."," Because of the added size, this will most likely only fit in cases specifically made to accommodate a much larger radiator assembly. This isn't a deduction or real negative, just please be aware you will need to plan ahead if you want to use this AIO cooler. The tubing is also quite rigid so you're limited in the positions you will be able to finagle it into place."," Some reviewers have listed loud fans as a con which I don't think is very fair. ""Extreme Performance"" is in the name and for most high end PC components that is mutually exclusive from silent or near-silent. This AIO water cooler is for builders who want to achieve very high over clocks on their CPU's and not have to worry about how to dissipate heat so they can have a stable frequency. Yes, the fans can get loud when pushed but if you are wanting a quieter but still high performing cooler, Corsair has other models better suited for you.**Full disclosure, I was offered this product for review purposes**",1,1
9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,3/5/2016 3:43:21 PM,Paul E.,A Must for 6- and 8-Core Processors,4," -Raw performance that an air-cooler cannot match, period. (see below for specific test results)-Installation is easy and headache-free. (at least in full-tower cases designed for watercooling)-Customization and data acquisition through Corsair Link is excellent!-Fairly quiet at low fan speeds - almost air-cooling quiet."," -Powerful but excessively loud fans, especially at high RPM.  An option to purchase the bare cooler would be excellent!-Loss of functionality with Corsair Link.  Keeping the 4-pin comm port from previous coolers would have been perfect for people like me with another Corsair Link component (the HX1000i PSU in my case).-No pump RPM control without Corsair Link."," This CPU cooler appears to be either a slight re-design of, or a renaming of the H110i GTX.  The pump/block and radiator appear to be unchanged, but there may be changes to the fans between versions.  Overall, the cooler feels well-built – the accents on the sides of the radiator, the braided tube coverings, and the RGB light inside the pump/block make this cooler stand out.  I directly compared this cooler to the best air-cooling setup I could find – I won’t name names, but it’s a dual-tower style cooler that is thermally alright, if you catch my drift.  It was equipped with three very quiet 150mm PWM fans.  With my 5820k running at 4.5GHz at 1.35v, Corsair Link (connected to my HX1000i PSU) indicated a power draw of about 320W during a Linpack-based stress test, most of that power being consumed by the CPU.  That’s a tall order for any cooler, especially an air cooler.  My CPU temperatures were 74-86C using the air cooler, and a good application of Prolimatech PK-1 thermal paste.  Idle temperatures were 33-38C after an hour to stabilize at ~19C ambient.  These temperatures are too hot for my comfort, and I would have bumped my CPU down to 4.4GHz to allow vCore to be lower.  Installing the H115i was much easier than wrestling with a large air cooler- and due to this, it was much easier to mount and remove the pump/block to check thermal paste distribution than with a huge tower of aluminum.  I elected to remove the TIM that came pre-installed, and used PK-1.  After I installed the H115i and allowed the thermal paste to set for a few hours under varying load, CPU core temperatures were 65-74C during the same stress test, with the same ambient temperature (~19C) – an incredible drop of 12C at the highest core temperature, and there was 3C less temperature spread between cores.  Idle temps were 29-34C after allowing to stabilize with the pump on Performance and the fans at minimum speed.  Idle temperature was mostly unaffected by turning the pump down to Quiet mode, but there was an audible difference.  Under quiet conditions and low load, the H115i was just slightly louder than my (VERY quiet) air cooling setup.  If listening closely, both the pump and the fans make an audible clicking noise.  I let the fans run for several hours blowing up (the orientation I intended on using them in), and they did not quiet down at all, unfortunately.  That said, the clicking is only audible within a foot or so of the case when it is closed.  If this bothers you (like it does me), you may want to budget for swapping the fans for a quieter 140MM PWM option.  Under full load, the fans are very loud, much louder than my air cooler – Corsair rates them at 45dB, and they are every bit of it.  They make an unpleasant hum/groan at all higher RPM, which is another reason to grab a better PWM fan.  Even dissipating nearly 300W of power, though, I found that the fans did not need to be set anywhere near 100%.  The happy zone that found was 63-65%, which ended up being a little bit louder than my previous setup at 100% (which WAS necessary), but still maintaining 65-75C temperatures during a stress test.  I am slightly frustrated with Corsair’s inconsistent implementation of Corsair Link – the H115i does not have the 4-pin comm port that was present on previous coolers like the H80i and H100i, meaning that in order to have both my HX1000i and H115i connected via USB, I need to get creative, give up my USB2.0 ports on the front of my case, or lose Corsair Link functionality on the cooler or PSU.  I was eager to use Corsair Link from the time that I got my HX1000i, but the inconsistency noted here, along with the long-standing unavailability of the Commander hub (which wouldn’t help in this case, due to the lack of a 4-pin comm port), have been major roadblocks to enjoying an otherwise very good system.  The software is easy to use and has great functionality, but the barriers to entry can be difficult to overcome, as I have found over the past year or so.  I’d be willing to forego Corsair Link on the H115i, but that is the only way to control the speed of the pump!  I refuse to lose such important functionality, as I value having a near-silent computer when load and temperatures are low.  This was easily possible when the CPU was air cooled, and I’d prefer to leave it that way if there is no acceptable workaround.  Overall, the H115i did exactly what it needed to do to dethrone my (very nice) air cooler… It provided much better cooling capacity and lower temperatures (allowing a higher overclock, in my case) while being competitively quiet, at least when not under full load.  Even taking into account the clicky fan and pump, as well as the less-than-ideal position I’m put in with Corsair Link, the H115i has made a great impression, and it will definitely remain part of my computer, as long as it stands the test of time.",2,2
9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,3/4/2016 8:38:11 PM,Travis M.,Great solution to cooler performance!,5," + Pretty large heatsink, greater surface area for disappating heat+ Greater cooling over active air cooling+ Nice packaging (typical with my experience with Corsair products)+ Easy installation+ Customizable RGB lighting on the pump (though, only great for those who can actually see it)+ IMHO, the Corsair software has come a long way+ Self-contained, requiring no maintance"," - Fans are loud - though if like me, not really a con"," Not going to lie, this is my first time with a water cooler device such as this and I must say, it was a really enjoyable, first-time experience! If you require near-silence with your rig then I would recommend replacing the OEM fans as they are quite 'loud'. If you are like me and noise is not an issue, then these are fine (I have 2 server boxes and 1 dedicated NAS that run 24/7, spinning 26 fans - where disappating heat is more of a priority than running silent. To add to that, there are 4 40mm fans connected to the drive bays for each 4U chassis that sound-off like jet-engines).I installed this on a Intel i7 3770 that used to run a Noctua C14S. Idle would average 32C and load 54C in a room with an average ambient temperature of 72F. After replacing with the Corsair water-block, idle temps averaged 26C and load was 41C. Note: my CPU doesn't have the unlocked multiplier 'K' model but can raise the FSB clock a bit without making the system unstable - to 4.305 GHz; natively base frequency of 3.4 GHz, and an ""up to"" 3.90 GHz. Still a good boost.I had some tried-and-true Arctic Silver 5 laying around and replaced the goop that was pre-set from factory with it. I don't have tests for temp-differences between the two but I have used Arctic Silver 5 for years so feel more comfortable using it over anything factory.IMHO, the Corsair software has improved. I have used their software for few years or so (K70 RGB, 1000W PSU, etc.) and it has greatly improved. Also IMO, I didn't find the software a PITA to use than before.It's nice that this system is self-contained! One reason why it took me so long to endulge in water-block cooling is the maintanence aspect of it. It's nice that one can get the benefits of water-block cooling with the maintenance requirement involved.Highly recommend if looking for a cooler solution for your CPU, regardless if you are an overclock'er or not.",1,1
9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,3/3/2016 10:58:18 AM,Valentin P.,Great setup ditch air cooling for silent water cooling setup,5, pretty large and thick (might be a con for the thickness for some cases)Good tempsquite pumpeasy setup (on a proper case)price is reasonable (wish for option to purchase without fans), Stock fans pretty loudnot sure why they went with plastic backing platefinish could be lapped or at least improved then what is on the copper plate," First impressions, box looked pretty nice, I like the recycled use for the inside packaging, don’t need too fancy stuff after the first glance the packaging will go into the trash/recycle bin (better that its made out of recyclable material).  I looked at my case which I have been using the Fractal R4 cases, they were very good for sound damping and overall built.  I thought oh looks wide enough no problem! Will fit with ease.  Well long story short, no it will not fit into the R4 without a few modifications.  First you must free up the first 5 ¼ bay, 2nd you cannot install regular 140mm fans on the inside.  So regular fans must be top mounted outside the case.  Third  I did reuse my notcua round 140mm fans for the inside, 2 of them will fit, but only hold on one screw, 2nd radiator will only line up with the first 4 screws of the back top fan, rest of holes will not.  So as you can see it is possible to fit the H115i into a Fractal Design Define R4, and its good for a push pull configuration.   I recommend you get the other Fractal cases if your shopping for a new one, get the ones that support water cooling setups, those cases look even better then the old ones.Next up, the fans that come area super loud, they area as bad as the Noctua 140mm PWM AAO SSO2 IP67 3k rpm models.  Boy did I fall for those fans, yes they can push lots of air, but anything past 700-900 rpm and they becoming annoying to me, better off with over all quitter fan that can run even full speed at half the cfm but not be annoying doing so.  I keep my cases quite now, and setup for head room for the fans.  This brings me to the control and tweaking of the water setup,  I have been a big fan of the Noctua Nh-D14 air cooling, had them since they came out, very good ones.  But I will be honest in my setup I have the fans from silent (600-800 rpm) to predetermined med load value to extreme full 100% only for safety setting.  The air setup needs cycling on and off lots to keep the  temps down.  Water cooling is another world, this is such a pleasure to work with.  There are 2 variables to consider besides the fans, that is water temp and pump duty cycle.  I will say let the software do its thing with the duty cycle, and focus on water temp.  The way I setup my quite system is run the apps that I normally run, watch the temps of the water, go back and tweak the fans to be working so that the water temp does not rise too much, then leave headroom for a benchmark like realbench, so the fans kick in and you do not go too high.  I recommend using the a mobo that has great config options for your fan headers, I did not really touch the Corsair software as the Asus fan header software does great job, and I was able to tweak everything I need that way, used few fan splitters and enough for whole case of fans.  I did look at the software it is pretty configurable.Overall I am sold on water cooling systems such as this H115i, so much so that I will be buying these and configuring most of my systems with them, water does such a better job of absorbing those cpu spikes, and in todays day we still see lots of code that does not utilize all the cores and will spike a core to 100% and cause your fans to spin up and down like a rollercoaster.  I recommend this to just about anyone who knows how to build a system, if you buy with water cooling in mind then you will have a great experience for sure.",None,None

Read more in other for details.," I had a 240mm liquid cooler on my desktop and was gratefully given the opportunity to review this unit.  Corsair makes very top quality products and the performance of this product did not disappoint me.  However, I was completely caught off guard and unprepared on how big this thing was.  My desktop has a full ATX case and this radiator was a tight fit.  I just want you to know that you really need to plan ahead if you plan on purchasing this.I've always loved water coolers ever since I got my first water cooler- my main draw was that I didn't have to deal with those horrible push pins someone thought was a good idea.  Sometimes they push in fine; sometimes they don't.  I have used enough force before to bend pins on a motherboard!Installation was easy; but unlike the water cooler I had installed the mounting brackets don't actually sit tight with the initial set of screws and it will flop up and down.  THIS IS NORMAL- I wish Corsair had explained this in their manual.  It wasn't until I stumbled upon a video stating a bit of play was normal.Because of the tight space I actually had to remove the CPU power plug from my motherboard and remove all of my RAM.  The radiator slid in easily but I had to fight the hoses a little bit (but that's really not unexpected of any water cooler).  The cooler comes with thermal paste included and all you need to do is remove the plastic cover, place the pump on top of the cpu, and take the final thumb screws and secure it in place.  Magically, the mounting bracket now stays in place.  Remember to criss-cross the screws and not tighten them to one side.  Easy peasy installation with just a screwdriver and no other tools!Now for the numbers.  I have a Core i5 4670k, overclocked to 4.5GHz.  At idle the CPU is at 23C- that's 7C lower than my 240mm water cooler.  At load the CPU bounces from 40C to 50C- my 240mm cooler would hit peaks of 55-56C so this is definitely an improvement.The pump is actually pretty quiet- the fans are a little loud.  My case has 5 fans though so the sound blends in.  Want to see how quiet it can get?  You can download the Corsair link software and change the profile.  The USB data cable is a very nice touch from the pump unit.  Did you know that you can change the LED color too?!

9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,2/23/2016 10:53:13 AM,Anonymous,Better than you think,5, The build quality of this CPU cooler is excellent. Almost a work of art. The new pump design is a lot better. I had an H80i and the pump made a rattling noise on startup but went away. This new design is nice and quiet. Radiator is huge and I immediately noticed a big difference in how much more the cpu temp stays consistent. I'm running a 4ghz 8 core fx chip., Cooler Master HAF 932 this will not fit unless you know how to modify things correctly as I had to do.,,0,1
9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,2/23/2016 4:43:14 AM,Marcus A.,H115i: Not quite the performance i expected,3," Is an AIO liquid/water CPU cooler.Has a nice customizable LED feature on the block itself showing the Corsair logo and name.Corsair Link software offers some nice customizable options such as changing LED colors. Offers a ""warning"" option for reaching high or dangerous temperatures where the LED colors can change to alert users. Also has a nice customizable information page showing all around system temperatures that can be aligned to an image of your Corsair PC case. And allows you to create fan curve profiles based on certain system temperatures.Fan have pretty high static pressure.","  The biggest con is the size of the radiator. It exceeds 140x280mm by quite a bit where it shouldn't. Extra space taken up by added plastic accents with the Corsair logo width-wise and extra space taken up height-wise by spacer/standoffs for screw mounts that are longer than need be.The tubing is very rigid and no where near as flexible as other AIO liquid coolers I've worked with. Makes it very difficult to install block while holding them to any certain flexed position.The software does not allow user control of the pump speeds. There is only a Performance or Quiet setting to choose from.The included Intel 115x rear backplate & standoffs are made of very cheap malleable plastic, almost like soft rubber. While seating/screwing on the block these just turned in place and stretched/ruined the rear standoff plate. Impossible to use now so I've inserted a more capable plate made by Thermaltake.Fans are good up to ~40%, a little past that and they start to get VERY loud.I get 6-8°C higher idle temperatures than I did using a 240mm AIO water cooler. Fan profiles set exactly the same between the two. Stressed temperatures seem to be the same between the two."," Installing this in a Corsair case, claiming it fits 280mm radiators in it's top compartment, I had to seriously modify the case. Cutting ~3²"" out of the top was the only way to fit this radiator. And it still doesn't fit comfortably, it is ""jammed"" into the compartment and the top vent will not sit evenly.Comparing this to the 240mm Thermaltake Water 3.0 Extreme, the Thermaltake is a better option; it is cheaper, smaller, more flexible install options, more sturdy backplate, quieter fans, lower temperature at same fan speeds.",5,7

I'm sure that tweaking the profiles will yield better results.Price to performance is pretty good!"," This isn't a fault on Corsair at all, more of an end-user error. I had NO IDEA how BIG the radiator was going to be. I thought it was going to be a regular 280 radiator and fit it on the top of my Cooler Master 5 Pro case easily. Nope. Not at all. I was about to return it when I thought about mounting it in the front. It took a bit, but yes, this cooler will mount snugly (as if it were made for it) in the front of this case. Make sure to double check the dimensions before you buy this cooler."," Its a big radiator for a dual fan water cooler. Be on guard.It cools my OC'd AMD FX9590 wonderfully even under the quiet preset! If I were hardcore OC'ing I'd ramp up the profile a bit, but I like the quietness of this cooler.I do recommend!",2,2
9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,2/20/2016 4:22:25 PM,Brian D.,"Fantastic looks and build quality, average cooling.",4," Great pressures and air flow from the fans. Nice braided covering over the water transfer tubes. CPU block ports swivel to allow different mounting positions depending on where you install your radiator.  Fans, radiator, water cables and CPU block look great! When operating on quite mode I found the noise level to be very good. The Corsair Link program is very well designed and gives some control but not complete control over everything. The LED light is great and is fully RGB customizable. The block will turn red when the H115i reaches a certain temp, 45c by default. (That is the cooler’s temp not the CPU temp) Installation of the CPU block was really very easy. I loved the fact that this cooler can do its designed job and give you control from your OS as well as temp readouts from all heat sensors in your computer. (GPU, CPU, Cooler and Mobo)"," The cooler was very wide. While I liked the fact that I could get more surface area to cool, this could cause some serious install issues for some cases despite them allowing for a 280mm radiator. I installed the radiator prior to installing the fans and had to remove it and install the fans prior to install because I could not reach the fan screws with the radiator installed by itself (The motherboard was in the way). There was also about 1mm of clearance between my motherboard and the fans once installed so it was a tight fit. (Installed in an NZXT H440) OHH man and the cables coming out of this thing. The preinstalled cables hide decently but the USB 2.0 header cable for the Corsair Link program is kind of bulky and can get in the way. Cooling was not as great as I expected. I used the pre-installed thermal compound and I suspect I could get a few degrees cooler by swapping that out. I replaced a Hyper 212 and my temps really did not go down as much as I thought. If you are planning to overclock heavy and maintain loads on a consistent basis, these fans get loud when they go to 70 – 100%."," I love AIO coolers, period. For builds where I really want to showcase the components there really is no better way than an AIO cooler for the average consumer. This CPU block is by far one of the best looking ones I’ve seen and the braided cables and the light add that extra touch. I really was blown away at the overall quality of this cooler; from the radiator to the block and to the software it really is a “windowed” PC build dream install. If you are looking to buy an awesome looking cooler to really highlight your PC build I can really recommend this to you. It’s great for that!Other than that I would probably say to look at other options. It’s very large and could prove to cause some install issues in some cases. The water cables are longer than some AIO’s and in a tight build it could cause some issues. The cooling was great, but only on an average scale, since you could achieve these temps with a cooler that is smaller and less expensive. Overall I love this cooler and it fit my case perfectly and looks fantastic in it. Absolutely love the control and monitoring they give you with the software; so much better that just putting it in and not knowing what it’s doing. But I feel that this does not provide the “top tier” cooling that its price and ranking in the product line suggests. If I was reviewing just the functionality and looks of this product it would be a 98. And if that is more important to you than top notch cooling, then this might just be your prefect cooler. I know it is for me.",1,2
9SIA6ZP3RA2165,35-181-100,2/20/2016 1:49:10 PM,Trevor S.,Loud when cranked but very good cooling! Amazingly close performance to full custom loop.,5," - Couldn't be easier to use.  If you're worried about liquid cooling or the performance of the all in one units, there is nothing to worry about here.  Plug and play!- Very good performance from this slightly oversized  setup.  These fans seem to have really good static pressure and move a lot of air through the radiator.  The larger size of this (vs a smaller 120 single fan or this 240 dual fan setup) really helps with the cooling performance it offers.  Specifics will be listed at the end for comparison.- Looks sweet!  You get ""at a glance"" readouts simply by looking at the color of the waterblock/pump.- Software that actually works.  This shouldn't be a ""pro"" when something works as it should but it's getting rare when extra apps and software actually works as it should.  In this case it was painless to install and setup.  Another shocker was it was actually intuitive to operate."," - Can get loud you start overclocking and cranking things up.  The counter to that however is that the performance is worth it (to me anyway).- Not really fair to call this a ""con"" so much as something to pay attention to before you buy.  This is an oversized rad coming in at 280mm and not your standard thin single/dual 120mm AiO.  Make sure it will fit your case."," I run a customer loop that consist of dual pumps, dual 360 radiators and a single 120 rad.  This runs through 1/2"" tubing and cools a highly overclocked 2700K and dual 980ti that are also overclocked.  This massive liquid loop runs the CPU at ~30C with standard web surfing and music playing (very light load) while running 4.9Ghz at around 1.1v.  Per GPUz, the 980ti's sit at 28C when idle.  At load the GPUs highest temp recorded (heaven benchmark looped for several minutes) was 44C running at 1525 core/1900 memory.  Running intel burn test (brutal on CPU) the max temp is 68C.  This liquid loop cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $700-$1K for reference (never actually added it up).  You'd think there would be a massive difference between something like that and the H115i but now for something impressive.The ambient temp was the same for all tests at 68F.  The H115i Extreme kept the overclocked 2700K at 32C with the same basic web surfing and music playing.  Keep in mind the GPUs were kept on a separate loop so they weren't heating up the CPU (or whole loop) but still impressive.  Running intel burn test the temps did go higher than I would run 24/7 with the 4.9Ghz overclock and peaked around 74C before I shut it down.  Dropping the voltage and clocks down to 4.6Ghz, it never went over 65C.  I was using junk thermal paste for testing since everything was being swapped out so, with better paste I'm sure this could run 4.8 overclocked with safe temps. In the end, I would highly recommend this to anyone that's currently on air and wants to overclock their CPU.  Even if you don't overclock, which this would be overkill (nothing wrong with that!) it's nice to know you could overclock your stuff down the road should you decide to.  Much more cost effective than a custom loop and amazingly effective for the price.  Buy one, you won't regret it!!",1,2

N82E16835181103,35-181-103,9/4/2016 10:05:49 AM,MATTHEW S.,Chasing temps on the i7,4," The corsair H100i v2 is built solid, looks good and comes with a large variety of mounting options for both AMD and Intel.  The included 120mm fans push a lot of air and during low speeds are relatively quit.   I do enjoy the full RGB ability of the LED.  The corsair link software really gives you a good idea whats going on while cooling your cpu.  More on this later."," I do have quite a few cons to list for this cooler.  None are so bad that I would return it, but more so that I wish I didn't buy it and I would recommend not to as I do believe that other people would have similar preferences as I.  The first thing I noticed right out of the box was that the hose end that connected into the radiator seemed to have some type of oily liquid by the seems.  I was not sure if this was a leak or some type of left over manufacturing oil or lubricant.  I did contact corsair customer support who said “Wipe it down so that the oil is no longer present, and then sit it so that it would leak if it was leaking. Then check again for the substance. “  I did so.  Agreed to monitor it and it looks like it has not been an issue....   yet.   My second quirk with this cooler is how many wires need to come off the cpu block.  I understand the biggest feature is the corsair link software and to do its job it needs all the wires.  I just think its overkill.  Not to mention the mini usb cable comes off the cpu block the wrong direction. What an incredible oversight!  If you had no intention of using a discrete video card you could just wire straight to the motherboards USB header, but this wont be the case for most gamers.   The mini usb comes off the cpu block at a 90 degree angle.  It forces the wire to be routed towards the IO of the motherboard.  If the cable was long enough you could route it up the face of the motherboard around the back of the case and back up into the USB header, but because its too short its simply best to make this stupid looking loop and allow the wire to reverse direction.  Lastly the corsair link software itself.  It is useful, I just question to what extent.  Most of the information it monitors you can get off of other programs and I believe to get the full benefit of this software you need to have a corsair case where with enough user added information your system can have a brain of its own and do what it needs to do to keep your temps just right. So for me most of the features in the corsair link software is simply worthless."," I would say the biggest surprise of this AIO cooler was in the form of information.  Information that buying another cooler I would have never gotten.  More specifically the temperature of the H100i v2 cpu block.  Why is this so important?  Well.  Because for a long time now I have been chasing what I have felt to be high temperatures in my i7 6700K.  I have owned 2 captain 240's, the corsair H105 and now this.  This is the first time that I have seen that more than likely every cooler has done everything it could to keep the i7 temperatures down and from what I see it does it with ease.  I have my i7 overclocked to 4.5GHZ running at 1.35V.  Though stressing the cpu with aida64 can bring my i7 temps into the 70's, with this cooler I can clearly see that the cpu block temp rarely gets over 34.  What this tells me is that all the other coolers that I bought that also gave me temps in the 70's were all working just fine.   I have the LED displayed as blue while the temperature of the cpu block is below 34.  When it goes above it turns red.  The only times the cpu block temperature has gone above 34 is when I played arma3 for over an hour.  Oddly it does not even go that warm when stressing.  I rarely stress for more than 10 minutes.One last thing I forgot to mention is that the copper block on this cooler is not flat like glass and I highly recommend that the first thing you do is wipe off the stock thermal paste and put on some arctic silver 5.  I did use the stock thermal paste on the initial installation and within the first couple weeks I noticed my temperatures increasing.  Upon taking off the cooler I noticed the stock thermal paste was spread out unevenly.    Almost like it melted and dripped.  Is this even possible?  With how tight this block mounts I start to question...  Don't forget to turn your fans full on in the biosWhen I was purchasing this cooler I really was on the fence with the H105 and this one.  I had the H105 before, it worked just as good as this one but I gave it to my son.   I thought buying this cooler would outperform all the others.  This is just not the case.  The added benefit  of having the LED change from blue to red is nice, but the extra wires really pushes me away.  Knowing now what I didn't know then I would have bought the H105 again in heart beat.",3,5

For me, the pump failed randomly, and luckily i had my spare cooler on hand (air cooler) however the damage had already been done, my motherboard was fried and now it cannot register my memory sticks, and i have yet to discover if those too are broken. Corsair and watercooling company's notoriously refuse to repay the damage they do to their consumers machines even though it is clear the failure of their component resulted in the destruction of my motherboard and RAM.

So, a quick trip to Home Depot to pick up some #6 .032 black fiber washers and problem solved.When tightening the standoffs for the Intel backing plate on the motherboard the backing plate is not drawn up tight against the back of the motherboard. After studying this dilemma for about 15 minutes I went ahead and mounted the water pump on the cpu, and the big thumbscrews provided tightened everything up just fine, and the water pump was secure.

The unit tubes also run extremely close to the dual EVGA GeForce GTX960 cards which I was concerned about rubbing and wear on. I found that the customized settings of the pump, the color of the LED, and the bottom placement of the cooler allows the entire processor to run between 98 and 102* F on a consistent basis even when gaming. I had to remove it completely when I had to modify the placement prior to attaching it to the CPU however, I had not locked it down so the plastic guard served to be pretty decent for protecting the thermal paste already applied to the CPU block. As I built my system to not have to overclock it due to matching the memory to the CPU speed, this thing runs under 120* F in the box on benchmark tests. Proper airflow, the right amount of fans and negative airflow are the key to enabling this this unit to perform at peak performance and keep your chip cool.

N82E16835181103,35-181-103,4/12/2016 4:25:27 AM,Alexander M.,Great cooler for overclocked and gaming rigs!,4," After a month of having testing this device, I can say this one nice liquid cooler. Out of the box you get the Radiator/Pump, 2 fans, the back plates for holding it in place on the motherboard and instruction booklet and warranty information. It comes with a 5 year warranty, which is great as most of us usually want to keep our computers setup for that long before we build a new one. Setup was relatively easy for me due to my case allowing me to access the backside of the motherboard without removing it from the case…others might not have this luxury, but it generally takes a couple minutes of getting the bracket placed just right and getting that first side tightened in. The corsair link software is nice to monitor the temps of the CPU and can give you some insight as to what performance setting you want to set the fans at while doing certain tasks. The neat thing with the LED built into the device is that now you can adjust the color to match your build’s color. The fans are super quiet and you’ll really hear the pump/radiator more than them, but not too much where it is distracting. (just a low hum when you put your ear right next to your case…of course this depends on your case as some might let out more noise than others) The temps while I game usually remain in the 20’s to 30’s as most of the games I play are older games…some hardcore cpu-intensive games did get up around 40-50. I did notice the temperatures do hold pretty steady while gaming or doing other CPU intensive tasks."," There are a few cons with this device I found while installing/using. The hoses that house the liquid are a bit “cumbersome” in that they are hard to maneuver around. It took me a bit to get them to fit exactly the right way in my case. The fans could use a bit longer cabling…I could not get one of them to plug into my motherboard, but luckily my case had a fan header on the back to plug into…others might not be so lucky. This is a big cooler and some cases/motherboards might have issues with fitting it in. You might run into some fan clearance issues or like I said before have trouble getting the hoses to fit to your design. Compared to air coolers this is almost 2-3 times the price and only provides maybe 3-7 degrees difference. (more if you have a lower end air cooler)"," I would recommend to those who have overclocked their CPU and play pretty CPU- intensive games. As we head into the future, more and more games are going to rely on the CPU and you want a dependable cooler to keep it nice and cool while playing them. Cosair has been making great coolers for a while now and I have owned probably 2-3 of their previous products and have never had an issue with any of them. Even if I did, their Warranty usually covered any issue I might have.",2,3

So when the chance to upgrade to the V2 came around I knew that this was going to be an excellent cooler.  The quality of this unit is beyond my V1 unit.  Everything seems to be tighter and more refined.  The software is better and easier to work with as well. Temperatures are around the same on my rig.  I am running an AMD FX-8350 and at idle I'm around 56 F with the fans on low.  When I push the CPU during a game, Guild Wars 2 for example, the system gets up to around 65 F before I have the fans on the radiator set to ramp up.  At this point the noise goes up (acceptable, I have headphones) and the temps drop back to 56F.  I have it scheduled to not immediately drop the fan speeds back down when an acceptable CPU temperature is reached so that things don't constantly vary between loud and quiet while the temperatures yo-yo up and down.",0,1
N82E16835181103,35-181-103,3/27/2016 3:15:15 PM,Brandon W.,"Good overall, just a little strange at parts",4," As expected from a good cooler, it keeps my CPU nice and cool. I idle in single digit degrees Celsius; games can get in the low- to mid-20s. A little while of Prime95 stress testing put me in the mid-30s. Overall, pretty solid improvement over my Noctua DH-14.Speaking of air cooling, the fans that cool the radiator are quiet. You’ll hear much more of the radiator itself than the fans. That was one thing that pleasantly surprised me, as one of my concerns was that I’d have to hear some constant pumping noise. Instead, it’s more like a low hum. Granted, it is a constant, consistent hum, but a low hum nonetheless.Other than those things, it’s a pretty straightforward cooler that does a solid job with minimal noise."," It’s not easy to install in a way that cable management is also easy. The cables on the fans are not long enough to reach to one of the cable management ports in my case (immediately above the row of ports/top left of CPU, top right of CPU near drive bays). What ends up happening is I can get the cords over to one port, then I just have to tie them to cords that actually reach into one of the slots. The reason this may be a problem is because the fans can easily get caught on or repeatedly hit the cables if you don’t find a place to stow them. This happened when I first powered up my computer after the installation, as one had come loose where I had put it and fell once I stood my tower upright. It certainly doesn’t make for a pretty sound.Another thing is the mini USB cable that appears to provide some power to the heatsink portion of the cooler. Perhaps for the light that is on there, I’m not sure -- I could probably find out in the manual. This cable also isn’t long enough to go in a cable management port and reach the USB pins on the bottom of the board (which typically is where USB is). Again, stash the cable to the side and hope that the computer doesn’t really move."," Much about this installation was unclear, and I sometimes had to go back and take some stuff off because I had something that wasn’t either the correct part or it wasn’t in the proper configuration. Here are some things to note if you get this cooler:- remember to check for rubber stoppers where the radiator hooks to the case. This cooler didn’t come with any, so you’ll have to hope your case does- there are 3 types of risers, and for some reason, the AMD and one of the Intel ones look very similar. If you’re installing for an Intel cooler, flip ahead to the AMD section before putting on your risers to make sure you have the ones for Intel.- the cooler already has the Intel heatsink on it; the only one you’ll see in the box is for AMD coolers- you will need your CPU bracket to install this cooler, or at least, the recommendation appears to be to have this. If you previously had an aftermarket cooler (like I did, the Noctua DH-14), you might’ve remove the bracket because that cooler didn’t need it. Dig it out of a box and put it back on, because this one does.- while I’m not 100% certain, I highly doubt you’ll be able to reach your GPU with this. Considering the hassle I had getting it to properly fit my CPU, I’m not even going to try on my GPU.",2,2
N82E16835181103,35-181-103,3/24/2016 5:45:26 AM,Darrell L.,"Top notch cooling at a huge cost, and I’m not just talking about price.",3, 5 year warranty is nice.  I hear they will replace your parts that get water damaged.  That’s nice service.  You will certainly get top notch cooling at a good handful of degrees warmer than ambient... but...," I know watercooling sounds so “cool” and is so tempting.  I fell for it too.  But when I got it, I noticed something.  It was a lot louder than my Noctua 14.  And barley cooler.  And the pump noise, that vibration is audible too, and really REALLY annoying after a while.  And I was totally confused until I started doing some research and comparisons.  The benchmarks don’t lie, let me summarize:  While this water cooler does cool about 3° better than watercooling, it does so at over twice as loud of other cheaper high end air coolers.  (over 12db louder) And silence is golden to me.  I don’t want something that sounds like a muffled hair dryer on high and a pump drone noise on low.  Only people who have never built a computer before don’t care about sound levels.  If you want watercooling performance at 30dB (silent) instead of 43-60dB (that’s not twice as loud, dB is a logarithmic scale, 30-60 magnitude is 1000 not 100) I recommend getting the The Thermalright True Spirit 140.  At ~$50 it’s half the price, half the size, half the noise, on par with performance and you never never have to worry about the water eventually leaking or the pump dying out.  Water eventually wears everything down, anyone ever had an aquarium? Pumps don’t last forever. The pump, the tubs, the water block, the radiator, and all the connections is a lot of failure points. But let’s not worry about that,  let’s say it’s going to be perfect and run forever, but if you just focus on performance (sound levels and performance) and price, this does not make sense. I know a lot of watercooling fanboys will not like this.  I’m just trying to save you some possible headaches and money.  Get a Thermalright True Spirit 140 or a Noctua 14/15 and use some Phobya LM thermal paste (the best as of the writing of this review, you can buy it here at newegg) and enjoy the silence with no worries and top notch performance. Maybe watercooling will get a smaller quieter better performing solution one day soon, but that day is not today. "," Googling around the internet, Yes there are reports of this leaking, yes this brand new one, yes this V2. Yes this is just a rebranded H100i GTX. That’s kind of nerve racking for someone that *needs* their computer working all day every day.  It's not worth it for me, but maybe you're deaf and don't need a computer to be working, and you like hassle, and need those extra 3 degrees that this water gives over other high end air solutions, this could be good for you.",5,14
N82E16835181103,35-181-103,3/23/2016 12:21:36 PM,Matthew C.,Simple and effective,5, This cooler works very well and it was very easy to install it on my AMD FM2 5800k APU. I was able to make it fit in a micro ATX case but just barely.  Quiet operation and it cools very well as my APU is now overclocked 800mhz. and is still running 15c cooler than it was at stock speeds with the stock air cooler. The Corsair link software works great for monitoring and making adjustments to the fan and pump speeds as well as changing the light color to anything you want on all three of the performance settings.  The build quality is top notch with the system sealed and ready for use straight out of the box. Works with just about any modern processor., There is no easy way to mount the radiator on the outside without making a large hole in the case due to the coolant lines being connected and sealed shut so make sure you have the room on the inside or be ready to make a hole large enough for the block to fit through. The Corsair link software doesn't read the APU temperature correctly but most software doesn't., This is my first liquid cooler and I'm impressed. It was super simple to install and it works just like it should. I'm amazed at the difference in temps with my APU running 800mhz over stock speeds and still getting a 15c drop in temp. Under a max load it tops out at 42c but stays at 25c most of the time and all while on the quiet setting.,0,1
N82E16835181103,35-181-103,3/20/2016 12:31:51 PM,Ari A.,Improvement on earlier version,4," I compared this cooler back-to-back against the original H100i cooler on the same system. In short, Corsair has tweaked the design to optimize it, but it's not radically better. Basically, the radiator is more efficient and the fans run at lower RPM. I found that in Quiet Mode (using CorsairLink's presets), the temperatures were actually 2C higher both at load and idle, while noise levels were the same at idle but 2-3dB lower at load.The real changes are in ""Performance"" mode, which was intolerably loud before. Now Performance mode yields temperatures similar to the previous cooler's Quiet mode, but with slightly lower noise levels."," Don't kid yourself - lower RPMs do lead to higher temperatures. There is no way this cooler can match the old H100i with it's ultra-loud 2700RPM fans.Also, while installation has been simplified versus the H100i (much better bracket, no SATA power cable), the hoses are so thick that they actually have become hard to bend. And because of this issue, I found that they basically touched my rear 120mm case fan. This wasn't a problem with the older H100i.Finally, despite being the same size class, this cooler is actually thicker than the H100i. Whereas the H100i fit perfectly in my Corsair Carbide 500R's radiator compartment, the H100i v2 is too thick to fit without the case's top panel bulging."," Interestingly, by removing the SATA power connection that the older H100i used, the H100i v2 now draws power directly from the fan header, and it seems that motherboard controls will affect both fan speeds and pump speed. I didn't find anything in the manual regarding whether this is safe, but typically, coolers do not allow you to slow down the pump. Doing so most definitely allowed amazingly low noise levels at idle, but long-term this could cause a problem.",4,5

Even if your mid-tower accomodates 2 x 120mm top-of-the-case  fans you may find that the thickness/bulk of the Corsair H100i V2 makes it extend down into the case far enough to interfere with the rear exhaust fan, RAM slots or motherboard component heatsinks. The layout of your motherboard plays a part in determining this as well because it's common for RAM slots to be located at the top edge of the board; also, some voltage regulators or chipsets have bulky heatsinks which stick up far enough to prevent the Corsair from fitting.Any fan settings above the quietest are .... well .... not quiet!See Other Thoughts below ....

N82E16835181103,35-181-103,3/13/2016 1:28:08 PM,William W.,Corsair H100i v2 Water Cooler Review,4," I tested the Corsair Hydro Series™ H100i v2 Extreme Performance Water / Liquid CPU Cooler kit. This kit is designed to replace your standard CPU heat sink fan (air-cooled) with a water-cooled system. Water cooling while more complex, has the potential to carry more heat away from your CPU than air does. If the goal is to reduce the temperature of the CPU processor to enable or improve on the over-clocking experience, or to eliminate CPU clock throttling caused by weak OEM HSF units, water cooling can help. The increased cooling can also allow for greater over-clocking on existing systems. Note over-clocking is dependent on many variables and your speed improvements may vary. IBM mainframes used water cooling for years. So its a proven method for cooling advanced CPU's Corsair water cooling kits are sold in either single or double-wide fan/radiator configurations. Generally speaking the more fans the greater the cooling capacity. Please note that higher capacity kits tend to have higher RPM fans, which can generate more noise. The model H100i v2 kit has a dual 120mm fan radiator and is one of the higher cooling capacity rated kits that Corsair offers. As a result it takes up more space inside the computer case than a single fan radiator kit.The kit's cold plate/pumping unit is compatible with the following processor sockets: Intel LGA 1151Intel LGA 1150Intel LGA 1155Intel LGA 1156Intel LGA 1366Intel LGA 2011Intel LGA 2011-3AMD AM2AMD AM3AMD FM1AMD FM2The kit is well-made and the hoses are designed to rotate where they attach to the cold plate/pump unit for more flexibility during installation. The radiator hoses are fixed and do not rotate where they attach to the radiator unit. The hoses appear to be made out of durable material. USB Link monitoring software can be downloaded free of charge from Corsair. More on this Link App later. The cold plate has a mirror polished copper base to enhance heat transfer between it and the CPU. It comes coated with the common gray heat sink dope that is designed to melt and flow at normal CPU temperatures to improve heat transfer.It's best not to scrimp on the purchase price of one of these water cooling kits. Water and computers obviously do not mix and the last thing you want is a hose or water block springing a leak and spraying water all over your expensive computer electronics. From my past experience in using the Corsair kits, they are well-made and will not leak when installed in the manner recommended by the manufacturer. While you can purchase your own home-brew: water blocks, pumps, hoses and radiators and build your own custom water cooling system, you always run the risk of separate components developing leaks, airlocks and eventually destroying your high-end system. The ready made kits like those from Corsair and other vendors with their factory-sealed water loops are the most cost-effective and the best way to go in my personal experience as a system builder.The Corsair H100i v2 kit includes: 1) Dual fan - 240mm radiator, 2) 120mm PWM Fans (rated 2400 RPM @ 37.7 db-A scale), 1) Cold Plate/Pump Unit, Mounting Brackets, Mounting Hardware, sealed cooling loop, and installation guide. Monitoring/control software can be downloaded separately from Corsair's support web site.Corsair recommends to attach the included Corsair Link USB cable to a spare USB header on your motherboard and then download the free Corsair USB Link software to control the following features: You can customize cooling performance, monitor coolant and CPU temperatures, and change the color of the RGB LED lighting from the default white to match your system, or to change color based on temperature readings and other inputs. This definitely adds to the coolness factor!With a sealed loop system there is no need to ever top-off the water level due to leakage or evaporation. System maintenance is thereby reduced and reliability is increased. Sealed loop systems are the most cost-effective, versus custom built cooling loops. These positives all make sealed loop systems the smart way to go for those new to system building."," The larger diameter hoses used on the Corsair H100i v2 kit, while offering better water circulation capacity, have the downside of being rather stiff and hard to bend. Due to the degree of stiffness, I am a little bit concerned about the amount of torque load being applied to the water block and eventually to the motherboard. Some motherboards may warp more easily than others. One solution might be to soak the hoses in hot water just prior to installation to help soften them up for easier forming.While this is a minor con, I thought it bore an explanation. Corsair's motherboard fan wiring only supports 3-wire fan connections. The fourth blue fan lead that normally allows your motherboard to use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to regulate the CPU fan speed is not included in the Corsair fan header harness that connects in place of your CPU fan connection. Note the plug will still connect to a standard 4-pin CPU fan header to supply 12 VDC power to the pump and radiator fan. Additional circuitry located inside the water block takes over for the PWM fan control on your motherboard and relies on the Corsair Link App to control the radiator fans speeds. If you don't download and install the recommended Corsair Link App, your fans will default to operating at full speed and can generate a considerable amount of fan noise in this mode. Just a guess, but this might be the source of the noise complaints from other reviewers. With the USB Link App installed I would recommend to set the fans to the mid-level speed setting for the best compromise between fan noise and cooling efficiency.The fan output cabling due to its parallel design only has the ability to monitor one of the two connected radiator fans for rotational speed. If the fan connected to the end of the fan cable were to seize-up, the monitoring software would never detect the problem, because the 3rd tachometer lead connection is missing from part of the fan harness. This is a cost saving compromise to eliminate the need for a second fan control channel and cable.Lastly, Corsair recommends to mount the radiator fans installed to pull air into the case, versus exhausting it outward. In their instruction guide they diagram the radiator mounted to the underside of a case top with the two fans then mounted underneath the radiator to form an assembly. This goes against common sense in my opinion. Heat rises in tower cases and tends to stagnate near the top  inside of the case. Every tower case I have ever worked with was designed to pull air in through the lower front panel and lower sides of the case and then exhaust the hot air out through the top, or via a high, rear mounted case fan. This is done to improve cooling for the hard drives and graphics card(s) and this system then relies on a top mounted, or high mounted rear case fan(s) to pull any accumulated heat upward and out of the case. With good air flow the temperature inside the case should remain only few degrees above the room ambient temperature where the system is located.Reversing this normal air flow direction effectively kills the chimney effect that occurs inside the case and can result in a higher internal case temperatures in my experience. Yes pulling outside ambient air over the radiator does help its cooling efficiency, but at the cost of a poorly ventilated tower case? I don't think its worth the bother to disrupt the normal case airflow patterns for a slight improvement in the water cooling system efficiency.I have achieved better cooling results with these water cooling kits by mounting the fans to the underside of the case top, then mounting the radiator to the underside of the fans. I install the fans to pull air up through the radiator and then exhaust it out the top of the case. This maintains the case designer's preferred airflow pattern, while still providing good airflow across the Corsair radiator. While this may make the assembly process more cumbersome, I believe the final results are well worth the added effort. Keep in mind that radiators generally perform best when the air mover is mounted to pull air through the radiator, versus trying to push air through the radiator. This also results in lower fan noise that the added turbulence would cause."," Unfortunately the 240mm radiator supplied in the Corsair H100i v2 kit was too thick to fit into my existing Antec 300 v2 midsize tower case. Typically you will need a mid-tower case or larger, with a bottom mounted power supply and two 120mm top mounted fans. This Corsair kit is designed to replace those two top-mounted fans. Because heat naturally rises, these kits work best if they are mounted on the underside of the top case cover. My Antec 300 case meets this criteria, however my Gigabyte 990 chipset motherboard places the AMD 8350, 8-core processor, too close to the inside top cover of the case. This should not be an issue on most Intel motherboard layouts. This resulted  in a lack of vertical clearance for the Corsair radiator unit with both fans mounted. The H100i v2 kit that I tested requires 3"" (75mm) of clearance between the processor and the top inside of the case. You will also need to be weary of protruding voltage regulator heat sinks, tall capacitors, DRAM cards and other large motherboard components, that are mounted near the top edge of the motherboard, that could interfere with the 240mm radiator/fan units supplied with these kits. I considered cutting out a portion the top perforated integral fan grills on my case to allow the water hoses and cold block to pass through and then mounting the fan/radiator unit externally for the test session. After some consideration I decided it was not worth the added expense of destroying a perfectly good case for the purpose of a single review. The final nail in the coffin on doing this review was the need to completely remove the motherboard to mount the cold plate/pump unit mounting brackets. Obviously it is easier to install these kits on a new build, before the motherboard/CPU are installed into the case. Would be nice if Corsair could come up with a retention lever mounting system that could work with the existing AMD motherboard CPU mounts, thus eliminating the need to remove the motherboard from the case. This would reduce the amount of time needed for retrofitting existing AMD systems.My experience with the Corsair H100i v2 cooling kit stresses the need to carefully measure the clearances needed to fit one of these kits into an existing system case, or to exercise care in selecting a new case to be compatible with the water cooling kit you wish to purchase. Alternatively in the worst case scenario have a Premier membership or similar account that allows you to return items that don't fit at little or no-charge.In conclusion based on my past experience of installing these Corsair water cooling kits for some of my clients, the single fan units are the most compatible, because they take up the least amount of internal case volume. If you are custom building a high-end gaming system, be sure to over-size your case height/depth to allow enough room for the planned water cooling system to mount. I have used a number of the Corsair kits over the years and have never had one come back due to water leakage, or any other defects. In my experience a single fan unit will work fine with processors that draw up to 125 Watts TDP. With a high-end, or older processor that exceeds 125 Watts TDP, I would recommend to use a dual-fan water cooler. If you are looking for a good low-maintenance, sealed-loop, water cooling kit I would not hesitate to recommend any of the current Corsair models. They are all well engineered to their individual price points and offer excellent value for your money.",26,26

Prior to installing the H100i in my primary desktop (i7 4770 with stock Intel cooler on Gigabyte GA-B85-HD3, 16GB DDR3 1600, 500GB Samsung 840 EVO SSD, in a Corsair 200r Carbide case) I measured CPU temps with Speedfan, a free utility that I've used for a few years.  At idle the temps ranged from 27C to 31C.  Then I ripped a 2GB video file three times with Handbrake and showed a peak temp of 87C.  (Handbrake is a good test of cooling prowess, it utilizes over 90% of CPU cycles during the ripping process.)  I installed th H100i (more on that later) and noticed idle temps dropped to a range of 20C to 26C --- nice start.  Then I ripped the same video file (again three times), and the temps peaked at only 49C. That is outstanding performance, especially since these tests were done at the stock, low fan speed setting.About the installation: I was surprised to find that this cooler was too big to fit in my Corsair case.  I never thought it would be an issue, the 200r is a big, roomy case with a grill and rubber grommets at the top, just waiting for a water cooler.  What I didn't factor in was the distance from the top of the case to any obstacles on the motherboard -- the radiator and fans extend down 2-1/4"" and overlapped the RAM and main power plug on my Gigabyte board.  I was determined to make it work, and after considerable head scratching and playing around I discovered that the vent holes in the top grid aligned with the mounting holes on the radiator.  I relocated the rear exhaust fan to the bottom of the case (something I was considering anyway) and moved the cooler about one inch toward the rear of the case, and up almost an inch.  I ended up with just enough room to clear the obstacles (about 1/8"" above the RAM), so close that I had to plug in the fan prior to mounting the cooler, but enough room to get the job done.   By the way, I suggest mounting the fans to the radiator first, then installing the  unit in one piece.Apart from that little challenge this was a very easy installation, the mounting process for the Intel CPU cooler/pump is much easier than it was a couple of years ago (this is my second Corsair water cooler, the first in this case).  I decided to use the factory thermal paste to give it a fair test and so far haven't experienced any problems.  Of course I thoroughly removed the old paste from the CPU.  Finally I installed the Cosair utility and played around with the different settings.  For now I'm sticking with the Low Fan Speed setting because the stock fans start to get noisy when set to the Balanced or Performance setting.  It's nice to know there's headroom for serious overclocking though.I think this is a very good closed-loop water cooling system.  Just be careful with case measurements if you're considering one of these, it can be a make or break issue if you don't have the same luck I did.  I initially debated knocking off an egg for the installation problems but decided that wouldn't be fair since I didn't do my research first.",1,1

After installing the H100i V2 I did bump up my OC another 300Mhz to 4.5Ghz.

Stock cooler at stock settings had me at 70C+ load (ouch), my aftermarket tower heatsink dropped me into the mid-60C range.  The H100i V2 took another whopping 20C off, dropping me into the low 40's while overclocked.  Simply amazing.I am consistently impressed at ease of installation (especially for Intel-based rigs), lack of space used, and of course the airflow orientation for the radiator -- Blowing heat straight out of the chassis!  AIO Watercoolers are really the best thing to happen to PC cooling in many, many years and I'm glad to see Corsair continue to innovate and push even better designs.Corsair still remains among the best PC hardware companies in the world.  I've dealt with their CS a few times now for various products and they always bend over backwards to make sure I'm happy.  I've been buying their products for over a decade and they've earned me as a loyal customer over the years.I'm really enjoying the new, flexible tubes as well.  MUCH easier to install than some of my past watercoolers.  And of course, Corsair Link is a great piece of software.  Monitors temperatures, fan speed, and allows for the LED colors to be changed easily via desktop application."," The stock fans are... adequate.  I would really advise replacing these with some higher pressure models if you value noise/efficiency.  If you're looking to stick with Corsair, the SP (Static Pressure) series is designed for radiators.  The AF series will also work well.Also I'm not sure if it was the screws provided or the mounting holes themselves but I had some issues getting screws to attach properly, which is an odd problem to have.  I was worried about stripping them but it seems to have worked out fine, but it's still something to be careful about.Some AMD sockets will REQUIRE the original backplate for mounting, so make sure you have that available if you intend to use the H100i V2 on AMD rigs."," This is a simple rebrand of the existing H100i with a few minor changes to the color strips and cables.

Anyone who has wrestled with FanSpeed's arcane interface will absolutely love this kit's software.The copper surface is soft-milled, and would be lappable if I weren't nervous about all the stainless screwheads.  I don't know of anyone who laps CPU/heatsink combos any more, but as soft as this copper is, there is no need.  The required clamping force of the mounting will actually alter the surface, and thermal paste will provide excellent heat dissipation."," I think these fans are noisier at any given speed than my H100.  I've noticed a lot of people recommend Noctua fans, but that raises the price about $38...  I just used the software to slow the fans down to a reasonable max, and the cooling seems to be pretty close to the same, maybe 2 deg difference max."," It's not a con, but this kit won't fit in many cases because of how the mainboard is installed.  I mounted this kit on the drive bay in a Fractal Define R4.  It would not top-mount unless I was willing to put the fans on the outside of the case.  The upside to where I mounted it is that I have 6 drives in the case, and it is nice to have air movement over these.I've used this particular system for 3 years doing video conversion, and it is really nice to see a max temp of 51C when the cpu is pegged at 4.5 for 2 hours straight.I know some people are afraid of having a liquid cooling solution because of the potential danger of leakage.  I've got 6 liquid coolant solutions in use, some dating back 3 years, and no leakage has ever occurred on any of these.For reference, I did not use the pre-applied thermal paste.  I have an industrial-size container of TiM TC grease 0098 and I use that on everything because it is good stuff.",None,None

No air cooling system would come close.  This is why you buy this system!  Even at full torture testing, the unit was able to keep temps below 32c.Design – 240mm Fans for fast and effective cooling.  SP120L PWM fan design – You are able to customize the speed of the high-static air.  You can even set the LED color.Setup – First rate software that is an industry best, you are able to customize and monitor your temperatures, plus pump and fan speeds.  You simply download the software from Corsair.com.  They were no issues.Physical Install – Fast and easy to say the least, with no issues with the Intel board.  Always have to be careful with Gigabyte boards, they tend to bend.  This is not a high-end system that is overly customizable, it is a better than average system that is ‘install and enjoy’.Everything Included – Even the thermal paste was included, but I removed it.  I didn’t use the cheap paste, as I went with Arlon silicone product Secure, which allows much better thermal performance.  Mounting kit, USB cable and mounting screws.  No wasted time finding the right stuff.Noise – Very minimal in comparison to air cooling fan units for CPU’s.  You will notice the sound, but it is not loud."," Case Size Needed- I planned for this with a larger than normal case.  The unit takes up a lot of room, and should be mounted inside.  Your old tight case will not work with the stiff hoses, as you will need room to mount it properly.

N82E16835181103,35-181-103,3/5/2016 12:12:45 PM,BRANDON R.,"Great product, good support",4," RGB LED Lighting, Easy Installation, Top cooling performance", Not as quiet as air," Corsair is a company that has been around for a while. Over the past decade they have diversified into several segments. Once they were only known for their RAM but now they have power supplies, cases, SSDs, gaming peripherals and finally AIO coolers like the H100i.Corsair packages their coolers in a very attractive box that is clearly labeled. Inside you’ll find that its protected with cardboard inserts, I don’t expect that you’ll get any bent fins with this packaging.The H100i comes in the typical configuration of a radiator, two hoses, and one block that combines the CPU plate and pump. Since the radiator is only 30mm thick you won’t get much air impedance thus I don’t think that using this in a push-pull configuration would not help performance, particularly considering the already high pressure fans that are supplied with the H100i. I’m coming from an air cooler (U12S) so I will be comparing performance to that. When you run the H100i in performance mode it will have a field day with whatever you throw at it. I have it hooked up to an Intel i5 2500K overclocked to 4.7GHz @ 1.3v and load temps were generally stable at 41C compared to 52C on air, average ambient temperature is ~ 23C during my tests. The high performance has a significant downside though as this will definitely be audible to you. I measured an average of 48.3 dB(A) and that is what I would consider above a tolerant noise level and the pump has a perceptible whining noise. This is compared to an average of 30.8 dB(A) coming from the air cooler. If you drop down to the “balanced” mode where the fans do not run at 100% then the noise does get better and the temperature only increased by 1C to 42C, however the noise went down to 39 dB(A) which is much better and a tolerable limit and the whining noise of the pump is barely audible now. So lets get to the meat of the discussion. Would I recommend this Corsair H100i v2? If your goal is the absolute best performance and you don’t mind hearing some noise coming from the CPU cooler than yes this is one of the best you can buy. But I think I’ll be sticking with my air cooler. Not only do you get something that is inaudible but it performs well and has less points of failure.",None,None
N82E16835181103,35-181-103,3/4/2016 5:53:52 AM,David K.,Excellent Closed Loop Cooler,4," My HTPC Specs: Z68 UD3P Mother Board i5 2500K 4.4 GHz 1.275 vCore8GB DDR3 2166 MHz GTX 580 3GB ZX1250 PSU This cooling loop does two things well. It does an excellent job of cooling and it's quiet. Previously I had a 212 Evo air cooler. I was pleased with its performance, especially given what I paid for it. I could run Prime95 on Small FTT setting for about an hour and never exceed 60C. I could run longer, but I was testing the cooler, not the overclock. With this cooler I was able to do the same, but after an hour the max temp I saw was 55C. The Sandy Bridge chips are renowned for running cool, so this result is not to be expected in every case. For those who don't know, Prime95 is a torture test for CPUs and RAM that stresses them to the limit for as long as the program is running. It's the most foolproof way to test your overclock and your coolers capability. I would be interested to see if the H100i V2 could keep my 4790K at 4.8 GHz below 90C. With my custom loop it doesn't exceed 80C, which is far above my comfort level already.None of these closed loop coolers could hope to compete with a properly built custom liquid cooling setup. However, they have advanced to the point where you can use them for reasonably heavy overclocking. When you start getting into high voltage and extreme overclocking, they can't keep up with the heat the CPUs generate. Which is where a high end custom loop would be the better choice. But for 99% of the people out there, one of these types of closed loop coolers will be sufficient cooling. Especially if all you're doing is gaming. The only time CPU usage stays maxed out for extended periods is when benchmarking or torture testing. Or if you do some kind of encoding that requires a lot of CPU processing power. I can imagine that this cooler, which is very well built for what it costs, could keep most CPUs cool enough for 24/7 use, especially if you're not overclocking. The fans that come with this cooler, at least according to the specs Corsair provides, appear to be better than the SP120 High Static Pressure High Performance Edition fans. They spin a bit faster and have better airflow and static pressure than the fans I mentioned. I have a set of those fans on my custom CPU loop and they're pretty good. At first glance, the ones in this kit don't appear quite as nice. They don't have any rubber dampers or any kind of color scheme. They don't vibrate or buzz so I guess they don't need those rubber dampers and I can't see the fans. So who cares if they're colored or not?They're rated for 70.69 CFM and 4.65 mm/H2O fan static pressure compared to the high end Corsair fan kit that has 62.74 CFM and 3.1 mm/H2O static pressure. A pretty significant boost in performance. They're also rated for a little higher noise level or decibels. But I don't notice any difference in the noise level between the two types and neither of them seems loud. If you keep them inside your case, it muffles them to the point where they're barely noticeable. You can customize your coolers settings using the Corsair Link software. You can monitor coolant temps, customize fan speeds or cooling profiles and change the LED color. Personally I would just set the fans to max speed and leave them. They're quiet enough that it's barely noticeable between lower speeds and max. Of course, if you have a lot of fans spinning maxed out all together, it can get noisy. In that case you may want to configure a profile for fan speeds. This kit comes with the hardware to fit to most modern mother boards. For Intel it supports all the X and Z series boards. Nothing earlier than that. For AMD it supports Everything from AM2 to FM2. Mounting this cooler to your CPU is really easy. No different than most after market air coolers. Although, with the type of screws it uses to clamp the water block to the CPU, it is really easy to damage your CPU socket by over tightening. With Intel sockets anyway. AMD sockets are much more user friendly. If you over tighten it, you risk bending contact pins in your socket. If you bend a pin, or several pins, you'll be in trouble. It is possible to bend pins back into place, but it is extremely difficult. I accidentally bent some pins on my x58 board when I over tightened my water block. I grabbed a flash light, a magnifying glass and a knife with a fine point. The knife probably isn't the best tool for this job, but it worked for me. All you can do is find the bent pins and try to very gently bend them back into place. My x58 Classified had 300% more gold in the CPU socket than a standard board, so the pins were far more susceptible to bending. A lot of people reported this problem in the forums online, so it's not just me."," The radiator for this loop is much smaller than I anticipated. The rads on my custom loops are at least 3 times thicker than this one is (65mm). The radiator shroud is deceiving. The radiator itself is only maybe 2/3 the thickness of the shroud. The dimensions for the radiator are supposed to be 276x125x30mm. Well the radiator shroud itself is about that size. However, the cooling fins, the section that has all the surface area where cooling takes place, are significantly thinner. Reducing the radiators cooling ability compared to one that is truly 30mm thick.I don't know exactly what kind of thermal paste this cooler comes with. So without being sure that it is a high end thermal paste, I wiped it clean and used the PK-3 paste that I prefer. I have been using it for a couple years now and its performance is outstanding. Especially when compared to cheap thermal paste that is usually included with most air coolers and water blocks. For those who don't know, the best way I've found to clean up thermal paste is to use rubbing alcohol and Q-tips. Simply dip the Q-tip in the rubbing alcohol, without getting it too saturated, and wipe clean the thermal paste. When it's cleaned up, take a clean Q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol and go over the area at least once more to ensure its completely clean.If you care enough about your cooling capacity to upgrade to liquid cooling, then you should know that each and every component in your loop is important. With the thermal paste being the most important of those things. If you're using a sub standard thermal paste, then your cooling capability will be severely limited. The same goes for all the other components, none of which you have the ability to change with a closed loop cooler. If your pump doesn't flow well enough to move your coolant at a sufficient rate or if your loop has too many obstructions, heat will remain trapped in your CPU. If your water blocks thermal efficiency is too low, it won't transfer enough heat to keep your CPU cool. If you don't have a coolant reservoir, your coolant will heat up more quickly than a loop with ample coolant reserves. If your radiator is too small for the amount of heat your CPU generates, it won't be able to dissipate heat quickly enough to keep your CPU cool. The smaller your tubing, the less your coolant flow rate will be. You do have some degree of control over some of those things with closed loop coolers. You can choose which model you want. With the higher end models, like this one, being far more efficient than the loops equipped with a single 120mm radiator. The tubing is pretty rigid. There is some flexibility. The tubing does need to be rigid to a degree to prevent kinking. However, for a system where you can't modify anything, I expected the tubing to be a little easier to work with.Mounting one of these closed loop coolers can be problematic. Even more so than a custom loop, because you can't modify the length of your tubing. Without being able to modify the tubing, you're forced to mount it within a certain radius of your CPU and it must be inside your case. Unless you leave the side cover off or you modify your case in some way.With the vast majority of computer cases, there isn't anywhere to mount a radiator this big. A single 120mm or 140mm can easily be mounted in any case fan bay. But I haven't seen many cases designed to mount 240mm or larger radiators internally. There are some that are and many cases have ports for tubing. But you can't use them with a closed loop cooler. So unless you bought a case with that in mind you'll be forced to find some custom way of mounting it. Case modding is one of my favorite things about building PCs. The easiest way to mount one of these is by using zip ties. Just anchor your zip tie around something in your case and secure it to one of the bolts you used to mount the 120mm fans to your radiator. That's what I did. It doesn't really matter what position your radiator is mounted in, whether it's horizontal or vertical. But to be safe you should try to keep the radiator above the pump, which is mounted to the water block. So that gravity will feed coolant to your pump and prevent it from pumping air. Which could burn it up. These closed loop systems are filled so that there is a little bit of air in them. But, after a couple years, some of that liquid could evaporate, leaving air in you system. Letting gravity do some of the work for you should help to extend the life of your pump and might improve overall flow rate as well. You might think I'm crazy, but from personal experience I know that a sealed system will need coolant added at some point. Even if there aren't any leaks or vents for air to get in."," This kit comes with thermal paste pre-applied. Which can save time and make the job much easier if you don't plan to use your own. Since the kit doesn't come with a tube of thermal paste, if you have to reapply the paste then you'll end up having to buy some separately. When you mount your water block, if you want to apply your own thermal paste, like I did, then use whatever method you prefer. I prefer to spread a thin, even layer over the surface of the entire CPU. If you have to reinstall your cooler for whatever reason you should always reapply your thermal paste. Once a cooler has been mounted and taken off, it can introduce air bubbles into your thermal paste. Which will reduce its thermal efficiency in some spots. This cooler does require a backplate for Intel CPUs, so you'll have to pull out your mother board for installation. When you tighten your water block, gently set your water block on top of your CPU. Then while holding it in place, tighten each of the screws in an X pattern, to the point where the water block is secure, but not tight. Going from top left to bottom right then from top right to bottom left and so on. Until you start to feel tension while turning the screws. At that point tighten each screw 1/4 turn at a time in an X pattern until each screw is tightened to the point that you're starting to feel resistance. Then tighten each screw a bit at a time until they're all equally tight. Just go by feeling, if you have to force it or put a lot of torque into the screw driver, then it's already tight enough. This cooler has nicely braided lines that appear much nicer than the plain black hosing you normally get with one of these closed loop coolers. The contact point on the water block is also nicely polished and smooth. I recently came across an air cooler that had a really nasty uneven finish, which has given me a greater appreciation for coolers that have a properly finished surface. You can kind of hear the pump running while the system is on. It's louder on boot, but that's normal. When they fill these systems, they leave a little bit of air in the loop, so there will be room for expansion once the coolant heats up. So take my advice on mounting the radiator and keep it above the water block/pump to avoid burning up your pump. Many of these types of pumps are lubricated by whatever type of liquid they're pumping. So if they end up pumping nothing but air for too long they can overheat quickly and burn up the motor that moves the pump. Which is why you shouldn't allow your car to run out of gas entirely or run it on an empty tank all the time. It could burn up your fuel pump. The value of this cooler is pretty good. I mean, a cheap air cooler like the one I had before this system did a pretty good job for my mildly overclocked, already cool running i5 2500K. This cooler did a far superior job, but as I have found, if you want superior cooling, it's not going to come cheap. The cost will rise exponentially once you surpass standard air coolers. At the point I'm at with my custom loops, each upgrade usually costs around a hundred bucks and usually only drops my temps 2C at a time. You can only have so much air flow before you have to sacrifice quiet for performance. Larger radiators means more fans and once you start upgrading pumps you'll hit a wall quickly. You can run multiple pumps, but that is where it starts getting tricky. So for the cooling performance you get with this system, the price is pretty adequate. I've built a number of custom cooling loops for all types of components over the past decade. With varying degrees of success. Whenever you build a custom loop you always take the risk that it might leak and therefore damage something. I have had two incidents where leaks have occurred with my own custom loops. In one case it fried a graphics card, which fortunately was covered under warranty and replaced. The second time I ended up with a big pink stain on my carpet from the red coolant, but no damage to components. Neither occurrence was my fault. Both events were due to wear over time. Which is why it's important to inspect your liquid cooling loop occasionally.Custom loops are also very expensive.  I've got around $1000 into my cooling system on my gaming rig.So custom loops aren't for everyone. If closed loop systems like this one had been around when I bought my CPU loop gear, I might have passed that up for something like this one. The simplicity of just installing it already assembled is appealing. Also, they're low maintenance. You can't change the coolant or any other components, so there's really nothing to work on. If your system needs to be torn down for some reason, pulling out the entire loop all in one piece is a cake walk compared to draining and disassembling a custom loop.",1,2

Just required another bracket- Once fully configured properly you can make the setup very quiet and still perform well- Good packaging- Good warranty", - Included fans can be noisy if the system isn't properly configured," Overall my experience with Corsairs AIO Water Cooling was suburb. I have an H100i (v1) that I have been using so it was good to test against both to see what the overall differences were.  Performance wise, I would say they were very similar. There are some things I liked about the H100 vs the H100 v2 but overall if I had to choose between the two I'd probably pick this one. The H100 has a motherboard header that just shows fan speeds, etc but doesn't actually power any of the setup. That's all done via a separate SATA connection. On the one hand I prefer this setup because it let's you run the pump at full power while keeping the fans low. As for the H100i v2 because power is delivered via the fan header on the motherboard, you are unable to have the pump run at full speed all the time. Maybe this isn't desirable generally but it was for me. You also can only run two fans off of the H100i v2 while the H100i allows for four. Maybe this is the reason for the extra SATA connection. On the plus side, not haven't to utilize a SATA power connection does free up a SATA connection and makes the unit feel more like an all in one solution. As for cooling performance I tested with a Core i7 4970K processor overclocked to 4.5 GHz. Temps always stayed below 75C at maximum load and the fans running on AUTO. Both units performed similarly. I then moved to a socket 2011v3 setup with a Core i7 5930k overclocked to 4.0 GHz. Again both performed well but because of the extra heat generated by the bigger processor I was looking at max load around 80-83C with fans on quiet mode. A little warm, but still acceptable for that kind of overclock. On standard mode that went down to 70 and max fans that dropped down to 55C. It really depends on how much noise you want to endure. For me, I just wanted quiet. All in all this AIO cooler is my number one go to cooler for most situations. I know there are plenty of air coolers that do a pretty good job but if you want extreme performance at a good price then I highly recommend this product. One final thing to note, depending on your motherboard you will find it easier or harder to adjust fan controls to make this as quiet as possible. On my Z97 ASROCK board I had a very easy time setting what I wanted in the bios. On the Asus X99 board, it was a bit more tricky. I ended up utilizing both the ASUS FanXpert software and the Corsair Link software to maximize fan noise vs performance. It took a little bit of tweaking but in the end it worked out great.

N82E16835181103,35-181-103,3/2/2016 6:59:27 AM,Daniel C.,"Better quality control than older models, awesome performance as expected",4," Historically I've stuck with air coolers like the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO and Zalman CNPS coolers, simply because I don't like dealing with liquid coolers. Closed loop liquid coolers like Corsair's have been impressive since they first hit the scene, but they had some quality control issues in earlier models. Luckily, the H100i V2 is much better than previous models I've tested, and it performs well enough and quiet enough for me to throw in my main rig. Unlike older models where I've had issues, the fins were straight, clean and there weren't any obvious scuffs from the manufacturing process. Testing even on an older model i7-980X I was able to get some pretty good idle temperatures around 22c and full load around 38c, yet the noise of the pump was quiet and the fans didn't have to spin up too loudly to keep up.The tubing on this model is much nicer and has a softer feel than I'm used to for closed loop systems like this. The tubes are wrapped in a fine webbing that's smooth to the touch and very flexible, unlike the hard rubberized plastic that's commonly used. I had no trouble twisting this around while fitting it in my Corsair 750D (though I wouldn't do it excessively).Although it's not limited to just this product, having Corsair Link available through the USB interface is always a huge plus. The added fan speed control and insight into temperature graphs is always useful when trying to fine tune a cooler like this for better cooling with minimum sound. You're able to also control the RGB LED on the top of the CPU cooler mount through this software, including having it change color based on the temperature of your CPU."," While quality control is better than previous Corsair models, I still noticed a few minor issues with the model I received. There was a fair amount of what appeared to be the coolant inside the closed loop around the fittings. Fearing a leak, I cleared the area and tested it before installing to make sure there wasn't any damage, but luckily it just looked like it wasn't cleaned before leaving manufacturing. I also noticed the bottom of the CPU cooler had a lot of water spots, and it looked incredibly dirty. Neither of these items are signs of defects, but not having to scrub down the heat sink and fittings would have been nice.It's also worth noting that the fans that are included with this unit are some of the lowest end fans that Corsair makes and lack any sort of rubberized fittings like the older models included. I would highly suggest replacing them with something like Corsair AF120 fans instead to reduce noise and increase performance."," Overall this is a pretty good product. It lacks modular connectors like custom loops or other models with quick disconnects, however the fully enclosed system Corsair provides works quite well. Aside from the few gripes I had with QC and grime on my unit when it arrived, I've been fully happy with this unit so far and have been using it on my daily workstation.",None,None
N82E16835181103,35-181-103,3/1/2016 11:31:47 PM,Anonymous,Great performance and great looks,5," Easily the best cooler I've ever had in my desktop. Brings temperatures very close to ambient and there’s only a few degrees difference under load (single digits). Even with an i5 4690K that is decently overclocked and moderately over-volted, everything stays cool. (By the way, if you are up for it, I recommend de-lidding. Otherwise you’ll be limited by the processor rather than the cooler and no matter how good of a cooler you have you’ll stay at the same temperature). Fans are also very nice- they are quiet at low speeds and at high speeds are not too loud but still put out a significant amount of air.Aside from performance, the quality of everything is also great. It doesn’t look like a generic all in one liquid cooler and that’s what makes this worth it- a lot of coolers are made by the same company and all end up being more or less the same but Corsair has clearly put their own engineering into this unit. The block for example has built in controllable LEDs (coolest thing is that it will change colors based on temperature, looks fantastic), and a USB port that you can use to connect it to your motherboard USB header to control it from software. What also sets it apart is the attention to detail- the radiator for instance has some nice trim and the rubber tubing is braided. Small stuff like that really makes a difference in a windowed case. Installation is not too bad, although you do have to remove your motherboard if it’s already installed to put a backplate in. However once you do that the mounting mechanism is extremely secure and provides a very decent amount of pressure (which is important for good heat transfer)."," None really. Make sure you measure out your case and have space for it before you buy of course, this is a large 2 radiator cooler and if you don’t have enough clearance, you’ll have to improvise/mod stuff to get it in. I personally installed it on an Intel LGA 1150 board and the only annoying part was removing the motherboard. Others have mentioned that AMD boards requires disassembling the stock mounting system and re-using some parts which is a bit strange so make sure you pay attention to the instructions."," Wish there was some way to integrate my lighted case fans with the LED controller in this.

I wish Corsair would sell a FAN with the same specs but less noisy.Installation, Installation, Installation...1. the Installation procedure could be a lot faster/simpler = easier if they would reuse the back-plate support that comes with AMD mobo.  Just include some screws that fit the 'standard' and throw in an extra 'standard' back plate in case the old one is not so standard.2. These screws that they include need some sort of plastic base that needs to be assembled before you can use the screws = WASTE OF TIME... at least the AMD do not need this... if I am not mistaken they are made that way for the 1155, 1150 and 2011 intel sockets... well the AMD AM3 plate could have come with them already built into the top bracket plate.  Assembling these little things takes unnecessary time.3. the FAN cable 'could' be a little longer... in my case, where the fan had to go from the top outside to the inside, had this cable been 2"" longer, I wouldn't had have to do some serious workarounds to get this thing to work."," The H90 was used on a build for medium graphics demand.

N82E16835181036,35-181-036,2/18/2014 10:43:19 PM,Anonymous,excellent,5," I think this is the best value in the corsair series.  Temps are very similar to H100i and H110, but you only have one 140mm fan.  Much easier to fit and mount in almost all cases, and with good push pull configurations with the 140mm fans the performance is great.  i have been using the corsair af 140mm purple and blue led fans which are also super quiet and the entire system is dead silent while being very easy on the eyes with a windowed case.  be careful when you go with 120mm fans and use the stock fans, when you are under load they get very loud.  everyone is different, but i hate the noise.  140mm fans result in excellent cooling which is dead silent - just what i want in a cooling solution."," stock fans are loud, but this is consistent with most water cooling systems.  sucks spending another 30 bucks in good quiet fans, but it's totally worth it when you consider how much easier it is to fit this in most cases vs a h110."," i strongly recommend this if you are using a mid tower case.  it's very similar in performance to a h100i, but the h100i is incredibly loud with stock fans.  i always run in push pull because you do get better performance if you use quality fans.  it's a long term investment to protect your cpu, so a few more bucks to protect a $200-$500 overclocked processor is totally worth it.  if you go with a full tower and want an extreme overclock id definitely recommend the h110 in push pull with good quality fans.  the fractal midi xl is a great option for that kind of setup.  the coolermaster haf is another good case that will fit the h110, but i hate how the dust builds up in the mesh and you just don't have that issue with the fractal xl.  i really didn't explain why i preferred this over the lower versions like the h50-75, but the main reason is that this is just slightly more expensive, but with the 140mm fans and larger radiator its going to be so much quieter and provider better cooling.  right now the price difference in negligible.  obviously that can change, but if they are even remotely close in price there are way too many advantages to go with the h90.",None,None

You must use screws that are about 1.25"" long and are threaded to screw into the radiator, I don't have details or recommendations about which to buy- Does not include a fan-header splitter for push-pull (not a big deal, but a consideration)- The instruction manual included with my H90 did not mention the LGA1150 socket, so I downloaded an updated manual off corsair's website - this is necessary to know how to setup the backplate and cold-plate - A little tricky to install, plan it out first and read instructions carefully!- Not compatible with Corsair Link software as far as I know- Short tubes somewhat restrict placement of radiator (can't be put in the front of the case, top and back seem fine)- Radiator is a little bulky (can you call this a con? It's as small as they could've possibly made it)"," The H60: I had 2 huge problems with the H60 cooler that look like they've been SOLVED by the H90. Though the H60 worked great for months and was very quiet, eventually it developed a slow leak. I noticed the leak when I replaced my case about a week ago--an oily liquid was being released from where the tube hooked into the radiator. The second problem was the extremely soft metal used in the radiator, basically I stripped the screw hole making it near impossible to secure (not that it ended up being an issues, as I tossed the thing in the garbage after I noticed the leak).The H90 says it offers ""2nd generation tubing,"" by this I almost think they're saying ""yeah, we know the H60 had leaking problems, but this one fixes that."" In any case, the tubing is clearly superior. It is a wider diameter, more flexible, more forgiving, and appears to be secured better to both the radiator and the cooling block. I seriously doubt I will have any problems with this.The H90 also has very solid construction of the radiator. The metal is markedly harder than that of the H60 and I expect I will not have the problems with screw-stripping I did with the H60.Couple of things to note: from what I've read, you want the pump hooked up to a non-speed controlled fan header or make sure the fan header is set to maximum RPM (you want the full 12 volts), CPU_OPT on ASUS motherboards appears to to the trick. Don't worry, you wont hear the pump.  The pump has a hal sensor so it's going to show an RPM in the thousands. You're also going to hear it make some weird rattling-type noise when it starts. I'm not sure if that's normal but it never makes it again :)I'm using a Haswell I7 4770K and have not overclocked. I keep the fan at full RPM because I can't hear it (YMMV, depending on your case). With the H90 it idles at around 21C and 33-36 when running BF4. This is more than adequate for me as my goal is to extend the life of my processor as long as possible and have peace and quiet.",2,4

Oh boy, is it a WORLD of difference between the Corsair H90 and the stock AMD heatsink+fan! Both in terms of heat dissipation and noise levels.Temperatures @ idle (stock clock speeds) are consistently in the 6-15°C range. Temps under 100% load (again, stock clock speeds, using Prime95 running for ~15minutes) never got above 41°C. Combine that absolutely fantastic cooling performance with the fact that the 140mm radiator fan produces next to no noise, and you have a product that I have no problem recommending to anyone who is looking to replace that darn stock AMD cooler that sounds like a spaceship taking off when the CPU comes under heavy load.I do suggest that you search for product reviews, installation guides, and how-to demonstrations on Youtube if you are new to closed-loop CPU water-coolers. The documentation, particularly for the AMD sockets, is downright terrible. It really doesn't go further than a sentence or 2 when explaining the step-by-step diagrams in the ""Quick Start Guide"" (there is no real manual, just a rather small booklet, and if the unit didn't perform as well as it does then I would have taken off 1 egg for this in the product rating).This unit, along with most of the other closed-loop CPU coolers in Corsair's Hydro series is OEM'd by ASETEK, which is the same OEM that other brands use as well. So if you have experience with the NZXT Kraken (among others) the mounting hardware will be very familiar to you. All in all, the installation procedure was not that difficult, but would be made MUCH simpler with some decent documentation (step it up, Corsair). This was my first experience with a closed-loop all-in-one CPU cooler (or any water cooling, for that matter), and It took me about an hour to remove the stock cooler and install the H90, and I couldn't be happier with the results.PROTIP:Plug the pump into the CPU_FAN header on your motherboard, and configure that header, in the BIOS, to use 100% of the 12v power. This is easily done on most modern motherboards that have UEFI. For instance, on my ASUS motherboard it is the ""Turbo"" fan profile. Alternatively, you could use a 3pin-to-Molex adapter and plug the pump directly into your power supply.

N82E16835181036,35-181-036,5/19/2013 11:13:03 AM,Karen V.,Consider a different product,1, -Large 140mm fan with the ability to configure a push/pull  effect on both sides of the radiator.-Large radiator surface area-Quiet, -Difficult to install correctly.-Poorly designed-Has less features than the lower priced H 80i-pre-installed thermal paste is garbage," The plastic bracket that secures the pump to the MB is of low quality and poor design.  The pump secures to the MB by way of four screws that tighten into four nuts inside the mounting bracket.  The bracket is designed to fit different sockets, so there's three different countersunk holes in each of the four corners - you pick the one that matches your socket and put the small nuts into the corresponding countersunk holes in each of the four corners.  The nuts are supposed to be secured by the plastic bracket, but once you tighten the pump screws down, the nuts strip out the plastic and begin free-spinning, thus you cannot tighten or loosen the pump screws without introducing another tool or tools to try and hold the nuts still.  This is a significant problem if you want to try to take the pump off for troubleshooting purposes.If you do get this model, get rid of the pre-installed thermal paste and apply a different kind.  The paste is pretty useless IMO.Going from a 120mm fan on the H 80i to a 140mm config on the H 90i was a good idea, but why not set it up as a push/pull?  The H 90i comes with 1 fan, so if you want a push/pull, you have to provide the second fan.  The pump housing does not light up like the H 80i (which can be configured to shine red once the CPU gets to a certain temp - nice feature the H 90i doesn't have).  There's no software to configure/control the H 90i (the H 80i has this) and the H 80i is cheaper.  In my opinion, you're much better off going with the H 80i over  the H 90i.  However, RMAing through Corsair is very easy.  After being outside the 30 day NewEgg RMA, Corsair did an express RMA for me without any issues and I got an H 80i for the H 90i in about two days.",5,10

The Single 140mm Radiator performs as good as a 240mm AIO setup. (I have personally tested it against a H100i, Tt Water 2.0 Extreme & Noctua NH-D14).The CPU mount is very easy to mount and is very sturdy. I like it much better than the H110i mount.If your case has mounts for dual 140mm fans then the H90 will most likely fit with the Fan on the top of the Radiator and you will still be able to use another 140mm fan next the H90's fan.You cannot mount the radiator directly to the case without interfering with the adjacent fan mount.The fan and pump wiring on the H90 is very basic (which i like). There is no USB connection or proprietary software to use. They connect to and are controlled by the motherboard controls.The pump uses a 3 pin fan header and reports its speed (1520rpm) via the 3rd wire. The fan header should be set at 100%.The FAN is a 4 pin PWM and is reasonably quiet at typical speeds but is loud at full rpm. Fortunately the fan/radiator combo is very effective and doesn't need to be running at full speed to keep the temps down even at full load. Mounting the fan in ""Pull"" sucking air through the radiator and exhausting out the case is quieter due to less wind rush noise at the expense of about 1c degrees in temp.The pump on the H90 is dead silent.Overall i would recommend the H90.",5,5

N82E16835181036,35-181-036,4/16/2013 2:18:14 PM,Michael S.,Worth it,4," Did what it said on the box for me once I got it installed. It has lowered my running temps by an average of twenty degrees, and that is Celsius mind you so we are talking a major improvement. I also switched from a 3.7ghz zambezi 8 core to a much higher 4.2 vishera 8 core, so it's even more impressive."," The ring arrangement to secure the cooler to the chip was baffling and didn't make much sense over a standard one piece arrangement. The radiator is so long that I wouldn't have been able to run it and the second 140 top fans together on my NZXT Hades case had I been uncomfortable with modifying it, and some users have had to sacrifice two ram slots for the hoses to fit properly.Lastly, the thermal compound that came stock was so thick, with no way to warm it since it was attached to the block already, that it twisted my original cpu out of socket, ruining it and bending several pins. I didn't remove any eggs for this as I should have watched it closer, but to be safe I would scrap the stock paste on receipt and apply something like prolimatech."," Though I am upset about the stock paste ruining my original cpu when I was seating the block, the cooler itself works well, and the new chip was a massive upgrade for the price of the original. If you are an avid builder like I am, and are used to gently twisting the block back and forth to squeeze out any air bubbles and spread the paste as you seat it, I advise you not try it with the stock paste. I really can't stress that enough.",2,2

N82E16835181036,35-181-036,4/9/2013 4:09:05 PM,Rauel C.,"Nice, but make sure you have a compatible case",4," I found this to be a very quiet unit that has proven to be very effective in getting extra performance from my machines.It gave me some peace of mind when I ran it on my Phenom II 965 @ 4.0Ghz. Previously I had a Corsair A50 on it(itself a very nice Traditional Air Cooler) and the max I could eek out was 3.8Ghz, before the screen would corrupt and the system restart. However, with the H90 I got another 200Mhz out of this old chip and actually stay at about a max of 48c, which is much better than 3.8Ghz with a max temp of 55c.  Tested it on other chips(1090t@4.0Ghz, 2600k@5.0Ghz) and this cooler performed exceptionally. I have no bad things to say about the cooling performance of the H90. On my Q6600 I have an old Corsair H50, and remember having some issues with setting it up. This H90, while you still have to ""assemble"" it, is much easier to install(the CPU block that is) as the backplate is easy to put in place especially with the stickies Corsair provides.It also looks pretty awesome in the case, in it's own subdued ""quiet power"" way."," It would be great if Corsair provided two of every small item. It would make it less terrifying if you lose a part. Also you have to keep in mind, this is a 140mm radiator that comes with a 140mm fan, so from the top it eat about 2"" into the case. So make sure that not only your case, but also that your motherboard is compatible with it. Some of my boards had heatsinks on the MOFSETS which wouldn't allow this coolers installation. I had to do some finagling to get it to fit in one of my cases.I'm unsure if this cools better than my H50( in push/pull config) on my Q6600,  but it appears to, and considering that the H50(and other 120mm AiO Corsair Watercoolers) provides similar cooling in a much more universally compatible size, and cheaper I'd likely recommend those prior to this, unless you have a case that you KNOW you won't have a problem installing this in."," While I really like this watercooler, I was really dismayed by the size of it. I own a variety of cases and found only one that would mount it. I've searched for better compatible cases, but most would have you mound the radiator on the top of the case as opposed to the rear, which is my preferred location for it. That said, with a fully compatible case and motherboard I could see this be an excellent cooler. It's quiet, performs exceptionally well, and once I got it in a case, it looked pretty epic.",2,2

Simple mounting with 140mm radiator, See other thoughts, I replaced an H55 with this at the same time that I replaced my 3570k with a 3770k. I never went over 65c with the H55 on my 3570k running full burn tests. With this and my 3770k @ 4.4ghz I see temps easily over 85c. The only difference is I can come up with is that i left the stock TIM on the H55 and am using some old and dated AS Ceramique with this one. I have even reseated the waterblock twice.

N82E16835181036,35-181-036,3/6/2013 10:47:32 PM,Nathan R.,Simple and Effective and a Must,5," Here are the positive aspects of the H90:It’s quiet. The pump is silent to my ears. The fan is PWM and speeds can be regulated. When using a silent fan profile. I cannot hear the fan.It’s simple. It mounts at two points. It’s powered from 2 wires.It’s compatible. It offers compatibility with all the current AMD and Intel platforms. Sockets 1155/1156, 1366, 2011, AM3+ are all supported.It’s clean. I replaced a Swiftech H2O-220 Edge that used black swivel compression fittings and white tubing. While the H90 is not as fancy in appearance, its smaller footprint and unobtrusiveness give a clean look with an open space feel.It performs. With a fan profile that allows the fan to run at 100%, the H90 cooled better than my larger and more expensive cooler. At 140mm it competes directly with other 2x120mm radiators, and even bests Corsair’s own H100.It has a 5 year warranty.It has a 140mm PWM fan. This might not seem like much, but after looking online for another, I didn’t find much. They exist, but you don’t have too many options. And those that do are not giving specifications that rival those listed for this fan.It’s maintenance free. Not that this sealed cooler carries this trait uniquely, but it’s worth noting the comparison when also considering a custom liquid cooling system."," I didn’t find a lot to complain about the H90. But there are a few points.The first thing to note is that the 140mm radiator size makes for a great and effective cooling surface, it does pose a problem for a lot of people who simply don’t have a spot to mount a 140mm fan and radiator. 120mm fans have been the standard large case fan for quite some time now and their usage is found to be much more prevalent in a far larger amount of cases. So to even use this cooler, you’re going to need the right case with the right mountings.Another aspect of this cooler is that it seems to be somewhat a reversion in terms of features. The H80 and H100 featured integrated fan controllers. The H80i and H100i seemed like refreshers to the previous products, but not without adding Corsair’s Link technology to further add to the features. Then the H90 and H110 arrive and one would most likely just assume that this too would have integrated fan control and Link. But neither are found on this cooler. Not everyone is going to think this is a fault of the product and in fact some will see the benefit in these being removed. But for those who did assume and found out otherwise, there might be some disappointment associated with the purchase.I’d also like to mention the somewhat more complicated process of mounting the cooler. This was my first experience with using the ring type mounting bracket used in the Asetek style coolers. And while it wasn’t daunting in any way, I’ve definitely used simpler designs that seemed to work just as effectively. Assembling the brackets involved some fairly small parts that required some finer motor skills.Lastly, I think the cooler is slightly overpriced. If it came in at $90 instead of $100 I’d recognize the value of this cooler a little bit better. I say this because at one point Corsair mostly stood alone with these coolers. But there are other reputable manufacturers that are now selling basically the same coolers. Corsair’s brand name speaks volumes, but I don’t feel it should be the only distinguishing factor that makes you select their cooler over the competition. A more competitive price would insure Corsair’s dominant positionThat being said, I wanted there to be enough cons with cooler to bring it down to 4 stars. I don’t like overzealously representing anything too favorably. But the pros too greatly outweigh the cons here making for a great product which I cannot in good conscious take away any stars."," I used to use custom loops. And while performance was great, they came with their own pitfalls. I changed my hardware frequently, and I can’t say I appreciated the process of dealing with a custom loop.  They also added maintenance and costs that didn’t present much value. Then came the sealed liquid coolers from Corsair. I wasn’t impressed. They couldn’t match the performance of a custom loop. But the simplicity and ease of installation spoke to me. Eventually I started using a Swiftech H2O-220 Edge, where the pump, radiator and reservoir were all-in-one, but the loop remained custom.  I found myself using it more like a sealed system though.I first experienced a Corsair cooler was when I needed to do maintenance on my Swiftech. I use the H100 as a temporary cooler. After a while, I was asking myself why I had spent 2 ½ times the amount on the Swiftech when I could have just used the H100 for the same performance. I decided to reinstall the Swiftech because I had just spent a lot on new compression fittings and white tubing.Fast forward to receiving the H90. I was convinced that its thin 140mm radiator and tiny tubing would be no match for my thick 120x2 radiator using ½ in. tubing. I was wrong. The H90 handedly beat the more expensive system. Not only that, it’s quieter. It’s simpler to install. It takes up less space in my case. The pump on my Swiftech would whine while the H90’s is silent.I’ve decided to keep using the H90 and retire the Swiftech.Having used the H100, the H90 does make some reductions. The H100 could regulate the fan speeds itself. For the H90, the fan needs to be attached to a PWM fan header. It lowers the production cost for Corsair. But they didn’t pass those savings on to the consumer. Another confusing point is the recently release H100i and H80i which provides added features over the H100 and H80 like Corsair’s Link. Yet Link is nowhere to be found on the H90 or H110. And while these changes or omissions might seem somewhat detrimental, I think its fine. Without Link or fan control, it’s so much simpler to install. There is one wire for the fan, and one wire for pump. That’s it. No added clutter.Assuming it costs less to make, I do feel like this item might be slightly overpriced at $100. Plus with some serious competition arriving in the form of the new H220, cost saving incentives from Corsair need to be more evident.I benchmark tested this cooler against my prior Swiftech cooler using a 3770K @ 4.5GHz. These are the results:H20-220Idle: 26°CLoad: 80°CH90 (with Silent Fan Profile)Idle: 29°CLoad: 84°CH90 (with Normal Fan Profile) Idle: 29°CLoad: 77°C",33,35

N82E16835181036,35-181-036,3/2/2013 6:26:32 PM,Robert P.,Finally Able to Hit 5GHz,5," I have a large tower heatsink that has two 120mm fans in a push-pull configuration cooling my i7-2700k CPU.  It uses five direct touch heatpipes.  I’ve always considered it to be a quality heatsink.  Currently, it is listed as #5 on the top 10 list of a popular website that reviews heatsinks.That being said, I’ve never been able to hit that magical 5GHz barrier with my CPU.  Sure, I can boot into the OS, but it’s never been stable under stress testing.  So naturally, I did a side-by-side comparison of my current tower heatsink and the Corsair Hydro H90 with the goal of reaching a stable 5GHz.  I was surprised to not only hit 5GHz with the H90, but also how big the delta was from my current tower heat sink.  At higher clocks, I was seeing temperatures 15 degrees below my tower air cooler.  See below for more details.I did not experience any leaks in the closed loop system and found the installation was easy enough, but it did require reading the instructions carefully.  The pump of the H90 is completely inaudible unless I put my ear about 4 inches away.  Even then it was barely noticeable.  And finally, the 140mm fan is very quiet, though still audible, and is PWM capable to allow automatic motherboard control."," Removal of the H90 is as straightforward as the installation, however removal of the thumb screws from the bracket is a bit troublesome because they lock onto the bracket when you push them through for installation.  In order to remove them, you need to gently bend back three plastic clamps to pop it back out.  It would be VERY easy to break these clamps if you give a little bit too much leverage.  It seems like Corsair doesn’t think anyone will reuse this heatsink on a different socket after the initial installation with this minor shortcoming.", Here are my stress test results comparing my current tower heatsink and the H90.  Below I’ve listed the maximum temperature of the hottest core as reported by RealTemp while running Linpack in Intel Burn Test to torture my i7-2700k.  I used Arctic Cooling MX-4 as the thermal paste for both original tower HSF and the Corsair Hydro H90 to keep things equal.

N82E16835146042,35-146-042,9/26/2015 5:39:11 PM,Matt A.,It didn't leak!,5," For starters, as most people worry about with liquid coolers, I didn't obtain a leaker! Now then, lets get started. This is a great CPU cooler, my i7-6700k is keeping nice and chilly with the 1.4voltage running through it (poorly binned cpu so I am only obtaining 4.5ghz on that) at 27c idle, with the max temps under 100% stress with RealBench hitting 65c. At 1.4 volts, that's a winner to me. Especially when I have it on silent mode in the CAM software. Which is my next topic of discussion, the CAM software gets a lot of knocks, but personally I don't see what can be hated on here, it's good at displaying information, accurately at that. My temps fall in line with AiSuite for the CPU and Precision X software for the GPU.There is also easy customization within the CAM software that will help you utilize it however you'd like."," I have no cons, it runs silent operation, and cools my CPU to temps that I consider superb."," The RGB lighting was a great effect as well, I'm glad NZXT took that route.

It has to be totally silent in my house, without the heat or AC running, in order to hear it at all in my H440, and it's sitting less than a foot away from me. Even set to silent in CAM, it keeps my FX-8350 on Turbo below 30C while gaming, usually in the 24-27 range. Currently sitting at a ridiculous 15C while I'm typing this review. Part of that is how cool the room it sits in is kept, sure, but this is a fantastic cooler worth every penny.Throw in the ability to change the LED color on the pump to anything you want, the 6 year warranty, and NZXT's phenomenal customer service, and this is money well spent.Also, Newegg's shipping. They seem to have built a warehouse in Indianapolis (I live in Fort Wayne) in the last few years, and even picking the free 5-8 day shipping is essentially next-day shipping for free. Could not be happier about this."," Doesn't make my coffee in the morning?Really, the only con I've found is the instructions provided are terrible. You're much further ahead to go to NZXT's site and look at what they have posted there. Those are much more clear and easy to understand, and would make installation trivial for even someone that had never opened a computer case before. Nothing work docking an egg over."," This was a bit of a tight fit to get into my H440, but I was removing an old air cooler and replacing it with this, so keep in mind the radiator is a bit large and can be difficult to get in place depending on your setup.",3,3

These work well, although they are only 3 pin fans, as opposed to the 4 pin fans included, and as I said I get a bit of a hum from them I didn't expect.  Still quieter than my old PC that was all fan cooled.Instructions are a little confusing in that they are a few pictures on a small folded piece of paper included in the box.  These instructions tell you to connect all cables (except the water pump connection) to the x61 SATA power, where as an online video I found published by NZXT instructs you to plug everything into the motherboard.The Asus Z170 Deluxe has a water pump connection on the motherboard.  This delivers more reliable voltage to the pump than plugging it into a fan header, which many users have had issues and complained about online.  I use Fan Xpert 3 in the Asus AI Suite to control all the fans and water pump and it works great.  However, if you want CAM to control everything, then you need to use the SATA power connection on the x61 for all of the fans.  The pump still needs to connect to a fan header or pump header on the motherboard.",3,3

I didn't care about overclocking but wanted good system stability (never running hot) and for it to be as quiet as it possibly could be.  This is a great solution as it cools so well that the fans never really kick up above basically idle, keeping things to a hum.  It is not silent, no fan is, but it's about as close to silent as you are likely to get for a CPU cooler that still cools well when pegged to 100% CPU."," One little piece of the setup instructions wasn't as obvious as would have been nice, but it was easy enough to look at it and see what they meant.", No complaints.

The hardest part was screwing the fans into the radiator, but that was because I was only going one screw at a time.

I've had a few of them and I thought I'd give this one a try based on reviews here and on YouTube. None are really that hard to install, but this one was a breeze, esp. if you are planning to install at the top of your case. I can see how it might be finicky to install at the back of some cases but that wasn't an issue for me (used an NZXT case). It works perfectly fine.

Keeps idle temps at 38C while under 100% full load stability burn tests it hovers in the low 70s. CAM 2.0 software to manage the fan & pump speeds works well.

Not really a deal breaker or anything I just wanted more fine tuning options.," Excellent cooler, like it better then the H100i & H110 packages from Corsair. (have worked with both quite a bit) While not required I'm going to buy additional fans to put this in a Push/Pull config. (it already comes with the power adapters to run four fans built into it's wiring) If you're thinking about buying this for anything but high end overclocking this isn't required at all but if you want those 4.5-5ghz clocks it's something you should think about while ordering.",3,3

I purchased the Kraken X61 to install into my NZXT Phantom 530 case. The installation guide included was useless. The online installation guide is insufficient and inconvenient if you have only one computer. I was not able to fit the unit into the case the way the guide showed. After looking online at other people's installs, I decided to give one method a try. I installed the radiator on top of the inner case and the fans underneath. The screws were barely long enough to do this. I think someone needs to re-write the paper guide to include better illustrations and the alternate method of installation for shorter cases. Even their own. Not real happy as it took me 2 hours to finally get it in properly. After finishing the install, my system (Windows 7 64-bit) showed an ""Unknown Device"" in the Device Manager. I went online, downloaded, and installed the CAM software and voila, it did not fix it. The Cam software didn't recognize the Kraken unit. It showed CPU temp but no other information on the fans and no lighting or pump/fan control. After several methods of uninstalling and installing the cam software and the USB connector. The available online information was useless. I was at a loss. Device Manager still showed ""unknown device"". I have 20 years of experience with computers so I decided to take on this challenge. After researching the core components of the unit, Asetek, Inc's website was useless. No software or drivers and no support.  I dug deeper and found the manufacturer of the micro-controller the Kraken uses to communicate through the USB port to the computer. I found and installed the Silicon Lab's USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers. Finally a step forward. My Device Manager now showed a ""USB host controller"" with an error icon because of again, no drivers were found. After several hours of trying drivers and software from other brands cooling system which uses the same controller, again I was unsuccessful. After some doing, I got the DEV and VEN product information from the device and was able to find out what it was. I downloaded and installed the Intel® USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller Driver, all devices were finally recognized. After a few more tries of different variations of installing the CAM software, the CAM software still didn't recognize the Kraken. I just read that this is a known problem and is being worked on. Now on the second day, the rear fan is making noise. I will try the fix suggested here and make sure the (in my case, CPUFAN_1 port) is getting a constant 12 volts. I will return with the results.",1,3

I really didn't have problems with V1.2.3 but this new versions seems good., None for me.  Nothing I couldn't figure out.  Hopefully things stay that way.," Below I've listed the hardware in my case.  My hardware configuration has been very compatible with the Kraken X61 and CAM.  In CAM, all temps are accurate and it detects and lists all my hardware.  It's really worked good for me so far.  Maybe it's because I'm using Windows 8.1 64 bit or maybe CAM and the Kraken X61 interfaces well with my MB and BIOS and or the Processor.   I don't know.  All I know is it works and I've had it for about 1 month now and so far so good.   The LED light works well and adjusts fine also.    I've tried probably every color in the spectrum and it works as specified.  I can adjust the pump and fan just by manually adjusting the fan.   I'm writing this because I've read where some folks have had a problem with this cooling system and I don't doubt that's existed, but for me it's been great so far.  I'll put up more reviews as time goes by.   Also, the pump is very quiet.   Temps on my Intel 5820K are almost always around 23-26°C unless under load and then they haven't went above 34°c.

CAM software was only 1 degree off across all cores from actual. Software gives good info: core temp, liquid temp, fan speed, rpm, pump rpm, also cpu/gpu/fan graphs. Full adjustable logo light on cpu block makes it look great. Little noise at first from air working itself out goes away in short time, so not an issue just a heads up. Fans and pump run quiet on silent mode. Even with them at head level in the front of the case on mine can only head when ramped up."," Instructions.. If you have to use them and are not able to improvise, read up ahead of time from other sources. They only provide pics and they are so bad you cant translate them. I cant stress enough how bad the instructions are. Only issue I had was fan rpm not registering in cam software and tossing an error in the logs.

It effected the RPMs on the Kraken pump in a good way.  Previously the Pump RPMs registered at between 3100 and 3350rpms with the radiator fans set to 65% max speed.  Now with the radiator fans set a 65% max speed the RPMs on the pump register at between 2700 and 2900 RPMs and my coolant temp has dropped between 1 and 2°c.  This is good.  The fans don't make much noise anyway and now according to CAM, the pump isn't working as hard but yet my temps have dropped.   Now I've increased the fan speed to 75% which proportionately has increased the pump to between 2800rpms to 3000rpm which is still lower than it was prior to my BIOS update which is a good thing.  The lower the pump RPMs the easier job the pump has in my opinion.   The more I learn and update my system, the more I like the Kraken and the CAM software for that matter.   This is a really nice cooling system.  My CPU temp is approx 24°c  which in my opinion is quite good.   I'm sure you can tell I really like the Kraken X61 and the CAM software.  Not only that, since the BIOS update, my computer boots to windows about 10 seconds faster than it did before flashing the BIOS.  I'm at about 8 seconds boot time to windows now.  My point is, your BIOS version can absolutely effect the performance of the Kraken as well as the readings and performance of CAM.   I liked CAM before and now I like it even better.", None., I would certainly give the Kraken X61 and CAM a close look if I  were in the market for a 280mm liquid cooling system.

Instruction booklet does not give good info on certain bits and peaces you get I.E. there are extensions with short stubs and ones with long stubs for your pump installation and does not explain what is for what. Did not see a AMD or 2011/2011-3 installation guide. Thoe more info can be found at the website with a more in def manual.3. Gets loud when in high throttle mode but this is to be expected4.

Talking about 30C normal with a 4770k and 42C when running star citizen., So yes there is a story behind how i got this X61 my last X60 pumped died and had to RMA it since my computer did not like intel basic cooler set-up which was LOUD! Had been running my x60 non-stop and only turned off my computer maybe 6-8 times for minor maintenance and cleaning but been running for about 1yr and 4months and it decided to die on me well the pump part so contacted NZXT support gave them the info required had my old unit shipped for free (except paying for packaging which was cheap) got there within a week and they literally sent me the new one the very next day they got it which was quick! Of course i was expecting another x60 or a refurbished one of it but no they gave me a freaken X61 which i was like WHAT! THAT IS AWESOME! Even better the fans for the x61 worked better than the X60 fans and had even more SP so better for air going through the RAD. I got rid of the replacement fans i had for the x60 and used those instead.

According to the monitoring software, the CPU has yet to get any hotter then 36 degrees C."," This system is certainly a no frills system.  The control software is pretty basic (not quite a nice as the Corsair) and the LED lights on the CPU cooler are very basic.  None of these; however, affect the performance of this system.  My biggest complaint was that this NZXT Kraken doesn't fit correctly in NZXT's own Phantom case.  I had to really do some custom work to mount the radiator to the top of the case.`",,1,2

I mounted it in the front of a Corsair 450D and have a Kraken x41 in the roof for my 4970K overclocked.  Both show up in CAM and work perfectly.  Not sure why others are fussing about CAM, it works great on my system with dual Kraken's keeping everything cool and silent.  Because of the extra long tubes NZXT uses, it was easy to get from the G10 to the front of the 450D!"," Hard to find a case that can support a 280mm radiator and fans.  Fans that come with it are a bit loud at >65%, especially compared to the Kraken x41 stock fan.  If you select silent profile in CAM, you can barely hear them over ambient.  However, I will be replacing with Phanteks PH-F140XP_BK 140mm PWM Case Fans for super silent operation."," I moved from a full custom water loop running 3 rads, dual pumps, full cover GPU waterblock to this dual AIO set up for ease of use.  Funny part is that using dual AIO's from NZXT keeps my components just as cool  as the loop with only slightly more noise that cost over $1000 and doesn't require special water, water changes, or leak testing.   I am going to aution all that gear and the massive Case Labs case now that these are so clean and simple.",1,3

CAM software is a good alternative if you do not already have fan control. Very adjustable RGB lighting on the  pump allows you to match it to your color scheme, CAM software does not allow for good pump speed and lower fan rpm like Asus Fan Expert and doesnt give you any more info that youre not already getting from other better programs.," This cooler is pricey but if you're using a NZXT  case, which i recommend you do, its a perfect match and has great performance. However, when I hooked everything up according to the instructions and used the CAM software i had issues. The fan speed would not go below 900 rpm and when the pump speed drops below 2000rpm is makes funky noises. I have a Asus z97 motherboard so I ended up hooking the pump power straight to my PSU and connecting the fans to the CPU fan header. I then used CAM to change the LED color and deleted it from my computer lol. The Asus AI Suite does a much better job of controlling the fan speed and leaving the pump on constant power works great and is inaudible. If you're motherboard doesnt have on board fan control, i guess this would be ok but, who doesnt have fan speed management already that is looking at a product like this?",None,None

Best all in one cooler by far after some problem solving (read ""other thoughts"").  CAM software is a bit to be desired as it takes up a lot of resources for what it is, but it's ok - gets the job done.  I love the huge fans, RGB LEDs, and thin low-profile of the rad.  I actually went from a Corsair 450D to the NZXT S340 case and my system is now nice and tightly compact and a powerhouse with the X61 in it.  My Corsair H100i died on me so I figured I'd give this a shot, and at first I was not impressed but after troubleshooting I have completely changed my stance.  Sorry NZXT!  I love your products and I jumped the gun on my last review which was very wrong of me.  SO YES! If you're thinking about it, BUY IT!"," Had to troubleshoot to get it working correctly, but it was more than likely a BIOS issue than NZXT's fault.  Not sure though, because my previous brand all-in-one had no issues on the same MB.  After I got it working it's solid as &^%$.  I do think that the bracket around the heatsink could be of better quality.  It's cheaply made stamped steel."," After bashing this to $#|t here on Newegg I finally found the problem.  I have an Asus X99 Deluxe and for some reason if the CPU Fan (in BIOS) isn't turned up to ""Max Power"" the pump makes a ton of noise (grinding and clicking coming from the heatsink - YES NZXT I mounted everything correctly).  I had this happen with two units back to back.  I kept returning them and after hours of tinkering I found the issue in BIOS.  It seems that for some reason the voltage or timing being sent to the CPU fan matters.  Like I said above I'm not sure if this problem is exclusive to the Asus X99 Deluxe or not...

I bought this as well as a NZXT Kraken G10 to mount this product to my GPU and my temps are phenomenal! This cools my GTX 780 TI much more than a Corsair H100i, and pulls it off much quieter, with a stylish green LED logo on the back of the pump. It was also quite easy to mount with a wide variety of options. I find a lot of radiators don't include the short screws to go from the case straight to the radiator, but I'm glad to see this one come with a good amount. The long screws are also long enough to go through my case and fans without hitting the copper fins inside the radiator."," Sadly, there wasn't sufficient tubing to mount this where I originally planned to, causing me to have to mount it onto the top and move my CPU cooler to the back of my PC.",,None,None

CAM software does have some bugs, but from what I understand, it is far better than it used to be."," Just to help anyone who may be looking to get this (or who already has it and is getting frustrated: The CAM software will not report fan RPMs (biggest complaint I have heard). However, this is not a problem with the software. There are four fan headers that come from the pump. Only one has a fourth tachometer pin, so to fix the RPM issue, simply take one of the fans from a three pin fan header to the four pin fan header. That's how you gain control of the fan speeds.",3,3

Later around 09/01/02014I started getting weird symptoms. The symptoms were that the pump and fans would not go above ~2000RPM even at 100%. Heck, the fans would only go to 900RPMs and stay there while the pump went to 1920RPMs. The speeds at which the pump and fans ran at different % settings would vary and nothing was too solid so I contacted NZXT which confirmed I needed a replacement.

You can set up fan profiles, and change the colors however you would like. It fits well in my NZXT H630, I have noticed alot of the other reviews, comment on the size of this cooler, if it is not obviously listed as the title, as well as in the specifications, yes this is a large radiator. Don't buy it if you don't have adequate space, I'm not sure why people are listing this as a con, as there are tons of other coolers out there for size. This one works probably the best on the market at the moment, But do keep in mind it is a large cooler and you will need to have some headroom to fit it + fans.

The only tricky part with installation was that I had to remove the rear case fan to slide the radiator into place, and if I'd mounted the radiator before attaching the CPU block, I wouldn't have had that problem.Under load, with fans at 25%, it's keeping a 5960X at a paltry 40 degrees. I have yet to start overclocking the chip, but I have absolutely no doubts that this cooler is going to give me plenty of headroom to do so. The sleeved cables on the unit were another pro. In general, they blend out of my build, but if you do notice them, they're a nice, elegant touch. Added bonus: Since I was building in a NZXT H440, the included fans matched the rest of my case fans. I really do like the fan quality included with this kit, they perform well and are very quiet."," Minor problems with the included software. The LED color keeps reverting to it's standard gradient of blue - red rather than keeping the color I've specified to tie in with the rest of my case lighting.

I installed the cam feature, started playing with the lights and all that good jazz. Ran some stress test just to see how cool it would keep my processor. On the second day of my new build I notice that the led on the block was acting weird and discolored. It turned Red for like 2 seconds then went back to the original color that I had it which was a dark blue. So I check the temps again after it came back on, all running fine, so i decided to give my computer another shutdown to see if it will change colors again. (This is where the **** hits the fan.) I turned it back on and it started flashing yellow and red, seconds later I see smoke coming from the block(TONS OF SMOKE) the fans are running at full speed so I quickly shut off the power to my power supply.As any other PC builder would guess, Tator Tots..my processor..my mobo...all gone!

N82E16835146042,35-146-042,8/28/2014 5:58:37 AM,Justin N.,Better than expected.,4," This review will be in three parts.  The actual products results, the installation with a G10 and the software.Starting with the X61 itself, it's nothing short of amazing for a cooling solution if you don't want to do your own custom loop.  Temps on GPU1 idle down from 50-55 to 30-35c.  Under load the max temp I've hit so far was 58c running Crysis 3 @ 2160p where I had previously been running into severe thermal throttling on my GPUs.  So for it's cooling efficiency I give this an easy 5/5.  Fans that come with it easily do the job, no need to replace them.The actual installation process for the G10 bracket sold by NZXT was far easier than I was expecting.   This is in part due to MSI making it very easy to remove their stock cooler though.I had my stock cooler and old thermal tapes off in about 3-5 minutes. Usually this is one of the most tedious issues you'd run into.  Mounting the bracket itself is very easy, simply choose if you want your fan blowing onto the PCB, or venting heat off.For Crossfire/SLI configurations I suggest venting rather than blowing onto the card.So far it's a few degrees cooler.A big thing to remember is to REPLACE your thermal tape for multi-GPU setups.  If you're running one card with good air flow in the case you will be fine. But otherwise USE VRM heatsinks of some kind. Whether it be tape, or copper modules.This is another area that NZXT expected work, the G10 bracket doesn't go over, or sit too tightly on most GPU models so you have room to put as many VRM heatsinks on your PCB as you need.  I personally have 8, which is more than doing the job using one of the hottest running GPUs on the market @ 2160p.  So if I can't overheat it, you shouldn't be able to either.I'd say this is 3/5 ease of installation.  If you're considering GPU liquid cooling for your first time there are tons of video guides on how to apply the G10 with an NZXT pump.  Great place to start.Now for the bad news. The software is complete bunk.  Sometimes when you boot up, it will work, others it'll just post temps but have no fan speed/rpm controls.The remote temp monitor is what I really wanted out of this only to find out it still isn't available for Android.

NZXT's CAM software is a great idea, it has a great sleek look too it and you can monitor CPU/GPU speeds as well as the load on many of your componenets. anddd it allows you to control the LEDs on your liquid heatsink. all in all i think its a great start and it can only be improved."," -its definetly a larger radiator... but if you have a large enough case i wouldnt worry about it. so not enough to knock off an egg. -The software needs some updating, there has been a couple times where my software stops accelerating the fans based on coolant/CPU temps. and there are some unneccessary features that i wish i could minimize. but again its a great idea and can only get better with feedback and updates. - mounting bracket on heatsink is not the best one ive seen but it does the job"," couple of installation thoughts for you: - USE NZXT's original fans that come with the radiator. they are 4 pin and controllable to an arrange of speeds. and... there RPM's are fantastic you will really see the result on NZXT's CAM software. and if your worry about matching a color in your case... the fans are white so the will only reflect the color being shined in the case. - another thing, the mounting ring for the heatsink is... well kinda cruddy. be carefull when tightening it down. -again, all in all another awesome product by NZXT!",5,5

My ancient Phenom II 940 ran hotter than I was comfortable with at 3.3Ghz, and this cooler gave me some room to OC further. A tread I notice as I was OC'ing was there was about a 10C difference between idle and load temps. As I write this, 3.640Ghz@1.45V, I am Folding at full settings w/ temperature leveling off at 45C with two fans in push/pull."," I've read many of the other reviews prior to purchase, and I agree for a LED on the pump. It's utterly silent, which is great. But a LED signaling operational pump or to abandon ship is a definite plus. Instructions were simple, but they didn't work for me. I tried to mount the pump twice following the procedure laid out, but didn't work. So I had to use the method the instructions instructed not to do...laughable I know. Now my disdain for this product is the 120mm fan; possibly the sole reason why it receives 3 eggs. To label the fan as ""junk"" is an insult to junk else where. Failing at the most crucial time (Refer to Other Thoughts)"," This is a solid cooler for OC'ing without the fret of mounting a massive high-end cooler to achieve results. The thing that is highly suspect is the included 120mm fan; I suppose maybe I expected too much from Corsair. If you commit to this cooler, ditch the fan and opt for your own; better safe than sorry.I guess I'll start by saying I like to keep my CPU under 60C firm. After several days of minor OC'ing tweaks and great results, I really start to push the envelope. At my CPUs very limit of 3.8GHz, I ran Prime for about 15 hrs straight, but I had to step away for several hours. I return home to see the welcome screen, so I rebooted and increased the voltage to try Prime once more. Except this time my temps rocketed to 65C before I could end the test. Fearing pump failure I investigate to realize the fan failed. Even now, I shudder at the thought of my CPU hitting its 70C ceiling at idle, who knows how many times, before I came home.

For the most part, I am impressed. The tread I've notice as I OC is there's about a 10C difference b/w idle and load temps with a single fan setup (refer to CON): At 3.608ghz full load it's at 54C and it idles at 42C. It's super quiet, which leads me to CONS."," I wish there was an LED or something on the water block to warn me the pump has failed or to abandon ship. I've read the reviews prior to purchase, and I agreed entirely. It's so quiet, there's no way of knowing other than, in my case, a stable temp on Core Temp (Speedfan isn't working for me for some odd reason). The 120mm that came with the cooler is complete utter garbage. Was running Prime for about 15-16 hrs @ 3.81 and I had to step out for several hours. I came back to the login screen, so I, carelessly, upped the voltage and ran Prime for not even a minute and my CPU got lit up! Was barely able to end the test. Inspected the radiator and notice the fan has stopped spinning. Ultimately I had to use one of case fans. Who knows how many time my CPU at idle hit 70C when I was away."," This is the very first time I've ever given anything on Newegg three eggs. I truly have mix feelings about this cooler. I suppose a part of me had too much expectations for this cooler; especially considering my room is the very coldest in the entire house. But the difference between idle and load temps speaks for itself. I think I ran into every conceivable problem installing it. I've mounted and unmounted it and its fans in more locations and orientations than I'd like to; it does not play nicely with the Antec Lanboy Air. Can't fault it I suppose. I should have know it was gonna be bad when the blades of the fan drew my blood. I couldn't even mount the water block using the method found on the instructions; tried it twice before I gave up and did it my way. Very seldom do I give five eggs, my default is four. Three eggs for this cooler because of the low-rent fan that was included that caused me way more grief than the installation ever did. A side note, if you can accommodate the H100, I'd pass on this and go with the dual rez. In hindsight, the price difference isn't too great, and I'd imagine greater performance with the dual rez and fans.",1,1

N82E16835181029,35-181-029,2/18/2013 5:30:09 PM,DAVID H.,GREAT COOLING ABILITY,4," This cooler was sent to me as a free item for review. Months of warranty problems with a video card that caused repeated crashes whenever the computer was under a load, delayed this build & review. I was impressed when I looked at the temps in my computer. All in all, its benefits outweigh the detractions. The MB sensor showed the CPU at way below room temp so I couldn’t use it. I used an IR thermometer to check temps of the CPU & other parts of the computer. I overclocked an AMD FX4100 3.6GHz Black Edition CPU to 4.5GHz for 24 hours in a 74°F room. The radiator showed 93°F, the hottest reading I could get from the side of the CPU was 97°F. The 8 hard drives ran between 83-87°F & the 970 chipset heat sink was 109°F. They include adapters for a wide variety of socket types. It does an excellent job of keeping the CPU cool. This design cools the CPU using the cooler outside air before anything else warms it up & avoids running the normally pre-warmed recycled air that accumulates in the case. The heat, like a regular CPU cooler goes into the case, but the absence of a bulky cooling assembly in the middle of the case allows for much better airflow, so everything else stays cooler because the airflow is better."," I had to give it 4 eggs because of the PCI-e slot blocked by the radiator. You may be able to mount a very short card there by temporarily removing the video card.Like a conventional CPU cooler, the radiator & hoses are still obstructions where they are located. When installed inside the case you need to make allowances for what the radiator may interfere with. It’s not designed to allow for the radiator to be mounted outside the case. Their website lists the screw specifications to get for a push/pull setup if you want to do that.In my case it prevented use of the PCIe expansion slot closest to the CPU so now I have an unusable PCIe card & I had to buy a less capable, more expensive, PCI SATA card that only supports 3Gb/s vs. 6Gb/s available with PCIe. All my HD’s are 6Gb/s rated.They are clearly relying on a picture/drawing being worth a 1000 words. The written instructions are extremely brief.The radiator may block or impede access to top mounted case fan and the 4-8 pin ATX power connection on the MB.The written instructions are extremely brief. They are clearly relying on a picture being worth a 1000 words, but these are drawings."," For most MB’s you will have to have it out to attach Corsair‘s back plate to match screw threads. For me it seemed easier & reduced the risk of damaging the radiator and/or MB if I completely attached my H50 to the MB while it was outside the case. I lined up the pump with the holding bracket in the locked position with the CPU and mounting holes then tightened the screws. I left the radiator hanging outside the case till I got MB mounted in the case with the 4-8 pin ATX power cable attached & the top case fan installed in the area the radiatior+fan would be mounted. Once everything is installed, the center area of the MB has lots of unobstructed space for air movement. It also gives you more room to work on connections to the drives or other parts inside the case.Since it is recommended that you have the radiator fan blow air into the case, you may want to change one of the normal intake fans into an exhaust fan; otherwise you will lose efficiency of air moving through the case.Their website lists the screw specifications to get for a push/pull setup if you want to do that.",0,1

When the room temp (setup with air in from the room) is high then the cpu temp, though within tolerance is not going to be 80 degrees F. Still, this device really looks cool. It allows for maintenance on the motherboard. Access to the system fan connectors and RAM  modules is easy now. The 4/6 pin board power connector is easy to reach too. The radiator is much easier to clean than the air cooled fin type cpu cooler.

Some motherboards (including mine: an MSI Z77A-GD55) will only do speed control on the CPU fan connector through 4-pin PWM control and not voltage reduction.  I presume this is because the Intel spec for CPU fans is for 4-pin fans.The H50 that this replaces in Corsair's line-up came with a 4-pin fan.  I'm not sure why Corsair cheaped out on the fan for the H55, especially given that they didn't lower the price vs the H50.The install guide is also out of date.  The H55 includes a new plastic retention clip versus the old models that allows you to connect the pump block to the mounting bracket first and then screw the whole thing into the motherboard in one shot, instead of the old method of having to partially screw the bracket onto the motherboard first, then slide the pump block under the clips (which can be finicky), and then tighten.  The included install guide is the same as old versions and makes no reference to this new clip - meaning some buyers may never use it.  For the price of these things, Corsair could have at least stuck an addendum sheet in the box."," If you want a PWM fan, make sure you factor that into cost.  For those who want to know how to use the new retention clip, there's a Hi Tech Legion review on YouTube that demonstrates how to use it.",6,7

Size of the unit is decent, not to large, not too small. Make sure you have space in your case for a 120MM fan for mounting.Installed on an AMD 975BE proc, with a Gigabyte AM3+ motherboard, 8GB ram.I added my 120MM case fan I was already using to the unit and setup as a push pull. I was previously using an aftermarket Air Cooler (Titan) with heat pipes and fins which was not bad, but it could not beat this H55 watercooler! The H55 is definitely quiet; I don’t really hear much from it. (my video card fan makes more noise than it does). Tubes were flexible and overall seems and looks really nice.After installation, my average temps during idle / typical usage were not significantly improved, and I found that the other temps in my case went up a little as I think it is moving a little less air out of the system than before. (I have an older style Antec tower)However my temps when really utilizing the processor (games, video editing etc.. ) this is where it really made a difference. I’ve included a chart below to show some examples. I ran these tests on different days at different times and ambient temps. (I used the same video editing software and file for each test.)Temps are in FahrenheitCooler| scenario | Outside Tmp | Ambient Tmp | CPU TmpAir Cooler | Normal use       | 64-67 | 74  |  97-98Air Cooler	| Video Editing	   | 64-67 | 74  | 128-129Air Cooler	| Video Editing 2 | 64-67 | 74	| 129-130Air Cooler	| Normal use	   | 65      | 75	| 97-98H55	| Normal use	           | 79      | 75   | 90H55	| Video Editing	           | 79	| 75 	| 110H55	| Normal use               | 38       | 68  | 87H55	| Video Editing	           | 78	| 74  | 110"," Instructions were not the greatest, there was a round plastic band that came with it which I did not use, and was not included anywhere in the instructions. (Guessing it was for a particular intel board).Would have been nice if it came with extra screws for mounting an additional fan. I managed to add my additional fan with other screws I had around."," This was a great improvement on my CPU temps, not a major difference at idle, but definitely a noticeable difference when the system is under heavy load. I have been quite happy with the stock 3.6Ghz of my proc and did overclock it to 4.0 at one point on the air cooler, but the temps were pushing it a little more than I wanted, and to be honest I’m still quite happy with the performance at stock speed, but.. that being said.. I may consider an overclock again sometime in the future with this new cooler!",3,3
N82E16835181029,35-181-029,11/28/2012 5:36:46 AM,Jack W.,Great liquid cooler starter,5," This is an enclosed water cooling system and very quiet. It is fairly easy to install. If you are upgrading from another cooler, you may have to remove you motherboard to place this cooler's back mounting bracket. The tubing is more flex able than the H50. The heat sink/pump has a lower profile than the H50. Because the heat sink/ pump has a compact design, you don't have to worry about it overlapping any of you system components like you would with most sir coolers. As you can tell, it come s with a 120mm fan. The cooler comes with all the necessary hardware needed for mounting on motherboards with Intel sockets LGA 1155, 1156, 1366,  and AMD Socket AM2, AM3, FM1, FM2. The cooler can go into pretty much any size case."," The first con that comes to mind is pricing. It is a little costly compared to air coolers. Given the fact that this cooler doesn't drop the cpu temp any lower than a well known air cooler, the price is kind of high but then you have to deal with the size of the air cooler which is a negative for an air cooler. There isn't any hardware support for Intel LGA 775 (the H50 does or I should say did. At least the one I bought did. Seems they may have changed the structure of the H50 now). Only comes with one fan (see other thoughts)."," When placing the heat sink as you need to place paste on both the processor and heat sink, leave the screws on the bracket a little loose so you can lock the heat sink and slightly lower it to get a paste impression from the processor. This will give you an imprint to place the paste. Don't over tighten the mounting. Snug is more than enough. Another recommendation is to get a second 120mm fan and set the two fans up in a push/pull manner where one fan pushes air through the radiator while the second pulls air through. This provides more cooling. If adding a second fan makes it too bulky in the case, place one fan outside the case. This may mean you may have to get longer screws and maybe a fan cover as the blades will be exposed. Set the air flow where the fan/s are pulling air from the outside to inside the case. If it's reversed you may be pulling hot air within the case through the radiator. I really wouldn't recommend getting this cooler if you plan on doing any serious overclocking. I would look at the H80 and up for that and that may be a stretch. But, you can do a little OC and everything should be safe. As this is my second H series cooler, I currently have the H50 cooling a Core2Duo processor at stock speed with a constant temp of  27c and this system is on 24/7 as it's my NAS box. On a i5 2500k processor once again at stock speeds, the temps stayed around 28-30c. I did try OCing on the i5 and was able to go from 3.7Ghz to 4.7Ghz (OC) and with 100% load the temps ran up to 78-79c before I stopped the test. You do not want temps at 80c or more. So, you can OC a little but understand temps will be up. These really aren't made for OCing.",3,5
N82E16835181029,35-181-029,11/24/2012 12:12:49 PM,James O.,"Superb Product, Best Cooler I Ever Had!",5," Wow.  Let me begin by saying that this is an amazing product.  I've used many Corsair products before - power supplies, RAM, etc. and I figured this would be just as high-quality.  Well it is.  First off, the packaging had the classic minimalist Corsair look and it was and it did indeed come with all of the parts necessary to install this on any Core i3/5/7 or AMD AM2, AM3, and FM1 chipset.  And in case you don't have a case fan to install the radiator on, this product comes with an extra 120mm fan.Installation was surprisingly easy compared to many other CPU coolers I've installed.  The instructions were clear and concise, but just make sure you get the right size screws for your mounting bracket - there are Intel and AMD sized screws depending on your CPU.  As was advertised, the product is very compact and easy to install, and the rubber hoses are quit flexible.  Don't bend them too much, however, because you don't want a leak.  Try to install the cooler in such a way that the hoses are not stretched too far or bent out of shape.Now, in my case, I was working with a computer that I built about a year ago so it already had an air cooler on the CPU.  I had to remove that and clean up the previous thermal paste using an emulsifier.  I also removed the pre-applied thermal paste from the Corsair product because I wanted to use my own Arctic Cooler paste.  In any case, all of that took only 20 minutes or so.Luckily my computer case had a CPU cutout so installing the mounting brackets was a breeze.  If you don't have a cutout behind the CPU in your case, then you'll have to remove your entire motherboard which will add time to the installation procedure.After getting the mounting bracket in place it was quite, quite easy to screw in the radiator and lock the actual cooling cap in place on top of the CPU.  Just be sure that when you install the mounting bracket that you do it methodically.  It involves a back-plate, a front-plate, 4 screws, and 4 little metal things that the screws go into.  Positioning the back-plate correctly was difficult at first until I noticed the (rather hard to read) lettering next to each hole.  Each hole is designated either 1156, 1366, or 2011.  Know this and you'll save yourself a lot of frustration.Continue to ""Other Thoughts"" for some numbers.", None whatsoever!  Just a little note: installation should be done methodically.  Don't rush it because this is a delicate device with many little parts involved.  Many of the problems I encountered during installation were due to my own lack of attention.  Read the instructions and carefully inspect all parts so that you know exactly how to install it before you even open your computer case.," I tested this cooler on a Core i3 540.Using Speed Fan, I measured my CPU temperatures before and after installation.  My air cooler, which consisted of a 90mm fan, heatsink, and copper pipes, gave me 22 and 27 degrees Celsius on each core at idle.  Playing a video game like Skyrim or Unreal Tournament 3, I got 42 and 44 degrees C.  This was with air cooling.With the new Corsair liquid cooler, I got 18 and 23 C idle (4 degrees lower), and 30 and 35 degrees C under load.  That's a 9 to 12 degree drop from before!  Basically, with this liquid cooler my i3 540 runs nearly as cool under load as it used to merely idling with the air cooling.This is a marvelous liquid cooler, and in fact my first liquid cooling device of any kind.  I love the closed loop design and it's extremely quiet.  You won't even hear it unless you put your ear right up to your computer.I highly recommend this product for any computer.  It would be especially useful for a gaming computer, and for someone who wants to make a gaming computer with superior cooling on a budget.  Even family computers would benefit from this because it will definitely prolong the life of your CPU.Just be sure you know what you're doing.  Liquid cooling always has the risk of leaking, but 99% of the time it's due to poor installation - bending or stretching the hoses in some way they shouldn't be, not screwing things in properly, etc.",14,14
N82E16835181029,35-181-029,11/23/2012 7:23:29 AM,Anonymous,Nice improvement over the H50,5," Nice improvement over the H50, which is now 2-3 years old.  The H55 has more flexible tubing, a better block, and is easier to install.  Compared to the H50, the H55 keeps my mildly overclocked i7-3770K 2-3 degrees cooler under load.  Idle temps are the same.  (These temps are keeping all other components and settings equal.) The biggest improvements IMHO are the much more flexible hoses which make management much easier and the easier to install block.  Though I don't swap out CPU coolers often, these are nice touches."," Dubious value compared to midrange air coolers.  In my experience neither the H50 nor H55 provide much benefit compared to the more popular air coolers that are typically less than $40 - in terms of cooling efficacy.  However, I use these in SFF systems where the larger tower coolers simply won't fit, so they let me squeeze a bit more performance out of a cramped computer at a small price."," I don't recommend the H50 to novice builders because it's a bit of a PITA to install.  I would, however, recommend the H55 to a less experienced system assembler because of its vastly improved block mounting procedure.One thing to note is that it's best to use the rad's fan as a system intake so you're pulling cooler external air over the radiator rather than pushing warmer internal air over the radiator.  This might result in reversing the air flow found in most systems (that go from front to back, whereas with this, you'll probably want to go from back to front).",10,12

I am thinking about buying a second one and the bracket to cool my r290x its that good., loud at 100% fan speed., room temp was 74F with fans pushing air out top(they recommend it pull in from the top for max cpu cooling but in my view that would raise the case temp higher forcing higher gpu temps so I didn't try it that way.) used artic 5 thermal paste. when it comes to the cpu standoffs and screws just snug them down by hand I didn't even use a screw driver. don't over tighten them or u will pay like the other reviews say. my case is a mid case fractal design and I had to bend the top cd bay support a little to clear the end of the rad. cant wait to see what over clocking I can do with the 30F degree cooling range I have available.,0,1

I have an old LanLi box from 2007 that I modified by cutting the floor out of the botton drive bays and relocating my hard drive carriage back to make room to mount my H105 to the front fan and push hot air out of the case through the front. I managed to mount 3 fans and it never gets hotter than 63c. i plugged the pump in chassis #3 because it was closest the motor is a four pin so it runs full all times (non pwm). I used the fan splitter to run 2 fans on CPU  and the 3rd on CPU OPT. I know people  says use stock thermal paste... NO WAAAAY. I pealed the stock paste off the water block and it came of like a thin sheet of rubber... I look at it this way the h105 sits on a shelf at the manufacturer til the retailer places the order then it gets put in a sea crate in temps over hundred degrees put on a cargo liner to arrive at a loading dock where it sits to clear customs than the 18 wheeler for delivery where it sits on a shelf til purchased... ALL this while not in an air tight box.... arctic silver5 super cheap FTW... I used the GeLid fans instead of stock 120mm. I waited for a couple of months to give this unit time to fail... the only fail is me waiting so long to make the switch to liquid and quiet., dump the air cooler overclock your junk and go for the LC.(liquid cooler)," use other fans than the stock ones , they are ok but spin high.donot use the stock thermal paste read above for my rant.",2,2

It wasn't too difficult to install, but it's big, I mean really big. Some cases will give you a hard time for it, and most of the screws were useless on my C70 vengeance rig.My main, and at the moment, only complaint about this cooler is the instructions vague descriptions of the types of screws used to mount the cooling head onto the processor. They include hanger bolts/screws with threading on either side of the block of metal in the middle. This is what provides the right amount of space between the cooler and processor as well as fastening the whole contraption to the motherboard itself. In the instructions, they attempt to show you which screws are used. However, they don't name the screws in the instructions with corresponding titles to labeled screw baggies, they just include a picture of which screw to use for which socket type. And I kid you not, the differences on the pictures within the context of how the screws look in your hand is nearly indistinguishable. Instead of showing a picture of which screw to use directly from the side of the screw, so you can easily see what the threading looks like on the screw that you should use, they show an off-angled picture of the screw and make it virtually impossible to tell if you have the right screw.Needless to say, I picked the wrong one and overheated my CPU a couple of times until I figured out my mistake on my own.It's an amazing cooler, just make sure your cooler is actually touching your cpu.",None,None
N82E16835181060,35-181-060,8/24/2015 8:57:07 AM,Mukesh P.,Best AIO water cooler I have ever used,5," Well, Corsair outdid themselves.  This AIO cooler actually matches the H110 quite handily.  So, if you are looking for the best AIO cooler but don't really have the space for a 280MM radiator, then you just found it.1.  Excellent cooling...my i7-5820K will not get past 60 deg C even under Prime95 Blend Torture Test, and the cores all idle in the low 20s.2.  Thicker radiator, which certainly helps with the temps.3.  Uses the new mounting scheme (metal back plate, separate bolt mounts for the thumb screws) which is easier to work with and far sturdier.  Not only that, but the new mounting scheme allows remounts to different motherboards easily since the old plastic back plate used double-sided foam tape that would only work one time and was really difficult to remove.4.  Very quiet, since my cores don't get past 60 deg C even under a 4 hour Prime95 load I never do hear the fans.5.  Hoses are pretty flexible and pivot at the pump head.6.  Interchangeable ""rings"" at the top of the pump head with blue, read, or the default color if you want to customize the look.  I just used the default.7.  Corsair logo glows white, and I do like that.  Classy."," The thicker radiator might cause you some clearance issues with some motherboards and some cases in a top mount setup especially...so do your homework.

I'll be pushing it further soon.  Frees up a lot of space in my case from the old heatsink.  Also, it looks great.  Install was very simple.  Includes a fan cable splitter in case you are concerned about being short on those, and enables you to put both fans on the CPU fan slot of your motherboard.Fans run very quiet."," It is large, but that's probably true of all radiators of this size.  I had some difficulty mounting it in my Antec P280 case.  I had planned on installing it on top, but there's maybe 1/16th of an inch too little space.  I had to install the fans on the outside of the case.  This is my fault for poor planning, but do double check your mounting location!"," I freaked out when I powered it up and heard a gurgle.  I thought it was going to leak, but it seems it was just part of the initial start up.  I haven't heard it since.  Also, there was a little slack in the mounting hardware of the water block where it attaches to the AMD backplate.  This turns out to be a non-issue though, despite my initial consternation.  After installing the water block and tightening the screws, it pulls the slack out of the mounting bracket.  Just keep in mind that it might not attach snug to the motherboard prior to installing the block.",1,1

N82E16835181060,35-181-060,4/15/2015 9:43:17 PM,Gregory M.,I like it!,5," Works great.  Very easy to install.  Keeps my i7-4970K running cool at all times.  I have mine mounted vertically (hoses up) in the front of a Fractal Design case Define R5.  It's a wide case that comes stock with 140mm fans.  I would have bought the H110i GT (just for the hell of it, it's an overkill system) if it had been available for sale anywhere (way to go Corsair!).  This cooler is plenty for my needs however.  The fans move a lot of air, which you can hear.  Part of the reason I got the R5 case was to have the option of closing the front door, which reduces the noise from the front-mounted fans significantly.  I generally open the doors during gaming to increase airflow, and the sound drowns out the noise then anyway.I can't hear any noise from the pump itself.I couldn't find my Arctic Silver thermal grease when it was time to install.  I didn't want to hold up my new build,so I tried using the factory applied TIM that comes on the cooling block.  Has worked well enough so far, and made installation that much easier.  If I ever decide to replace, the easy installation process is just as simple to reverse.Although somewhat trivial, I appreciated the choice of color trim rings for the cooling block (I have a blue themed build).  I also like the fact that the logo on the block lights up, though only in an off-white color which can't be changed or adjusted as with the ""i"" models (oh well)."," No real operational cons noticed after a couple months.  The fans make noise due to the amount of air being moved, but still at moderate levels.  This new build is still significantly quieter than my last system.  The one con I have is in regards to the back-plate they use for mounting the cooling block.  It is made of plastic rather than metal (compared with some of their other models).  It still mounts in a seemingly secure fashion, but gets distorted in a somewhat frightening manner when tightening fully.  May need to use caution not to overtighten to the point where the threaded piece pulls through the plastic 'socket'.  Not worth docking an egg, but I wish they would spend a few cents more for a metal bracket."," When I first start up the system, I can hear a small amount of gurgling if I listen closely, but it dissipates after about 5 seconds.  Not sure if that is due to the vertical mounting?  No complaint - just thought other people considering vertical mounting might be interested to know that it works fine overall.I have my radiator mounted as recommended, with the fans towards the outside of the case, blowing outside air through the radiator into the case.  Probably cools the CPU a little better, but heats up the air inside the case more.  If I had mounted in the roof, I would have used it to exhaust the case air out through the top.  However, I didn't want the extra noise escaping from the otherwise sound-proofed case I purchased, plus I didn't want the dust and dirt that falls through openings in the top.  Part of my design choice -  going for quiet and clean in this build, as well as power when needed.",None,None

More radiator surface means more cooler ability.  I made a good decision with regard to product quality and ability (not so much on my compatibility research; see other thoughts).I have the H105 on a i7-4790K and the cooling power is perfect.  About 30 Celsius at idle and about 40 Celsius under load.tl;drDespite my necessary placement of the radiator in the front intake, the H105 still performs perfectly."," Since I had to put the radiator vertically in the front intake (see other thoughts), I occasionally hear the liquid gurgling.  I don’t believe an egg should get cracked for this since they clearly recommend that it be mount on the top, or at the least above the CPU pump.  My bad.  I am putting it as a con since I didn’t expect for it to have as much air as it appears to have.tl;drIf you don’t put it above the CPU, as recommended, then you may get gurgling from the air bubbles. No broken eggs since they give a clear recommendation."," I did an oops on my research.  I attempted to install the H105 on the top in the Corsair Obsidian Series 350D MicroATX case.  Corsair listed the H105 as compatible for the 350D in a short bullet point.  Well… its only compatible in the front intake and NOT the top vent.  The radiator is too thick and wide.  The motherboard prevents it from lining up with the screw holes at the top.  Even if I could figure it out, it would have been a very tight fit with a DVD drive in the top bay.If I attempted to do the math or even a simple forum search, I would have found out that it wouldn’t fit on the top.  After a lot of personal debating, I decided to try the front installation.  It actually turned out to be the best solution for my particular build anyway.  My wife insists on having the PC in a (luckily opened) desk PC cabinet.  The intake from the top would not have enough cool air intake.I moved the front intake fan to the top as an exhaust.  So I have the dual fan radiator as an intake in the front and one exhaust on the top and one out the back.

I had to stop mid install and go buy one at a local cpu-cooling store (luckily there was one near me) once I got that installed the cooler went in fairly easy.   I messed up a little cause the clips for the H60 pump were tough (if you have big hands like me) and the hoses on the cooler were a little stiff to maneuver on the cpu.    With that it caused the compound to rub off on the cpu so I took it out and used the Artic cleaner and surface puifier and used some other thermal compound."," If you're putting this on a AMD board ,  latch the side clips that come with the H60 in first on the retention module and set the cooler on top when you're ready to mount it if you can.

Running Prime 95 with 8 virtual cores on my 3770k (mildly overclocked to 4.1Gh) had all cores running around 58C."," Could have been a bit clearer in the manual about the electrical connectors. I called Corsair and clarified that the 4-pin radiator fan connector can be allowed to be speed controlled by the bios, but the 3-pin pump connector should NOT be allowed to vary the pump speed which should be on full at all times since below a certain voltage the pump can stop altogether."," The gen 2 model appears to have a simplified mounting bracket, quieter higher torque fan and larger hoses. While my ASRock z77 motherboard has both  4 & 3 pin CPU fan headers, I had to use a separate 3-pin chassis fan header to prevent the pump from throttling down along with the radiator fan. Also, I had to change the CPU fan setting from full to variable in the BIOS. At full the radiator fan was loud but when allowed to modulate it was very quiet.  Interestingly the bios fan controller reported the pump rpm at 4,600 rpm. Hope it lasts! Also, because of the thicker and less flexible hoses I mounted the pump on the CPU rotated counterclockwise 90 degrees (Corsair logo goes down to up) to take the torque strain off the CPU pump mount caused by the thicker hoses.

I can't hear it over the PSU fan which is almost non-existent.Radiator and fan fit inside the case as long as you have a spot for a 120mm fan.The unit is a self contained liquid cooler and no need to attach any hoses or fill the radiator. The liquid tubes are very secure and a bit stiff like an automotive fuel line. I can't imagine this ever springing a leak inside your case.Easy mounting / fast installation but you must have a spot for an external case fan. The CPU brackets are great and extremely easy to install. (Keeps quad-core Intel 1156 under 40c usually. I find that not having a huge bulky air cooler int the center of the case helps with overall air flow, temperature control. and cable management. Very clean looking case.The fan and pump connects to a 3 or 4 pin connector on the motherboard using a single connector so pump and fan speed is controlled by the same connection."," Liquid tubes a bit short for some case configurations. May require some fancy placement of wires and cards.Okay this is nit picking, but the  instructions are not clear on how tight to make the pump sit on the CPU. My experience is just hand tighten (snug) each of the screws but tighten them evenly. I tighten opposite screws by hand at the same time."," I also have the H80 with 2 fans which is a bit larger and requires you to have more room in your case. In a way i like the H60 with the ability to control the pump and fan speed with the BIOS over the H80's 3 position controller.The radiator fan blows the air inward from the outside so if you have the ability to place the radiator in a different spots, try to avoid putting it close to where the PSU (power supply) is expelling hot air. I put a thin shroud on the back of my gaming case to deflect the PSU air upwards.Painting a radiator is usually not a good idea (hence a car's radiator is usually pure aluminum). I wonder if it would stay cooler if they were not painted black? It's hard to tell if the inside is completely painted as well. The paint would hinder the cooling. Use the thermal paste on the unit. The machine even coat and substance works wonderfully. Brother tried using Arctic Silver with no effect.",1,1

HAF 932 computer case (2x 200mm fan in front and on top, 2x 120mm fan on top and in back). GTX 570 video card. 8GB's RAM (4x2GB G.Skill Sticks). Tests were performed using Prime95 with an average of 2 hours per test. To compare results I will be using my previously installed air cooler: a Tuniq Tower 120 Extreme modded with a blue LED NFB Gelid fan and NT-H1 CPU paste. Room temp is ambient 70F.Tuniq at stock speeds:-30c @ idle-48c @ loadTuniq with 3.4ghz OC:-31c @ idle-50c @ loadTuniq with 3.8ghz OC:-35c @ idle-57c @ loadTuniq with 4.2ghz OC:-45c @ idle-Blue Screen @ loadH60 at stock speeds:-27c @ idle-40c @ loadH60 with 3.4ghz OC:-29c @ idle-46c @ loadH60 with 3.8ghz OC:-33c @ idle-51c @ loadH60 with 4.2ghz OC:-38c @ idle-56c @ loadAnything after a 4.2ghz OC and voltage increase causes a blue screen, no matter the temperature beforehand. This is probably the physical limitation of the CPU, and not the H60 cooler.And now some facts!Self-contained means no fussing with messy liquids or worrying about damaging spills! As with all water coolers, of course the threat of a leak is still there, but a month later and my cooler is still dry and kicking! You also don't have to worry about filling it ever. Installation was insanely easy, and the instructions provided were useful for setup. It adds a level of professionalism to your case, and looks good in my PC. I imagine it would look good in any PC, just slap on an LED fan of your choice! It's also small form factor and will fit well in most cases, and is especially useful for cases with little head room between the door and the CPU."," Price is always going to be a con of any water cooler setup, and the H60 is no different. Worse, in fact. It performed better than my $60 Tuniq Tower 120 extreme, which is good, but it's priced in comparison to far better performing air coolers such as the Megahalems or the ever glorious and much cheaper Hyper 212. *Remember though, these larger air coolers won't always fit in smaller cases, and that's where the H60 shines.*That's really the only true con about the unit. Remember to read the ""Other Thoughts"" section if you're unfamiliar or need more information about how ""self-contained"" liquid coolers work, they aren't for everyone!"," Many of you are going to be reading these reviews wondering if water cooling really is a reasonable solution. THIS ISN'T THE SAME KIND OF WATER COOLING YOU SEE IN THOSE AWESOME YOUTUBE VIDEO'S. You must know that the Corsair Hydro series of water coolers are self-contained/looped units, meaning they require no real maintenance or refilling of the liquid inside. That's OK for the casual - enthusiast PC user, and even small/medium overclocks will work fine. However, large overclocks or heavy CPU loads will overpower the cooler. The reason for this is the same reason air coolers are limited: More heat is being generated than can be carried away by the coolant. As the liquid inside heats up, that heat is being directed into the fins of the radiator, and then blown away by the fan. If too much heat is present, the liquid won't cool down properly, and the system will drag hotter and hotter liquid over the CPU. The more expensive versions in the Hydro series cool better because their radiators are bigger, allowing more heat to flow out of the coolant.",12,16

Easily gained an extra 200 mhz with the liquid cooler AND maintained lower (and safe) temperatures.The smaller self-contained liquid cooling units are known more for being quiet than for their use in overclocking.For overclocking I would recommend a larger radiator/dedicated cooling solution, but this is actually capable for small overclocks.When I was stress testing @ 4.5Ghz before I hit a blue screen, I didn't break 47ºC. Which in turn leaves me with it being my cpu hitting it's design's ceiling, not the cooling. (am3/Phenom II = 60ºC max temp before failure/ruined cpu.)All overclocking aside? Just interested in a cool running and quiet system? This cooler should suit most people fine."," I have one concern for this cooler. and it is in the radiator/fan mounting.The threaded holes for the screws on the radiator, they strip VERY EASILY...(seriously..that easily)I had to move and relocate the radiator about 3 times during mounting and had to insert and remove the screws 3 times while doing so.Stripped 2 of 4  of the threaded holes on the radiator.Used a regular phillips screwdriver and did not over tighten the screws. Was very disapointed in this part of the design. What do you do if you strip all 4 screw mounts? I really did not excessively tighten these screws.It appears Corsair used aluminum in this part of the radiator for heat dissapation purposes, the threaded screw mounts could have been steel mounted into the aluminum.Or it should have/could have been a through and through thread design or solid cupped ends of the threads/screw inlet and all made from harder steel.Also, if one would want to add another fan for push-pull configuration?You have to either order the mounting screws through Corsair or find your own.Kind of a let down as it is just 4 screws that should be included, especially for something of this quality/price.And most people will/should have an extra 120mm fan left over after this install, I did..had to remove it prior to installing the Corsair fan/radiator. Would have been nice to have been able to put it to use rather than stash it with my spare parts.That would be it for the cons of this cooling unit. Mainly the radiator mounting."," For it's cooling and low noise, I have no problem with recommending this product to anyone.If someone were to consider the Corsair H60 or a high priced ""tower style"" air cooler to cool a hot running CPU? I would have to say, spend the extra $20 - $35 and go with the H60. It's performance and low noise warrants the extra money.Just have to watch out while mounting the radiator..my ONLY real gripe I have with this cooler is the radiator's mounting..It really does not take much to strip the screw holes in the radiator.And if someone were to use a drill with phillips bit to install that? would be the end of any proper mounting options for them.Lastly, I did not use the included thermal compound that was pre-applied, for which I have two reasons.One, I wanted to see the cooling block's CPU contact area for smoothness/finish.Two, I wanted to be fair vs. my air cooled setup and use the same thermal compound.The pre-applied thermal compound did appear of propper consistency and was the correct thickness applied/required.(Infact, I wanted to use it. looked grade A. Just wanted to view the copper base for it's machined quality.)-1 Egg : Installation hardware related.I would give this cooler 5 eggs....BUT...The problems of stripping screw inlets easily on the radiator, (which in turn, you strip all screw inlets, you cannot properly mount the radiator onto your case. or fans to the radiator for that matter.)

The new fan is supposed to be quieter than the one included with older H60 models, and installed in my case it is no louder than the Xigmatek Dark Knight it replaced.Small form factor, easy to install. Tubing isn't the most flexible but still fits nicely into my ATX mid-tower case and is fairly easy to install. Magnetic clip bracket is a pretty smart idea for mounting in different sockets.

The CPU I used is a hot 125W AMD Phenom x4 955 BE OC'ed to 3.8 GHz.Dark Knight idle/load: 37C/51CH60 idle/load: 33C/53CThe H60 got slightly lower idle temperatures but slightly higher load temperatures. This is disappointing considering the Dark Knight is about half of the H60's price. The H60 may perform better with cooler CPUs, but then so would cheaper air coolers.The H60 is however compatible with dual fans, something the Dark Knight can't do. This would probably lower temperatures and make the H60 a better deal, but  Corsair doesn't include the mounting hardware, which I don't understand, considering the price of this cooler. They refer you to their website to buy the screws, but would it really be that much more expensive to throw a set of 4 bolts and washers in the kit, which could potentially boost performance quite a bit?"," I think the reason this cooler doesn't deliver huge performance is it's weight. The first thing I noticed upon unboxing is how light the entire cooler assembly is. The fan, radiator and pump altogether was much, much lighter than my Xigmatek Dark Knight. In the end, I think even though the liquid works better to remove heat from the CPU, there simply isn't enough surface area on the radiator to get rid of all the heat as compared to traditional air coolers. My verdict- buy it when it's on sale or save your money and get either a high end air cooler or a more expensive proper liquid cooling system.",2,5
N82E16835181030,35-181-030,11/24/2012 11:07:24 AM,Anonymous,Impressive,5," This is the 2013 edition of a very well known and popular CPU water cooler. Among its improvements are a new quieter fan with the Max RPM's raised from 1700 to 2000.It's possible to install this cooler in 15 minutes. If you have an AMD MB with two mounting clips this more or less just pops on. Use the 4 long black screws provided and mount them through computer case, running though the fan holes and into the cooling radiator. The pump has a retention bracket with two clip holders. Just use the supplied thumb screw connectors to latch on to the CPU and tighten snugly. Do not over tighten! You could possibly crack the CPU. Then plug the 4 pin (PWM) fan cable into your MB CPU connector. Next, plug the 3 pin pump connector into any MB system fan connector (3 or 4 pin will do) and you are ready to power up.The instructions are good with separate sections for Intel or AMD mount MB's. The only confusing part is which direction to orient the fan. Corsair recommends pushing cool outside air on to radiator but I flipped mine up to pull hot air away from it. Seems to work great. Additional screws are supplied to allow you to put another fan (not supplied) to make this install a push / pull sandwiching the radiator arrangement. Also greatly appreciated  was that I did not have to remove the MB or CPU back plate to install this. The Intel brackets seem similarly involved but I did not test them.This is deathly quite. I had to verify that the pump was actually running. Since the radiator attached PWM ultra quiet fan runs at about 1000 RPM (average) on me this makes my system virtually silent. Also, since the pump is so small it has freed up two of my four memory slots on my Gigabyte 88GM-USB 3 micro-atx motherboard. This will allow me to go from 16 to 32 Gig memory using four G Skill eight gig sticks (using Windows 7 or 8 Pro Operating Systems.)"," The two hoses are very thick and a little unwieldy. You want these tubes to be strong but it does limit the mounting opportunities for the radiator/fan. Fortunately, I have a Corsair 400R case which has a top mounted grill for just such a device. And since this is a Corsair cooler they fit hand in glove for a very professional install. This should also mount fine on any other case with a 120mm or greater fan mounting slot."," I bought an AMD FX-6200 CPU a few months ago. With 6 cores and a factory clock speed of 3.8 Ghz this is by far the fastest CPU I have ever owned. However, it has been running so hot on fan based CPU coolers I have been unable to use it much at all.I do computer animation and when rendering images it was not uncommon for this CPU to heat up to 76 C before I shut it down. AMD recommends no higher than 61 C for this processor to stay within a safe operating range. Rendering maxes out all cores at 100% and these images can take from a few minutes to several hours to render, depending on scene complexity.I was shocked when I saw that this Corsair cooler idles my CPU at 14 C and maxes out at 38 C. Finally, I can get some work done with this CPU without worrying about burning down my system. This is a much more dramatic drop in temperatures than I expected.There seems to be plenty of thermal leeway to use an 8 core processor but I didn't have one to test. The 8 core AMD processors are definitely singing their siren's song for me to get one. At about $200 they seem like a steal. This 6 core was less than $150 and I now regret not spending the extra money. Still, this FX-6200 is a dream now that I can cool it.This Corsair seems like a very good buy and is targeted at power users like high-end gamers and graphics professionals who are always pushing the envelope.",3,3

The firmware update completely fixes the fan issue.------------I must say I'm really liking this H80i. CorsairLink is a very smart and handy piece of software to have. The fan levels are acceptable and it keeps my 3570K nice and cool.You must know this beforehand: Hook up the H80i with the provided CorsairLink cable and install the software (downloaded from Corsair's website). The CorsairLink software lets you take control of the entire cooling system - from the fan speed to the pump's behavior. You can even change the LED to just about any color! It's important to update the firmware because at first I was extremely disappointed with the fan noise. With the update installed, the annoying fan sounds were gone and I began tweaking the fan speed to my liking.About the cons: In the manual there's one part that mixes up the LGA 1155/1156 and LGA 2011 stand-offs. It basically refers to an image that shows which stand-off screws to use. The images are the opposite of what the text is saying. No biggie if you know what you're doing.Also, the included screws are incomplete. In the manual it'll show you there's 8x fan screws (long) and 8x screws (short) and 8x washers. From the entire box I managed to find only 4x washers and 0x short screws (but all 8x long screws, thank goodness). You can get away with the incomplete washers and lack of short screws but it's annoying nonetheless. Corsair's mistake?",12,12

Now it's just a snap of a very strong 4-corner magnet...The radiator seems to be the exact same one as used on the original H80.2nd biggest upgrade to the new H80I are the new water tubes used... MUCH more flexible and look to be abit bigger... which in theory means better circulation.Currently the H80i is only 1-3 degrees cooler then the H80 was out of the box... the real comparison will come 6-12 months from now...Will i still be using the same unit? Will it be hitting temps of 65+ in PRIME95 like my H80 now does after a year?, DONT OVER TIGHTEN YOUR SCREWS WHEN MOUNTING FANS OR MOUNTING TO CASE... YOU CAN EASILY DAMAGE YOUR FINS!!!!!!!!!!I never could figure out how to properly setup push/pull with the hardware supplied... currently i only use one extremely high powered aftermarket fan... mounted in the cases stock CPU cooler spot...not really a con but i guess some could call it one... a MASSIVE case is required to top mount these fattboy rads, my brother destroyed his new h100i from over tightening screws when mounting the rad... be careful!!!also.... do not listen to a single person who says hyperx212 or w/e its called will out perform Corsair liquid coolers... It would not surprise me if some air coolers out performed the first generation of corsair liquid coolers... These days nothing can beat the simplicity of corsairs closed loops... also... have you seen how big some of the after market air coolers are? Who would ever want to use one of those things... they are huge and are a major pain to install... LAST BUT NOT LEAST... make sure you have a large enough case... if you are buying a new case AND this at the same time i would suggest getting one of the bigger corsair towers...corsair cases equal to or bigger then carbide 500 should be able to fit h80i/h100i just fine... you will most likely only run into issues when installing the h100i as allot of mobos have 8pin power kind of in the way,0,2

Relatively quick setup.Nice light on pump (white)Very quiet on low, not too loud under full load.Seems solid, yet flexible at the same time."," The biggest issue is that the radiator stripped on 2 screws when attaching the fan/radiator to the case.  Not a big issue as the other 2 screws hold it in place, but seriously, this should not happen, especially on the first install.Missing 4 washers for the install.  I fortunately had washers here.  Secondly, the instructions are pretty lacking at best, but gives you an idea on what to do, and it is an easy install.  It's loud when it first turns on.

Ease of installation, having only watched a few videos on how to actually install the thing, I was able to complete the installation by myself in about 25-30 minutes, got everything set up with CorsairLink 2, and it runs like a charm.3. Quiet, most people complain about the fans, but they're only loud at max RPMs, you can run them at around 500RPM if you want them to be completely silent, I run mine at around 1700 and can hardly hear them.

Idle temperatures are all in the low-mid 30s. Ambient temperature is about 25 degrees Celsius. Perfect for overclocking or just simply keeping your CPU cool.-Great build quality, the tubing is 3/8ths of an inch thick, very heavy duty, but easily turned to fit even into my Antec Lanboy Air, which is slightly cramped at the moment.-Corsair Link. Great software when it works. Haven't had very many issues with it so far.All in all, this product is a great buy for someone who doesn't want to stick with air cooling, but doesn't have money for a true water cooling system. I didn't want to get something like the Noctua NH-D14, as that would just look ugly in my case. Performance is just as important as looks, and the H80i delivers in both categories."," -The radiator and two fans do take up quite a bit of space inside my mid-tower PC case. I'd suggest getting a full tower case with this product, as not only will it be less cramped, but your cable management won't suffer as much as mine has. -Fans can be loud at max RPMs, but I rarely run them there anyways.-It does, however small the possibility, have the chance to leak onto your PC components, being a liquid cooler. It hasn't done any such thing for me thus far, and I've never seen an H80i leak, although I've seen many H80s leak, but you never do know.

Will help much quicker. If it's not recognized just reinstall it.-	Fans will run 100% initially but can be cured when fans are set to balance or your preference when going into the CorsairLink software. -	Fan noise are overly exaggerated by most reviewers.-       Too quiet for me. Almost like I have to check to see if it's even working from time to time."," It's not a Corsair product con but a mobo/case combo con. -	If you have an unusually large North Bridge h/s like the one on the EVGA Classified 3 E770 combined with a SilverStone RV-01 case, it will not work installing the radiator where its normally mounted. However, easily solved by placing the radiator with p/p fan configuration to intake air in the drive bay. Make sure to properly seal around the radiator.-	FYI: Picture diagram in manual is quite misleading as the pictured fan placement exhausts air. While diagram shows air blowing in.-	If you happen to strip a screw when installing the fan don't RMA the entire cooler. Just wrap electrical tape at the end and lightly tighten.-	If you have a CorsairLink type psu you can skip the usb dongle and connect directly to the H80i/H100i (which does not mention in the manual) thus freeing up a usb connector on the mobo.The cons are minor flaws not being listed in the manual itself nor does it have instructions on how to use the CorsairLink software but if you're a tech savvy person there's nothing that you can't basically handle."," Newegg did a great job in packaging product.

I love the new tubing, a big improvement over the last generation. CorsairLink is great, I love all the options I have with the unit using the software. It uses SATA power which is much more convenient for many people because there is likely a few free SATA power connectors right beside your storage. The customizable LED is awesome. Look great in cases that already have LEDs in them."," Sigh... where do I start. When I got it, it was running very well beside the fan and pump grinding/rattling noise. So, Corsair released firmware 1.4 for the H80is and H100is... Turns out I ended up being a obviously oblivious beta tester for Corsair. 1.4 seems to brick many, many units, causing it to be undectable, kill the LED in the pump, make the fans run at 100% all the time and cause the pump to seem to not function properly. It became completely undetectable. I had to unplug 1 fan and plug the other into my motherboard and control it there because these fans are insanely loud at 100% speed (though they do push a hell of a lotta air with a lot of static pressure). Well hey, at least it fixed the grinding noise... I think I should be paid if I'm going to be a beta tester for Corsair. They took down the download link for 1.4 because of all the bricking caused from it. I followed the instructions exactly. And, instead of being payed, I had to pay over 50$ just to ship it to California from Ontario. Ridiculous. At least it motivated me to ship back my half busted Corsair Vengeance RAM as well... (would only boot in single channel mode in 5 different systems...)"," Corsair makes great products if you get a working unit. The only problem is that many of the are DOA or have problems in the near future. Luckily, because they get so many RMAs, their RMA service is great and easy to do.

The installation of this H80i was extremely easy in my Cooler Master Centurion 5 case, when first placing the cooling block on my cpu I was worried because the inlet/outlet hoses come within millimeters of my first stick of ram, but they do not touch the ram so I am ok with it.Temp Info:I took cpu temps before shuting down my system to install this and my temps at idle were 57c (too high for my liking at idle) and my peak cpu temp was 81c. After the install I let my system idle for 40 minutes, my new temp after install was 22c (that's a nice 35c drop in temp), I then stress tested and my temp at max was 37c (a 44c drop from the stock cooler)Some Negatives:I must say that the location they placed the radiator fan port was poor for an AMD user as it places the cable right above one of the thumb screws for the mounting bracket.The required SATA power is annoying to me, but you can use a Molex to SATA adapter if needed (I did not use an adapter since I have plenty of spare SATA power ports).I also found that the placement of the Motherboard fan controller connector was horribly placed by having it molded alongside the SATA power connector, I had to peal the connector farther down the cable so that I could get it to my Motherboards CPU fan port.In conclusion I'd have to say that this was one of my purchases for a CPU cooler that I have made, it does have it's annoyances but overall for the cost and performance this cooler has provided me, I cannot say it is a bad buy, in fact, I'd say it is a great buy.Previous Reviews Opinion:I gotta say I did get my doubts about purchasing this when I first read the reviews, but I like to test out things for myself. So for those of you that have or will read the other reviews, just remember that not everyone has a good experience. Some may have great experiences as I have and some may have had horror stories for you, just keep in mind that you looked at this product for a reason and make your own judgement call (of course if there were more negative reviews than positive then I would recommend heeding those warnings.)",5,5

When installed with a Sabertooth X79 motherboard the inside fan blocks 3 memory slots.  I am using Corsair Dominator Platinum so the memory coolers are high.  The memory won't fit under the inside fan.  Fan can be mounted with 1 screw and cocked so all will fit (more or less).  Fans are excessively loud if set in Balanced or Performance mode.  Fans constantly ramp up and down.  I am using an i7 3970x CPU.  The H80i barely cools it, at the cost of very, very loud fans (think shop vac here).  Even with fans at maximum it won't keep up wih the temps (non OC'ed).Software is very buggy.  Temps displayed don't come close to matching those from other utilities.

That being said, this cooler truly is high quality and performs very well. This cooler is not going to performs like a custom assembled water loop, and never will. This cooler is an entry level water solution for the CPU. It is not meant to be used by children or people with Down's syndrome (see negative reviews above.)

You don't need any washers to secure fans to this unit. The stock fans can be loud, so can any fan when set on high. Get over it, or use aftermarket fans like smart people do.

(I haven't had any of those problems and mine came with the latest firmware) I overclocked the CPU a little, right now I'm running at 4.33 ghz(had it at the 4.58ghz also) on a 3570k I-5 using the Gygabyte easytune6 utlity of my MB and I have a cpu temp of 26c at pretty much idle(light use). Corsair link software let's you keep track of your H80i's pump speed, 2 fans speed,my 2 video cards fan speed and your CPU's temp and load %, and your HD's temp. The led color change options of the water block are also pretty cool.", Price=100+ bucks for a CPU cooler for someone on a pc budget is a little high. Had a 200mm fan at the top of my case and had to remove it and replace with a 120mm so the H80i would install on the inside of my HAF912+. It's a little scary having a heavy water block dangling over my sensitive Motherboard/CPU/Ram while installing this(be careful and take your time). You don't know which HD is which in the Corsair link software that monitors it's temp(not a big deal)one of the HD's shows 0(maybe it's my SSD)., A few people have bagged on the fan orientation that Corsair recommends(intake). If you read some(professional) reviews of the H80i you will find that this actually WILL give you a lower temp.,3,4

( i use headphones when i game) i dont hear any grinding or even any loud ""im gona die soon"" pump sounds.  all in all its a good machine and i am happy with it. It droped my computer to about 6.6c at idel and i have never touched 30c yet.

9SIA85V4NG1052,35-181-031,1/1/2013 11:55:22 PM,Anonymous,Abandon ship!!,2," I actually need to get this out of the way first and foremost. My unit probably could qualify for an RMA but I'm not wasting my time and money on something I can deal with myself.The cooler is good. Actually, it's great. In the state it's in, I'm getting 4 degrees above ambient at idle, 8 degrees above ambient in a game and 25 degrees above ambient at 100% load on a 3570k (bear in mind the bad IHS issues). It's great and it works. Why the 2-egg review? Well..."," I had to make this thing work by myself. And it took a few things I would never do on someone else's computer because I still don't know about this. See other thoughts for a bit of background into the whole H80 vs H80i story. It's quite good if you want to know and does help explain why this product is so bad.So, the cons. Where to begin? A good all-in-one liquid cooler needs a pump, a radiator and maybe even a built-in fan controller. That's it. That's what the H80 was. And it was great. Except for the bearing. And maybe a few other little things because the H80i has a few degrees of thermal improvement.That's where the improvements end. The H80i wants you to use software to control it. That is sort of okay. You get to control the fans yourself from software. Before, you could still control the fan speed via the motherboard. Now the whole thing is powered by a SATA power cable and the pump sends an RPM signal (that's it. Only one of the four pins) to the CPU header just so the motherboard doesn't have a fit (CPU fan error if it isn't getting an RPM signal). The fan speed is now controlled by the pump. There is absolutely no way to control the fans without Corsair Link.And this is bad because Corsair Link is BAD. BAD BAD BAD. The pump connects to the motherboard using one of the internal USB 2.0 headers and this is bad because it chews up two front panel USB jacks if you don't have spares on your motherboard. Your CPU cooler SHOULD NOT need two USB 2.0 worth of bandwidth. That is just stupid. Worse yet is that the firmware on the H80i units that are being shipped out as this point in time have a problem where the PWM frequency is wrong (Corsair said this, not me) and the fans make a grinding noise.Okay. First of all the fans don't even use PWM. They're 3-pin. Second, why does a fan controller need firmware? Third, how can your firmware be so badly written it messes with hardware that just spins around in a circle all day?Worse yet is updating the firmware is hit-and-miss. In my case, Corsair Link only sort of knew there was an H80i somewhere but it refused to offer the H80i as an option for updating firmware. This was actually probably for the best since updating the firmware can actually kill your unit if you get tails instead of heads. Corsair recommends downgrading to version 2.1.1 of Corsair link instead of 2.2 to improve your odds with the firmware update.This must seem like a big rant but here's the big picture. Corsair's quality control approved hardware that causes fans to make a grinding noise, somehow. Better yet they release software updates that THEY THEMSELVES don't recommend you to use. This is something from a sitcom where everything the character does digs himself a deeper grave. They release faulty hardware. They release firmware that can brick your unit. The release software to try to fix the firmware updating issues but actually makes things worse.It's this kind of thing I don't put up with and"," For this build, I was originally planning to use the H100. I eventually decided on the H80 instead so I could keep the 3x120mm rad space available if I decided to go for custom water cooling some day. This is a HAF 932 Advanced, by the way. I was looking up the pump grinding issue that seemed to plague everyone and I eventually bumped into what I thought was absolutely wonderful from Corsair. One of the guys with his own office and who probably wears a suit more expensive than my car was following the complaints thread very carefully and took it upon himself to resolve the pump issues and keep everyone aware of what was going on. He noticed the RMA rate doubling and a good number of people asking for RMAs again and again (the people who insist on the RMA even if the noise was barely audible if you stuck your ear on the pump).Corsair eventually found out there was an error in the tolerance for part of the ceramic bearing in the pump. Part of it was the manufacturer not meeting the design tolerance and the other part was Corsair themselves being too generous with the tolerance. Out of nowhere pop the H80i and H100i with a few other tweaks. You can tell they rushed the H80i and H100i when they found out they had to redesign the bearings anyway because the rest of the unit seems really rushed.A lot of people are resorting to manual control of the fans and using a motherboard header. I'm using ASUS AI Suite II for that. Fan Xpert works well except for one problem. You have 0 control over a CPU fan if it doesn't have four pins. The included ones are 3-pin as a way to force you to use the pump controller I guess?I've got the pump RPM signal in the CPU fan header just to keep the motherboard from throwing a CPU fan error. I've got the two fans plugged into one of the chassis fan headers (with a splitter) and this allows me to control them. Plugging them into the CPU fan header just gets you the world's two loudest fans going at 100% since you can't control them without the PWM.Corsair should stick to power supplies. I've had bad RAM but maybe that was unlucky. The Hydro Series was some awesome unworldly alien tech that allowed the upper middle-class of computer enthusiasts to get liquid cooling for under 100 bucks. It was great. Corsair should have made a good product (they got that right), start selling it like hotcakes and make millions (they got that right too) and then sell the rights to someone else at the peak of sales (they messed this one up). Now, everyone and their dog is making a competitor to the Hydro Series and Corsair is just another name in the CLC market. With the way they're handling their issues, they Quality Control is going to lose them a lot of money before this is all over...",10,15
9SIA85V4NG1052,35-181-031,12/30/2012 10:19:03 PM,Nevon T.,"Great hardware, poor software, poor customer support",3," - Inexpensive after discount, coupon code and MIR.- Light compared to huge air cooler it replaced.- SATA connection for the pump- ease of install, much better that the old method where it was bolts, then a ring, then the pump had to twist to lock in place- Unit can be mounted without removing the motherboard provided you have a CPU cutout.- Quiet pump, no leaks so far.- Nice thick tubes which makes it stand out from the competition that still use the standard slimmer tubes. - thick radiator to disperse heat. When i ran the torture test i could really feel the heat exhausting out the back of my case."," Most of my cons relate to the software that control this hardware.- missing hardware, what you see in the picture on Newegg is what you get. If your going by the instructions you will not receive 8 washers, only 4. You will not receive 4 short screws, only 8 long ones for push pull. There is also a mix up in the manual with the 2011 and 1155 screws.- Unable to differentiate which hard drive temp corresponds to which drive. It just labels them Drive Temp 1, 2, 3, etc. - No way to tell which fan relates to what meter. I had to manually crank the fans up while looking in the case to see what fan RPM changed.- The device icons do not resize when you resize the Corsair Link application, leaving everything jumbled up together.- After i set everything up and rebooted all my devices were relocated to the top right corner of the application right on top of each other other so i had to put them all back in the corresponding location in the case image.- When connected to the waterblock the fans are noisy on any mode except ""Quiet"" but when set to quiet they emit a high pitch wine. When connected to the motherboard the fans are still noisy on anything other that 6.5v ""1200 RPM"". - The included fans are 3-pin fans. Considering the cost of this product it amazes me that the lower cost revised H60 includes a 4-pin PWM fan of this same design.- Corsair link cannot fully control fans made by other manufactures. When i connected my 4 pin Cougar fans it was either Quiet mode or full speed, nothing in between. This caused me to yank the fans from the block get a PWM splitter and connect them to my motherboard CPU PWM header. Much better control.- If you install their software it will create a process ""Sierra 2.exe"" that access your hard drives every 3 seconds."," First, before anything i updated the firmware of the H80i to the latest. Despite the missing hardware i managed to acquire an alternative cable form a friend to connect the fans to the CPU block. They also did not receive all 8 washers or the 4 short screws with their unit.- This was mounted in a HAF 912 Advanced and is my first water cooling unit. I swapped out my 9900LED which have more than proven itself since when i first installed it on my Q6600 in 2008. I decided to go this route because i was tired of rattling sound it made at 35% PWM and cleaning it out with compressed air was a pain, not to mention the proprietary fan that i could not remove and the discoloration of the copper over the years. - I mounted this on a Q6600 processor on a 775 board. YES, you can mount this on a 775 board but there is a catch. First you must have a 775 backplate as the included one will not fit. I used my old 775 backplate and the 1155 mounting screws fit perfectly. Second, make sure that there is clearance for the capacitors at the top of the board. The CPU block hit my capacitors on my IP35Pro motherboard causing the it to bend when tightening the screws. I did not fully tighten.- Corsair recommends to mount the unit pulling air into the case, which does provides an additional 2C drop in temps but since my case have a honeycomb cut out in the rear like most cases there was air noise when the fan is set to intake. Changing it to exhaust and no more air noise. - The included thermal paste is ok if you want ease of install, but after testing temps with the included paste i cleaned it off and remounted the block with A5 N82E16835100007, temps dropped another 5c.- I also swapped out the stock fans for 2 Cougar PWM fans N82E16835553006, much quieter and cools just a well.When it was all said and done, i set the LED color then set the application not to start up, it was a great gimmick that the color of the LED block can change with the temp but when the software cannot do much more it becomes useless. I left the fan controls up to my motherboard, which did a way better job, monitoring temps (Abit uGURU is king!), fan speeds and to shutdown the system if the pump stops or the CPU temp goes over 65. I would not trust Corsair link to shutdown my system with their buggy software if something went wrong such as the application locking up or crashes.In the end i moved the entire unit to my new build. Storm Shout II, Gigabyte UD5H, Kingston Hyper X 16GB 1300, Intel 3770K, @4GHz running at 17c idle and 	never went over 50c with Prime95 max heat test running for 8 hours.I contacted Corsair about the missing hardware since 12/5/2012 using their Tech Support Express, within 24 hours i received a response and i supplied my shipping information for the missing hardware all on the same day. The ticket sat there for more than a week until i called them on the 12/17/2012. Tomorrow will be 1/1/2013 and i have yet to receive the missing hardware d",17,19

9SIA85V4NG1052,35-181-031,12/20/2012 9:43:58 PM,Will C.,Definitely Worth Every Penny,5," The Corsair H80i has really impressed me in terms of quality and ease of installation/operation. I purchased this unit to accommodate an FX-8350 CPU, which I figured would be a bit of a hot potato, but so far the H80i has kept the temps at a cool 16C idle and 34C load. The pre-applied thermal compound on the pump is nicely doing its job, and I only have the fans set to ""balanced"" speed, which is just a hiss above whisper and much quieter than any of the air coolers I've owned in the past. And the installation is a breeze. All you really need is a screwdriver. Just mount the radiator, mount the pump, and connect the cables. Easily done with one person in 10 minutes, for the AMD installation anyway.Oh and did I mention the Corsair Link software? It's free of charge from the H80i's product page on Corsair's website, and it literally allows me to control everything this cooling system does. It gives me settings for fan and pump speeds, along with a display for CPU and GPU temps. And from there I can change the color of the Corsair logo on the pump, which is very nice looking if you have a window on your side panel."," A bit bulky with the push-pull fan configuration, be sure you have enough room in your case to mount it. Cables going everywhere! I didn't expect a water cooling unit to have so many cable connections, and they'll be quite unorganized unless you take the time to deal with them."," I see some people reporting high pitched noises from the fans, and firmware problems, though I did not experience neither. Just be sure to get the Corsair Link software, as that allows you to adjust pretty much everything. And the Corsair Link software has the function to update the H80i's firmware, no flashing needed.",3,3

Faulty firmware that cannot be backed up or reflashed, a horrible software that does not even work or do what its intended to do.The problem is the common grinding and buzzing. The fans set themselves really high, the pump tries to kill itself, and then the whole unit disconnects itself from the computer, so you cant change a thing. The solution? RMA it until one works.

Nothing on fans to indicate air flow., This review is to correct my earlier review I made a noob mistake and mounted both fans blowing towards each other. I recommend mounting the fans so they blow out of the case if mounting in the rear exhaust fan position I achieved better cooling this way the instructions tell you to mount them blowing into the case. And also zip tie your stock CPU cooling fan to the hoses so it points towards the NB/MOSFET area of the mother board.

Before purchasing the bundle i spoke with newegg tech on upgrading the cooler to a h100i and pay the difference since the h80i is rather weak for said cpu. They said I could not.. Needless to say I bought it anyway thinking it cant be that bad. Well it is..  On the box its not even recomended for any FX series processor, let alone a processor with a 219TDP. Just running the cpu at its stock clock and prime95 you can watch your temps just rise to near unsafe levels.

Idle temps are 29°C, and most high performance temps never reach above 56°-58°C-The center bracket has a nice LED light on the top and it can be changed to any color to match cases or fans, it can also be set to off.-The user interface on the software provided is easy to understand and has a nice feature of being able to apply a background picture of your actual machine in which you can have your settings displayed over. Or if you rather a picture of cute, cuddly kittens."," To really keep this thing clean and up-kept you have to take it off its mount on the case and remove the fans entirely each time. Since the mount bracket on the CPU side is such a bugger to get fastened in correctly in the first place, I choose to not remove that part unless to re-apply thermal paste. The con here is that it is a time sink and you have to commit to keeping it clean, for someone with OCD no problems here but for those who rarely give their cases a crack open you may find the dust will soon take over the slats in the center housing."," - It would be nice to see lights come to later models, or maybe a bit of color choice on the main housing. The center light on the CPU bracket has a cool light function and provides an infinite array of colors it would be nice to that applied to other parts of the units, most notably the fans.",2,2

This cooler works very well, and although it is dual fanned with pump, is relatively quiet.  Simple enough maintenance, and definitive upgrades from the previous model.  Functionality is great."," HOWEVER, for some reason (I still can't fathom why), they decided to make the pump attach to the motherboard with an overhead USB connection. WHY?!?!?!  This is the one downgrade from previous versions/other models, and literally makes no sense. Now I have to locate a splitter (if they make them), or lose half of my usb ports. With all of the other usable connections, and the minimal usb connections (all computers I have seen have two), why the heck would you take up one of those?

See the full review ""Cool and Loud""", The case fans used to cool the radiator are VERY loud.," I promised a follow-up. So here it is:After replacing the stock case fans with ARCTIC F12 PWM [Newegg item # N82E16835186033] the system is much quieter.  For this reason, I added one egg back. It is possible to get decent cooling without all the extra noise.  As a bonus, my maximum temperatures [overclocked and nearly 100% capacity] dropped from 57°C to 51°C.

The stock fan worked okay until I put it under a heavy load.  I was a little nervous about the temperatures rising above 75°C.  When overclocking the system was shut down on temperature.With the H 80i installed I can run a full load [all eight cores at 100%] for hours and still not go above 57°C.  This is after overclocking from 4.1 to 4.6 GHz.  Idle temperatures are also lower.  If you are encoding heavy graphics and need to control the temperature of your CPU, then this cooler will do the job."," The case fans are very loud; just a little quieter than a handheld vacuum. I'm not kidding!  It is really annoying.The Corsair software is designed to control your fan speeds.  I dropped the fan speeds from 2500RPM to 1250 RPM.  The noise went from extremely loud to very loud.  This is not much of an improvement.  The lower speed to not affect the cooling capacity.  This makes sense if you have a background in HVAC.  Higher velocity air over the heat exchanger is not necessarily helpful.  It can actually reduce heat transfer.My solution was to order to quiet [ ARCTIC F12 PWM ]120 mm case fans [Newegg item # N82E16835186033]  I'll let you know the results after I have them installed.Another big con is the fact that you have to give up one of your USB2 connectors on the motherboard to power the circulating pump in the cooler.  This was a big pain for me because I am using both USB2 connectors.  I have one spare USB3 connector left my motherboard.  My solution was to order a USB3 to USB2 connector from frozen CPU.com [item number cab-630]. The case fans were about $20 shipped and the connector was about $10 shipped.  The motherboard is an Asus Sabertooth FX 90 rev 2.  If this is your setup, then plan on spending an additional $30 for a quieter CPU cooler that you can actually plug into your motherboard."," I suggest you take your time installing the cooler. Don't get in a hurry or you will have to take it back off and install it again.The fans are designed to pull air in from the outside, so look at the side of the fans. There is a small arrow in the black plastic show you the direction of the airflow.You will probably use your rear vent to mount the CPU cooler. If you have a case fan there, then you can move it to another vent.  Be sure the hoses are in a downward position towards the motherboard. I don't suggest you mount the radiator in the top of your case.  If there is any error in the system, then you may not get the proper circulation for your pump.I gave this three eggs. -1 egg for the fans which are loud as h**l  and -1 egg for the fact that that you have to give up one of your USB connectors on your motherboard.

Corsair Link software is super picky and buggy causing BSOD's on install.  My machine had MIcrosoft Certification Toolkit installed which caused the Corsair Link software to generate a BSOD on SysTrace.sys during install.  Several reboots/failed installs later and a windows repair; I got it figured out and had to uninstall the MS Cert Toolkit then manually delete the SysTrace.sys file then reboot again.  All this to get the Corsair Link software to install without crashing my machine.  Cooler wasn't working very well so I wanted to get some diagnostic info from their software and/or update firmware.  Diagnostic info was less then helpful then the pump or pump controller failed so now I am waiting on an RMA on this 1 month old cooler.I do not like that I have to install such a picky app to do a firmware update or get diagnostic info.   I'd rather just not have a USB interface and have the device be more reliable.," I really liked the older H50s but if this is any indication of how the future quality/reliability is going to be, I will be looking elsewhere.I picked up some different fans to deal with the noise issue (expensive Noctua NF-12's) but that REALLY shouldn't be needed...One of the biggest reasons to go with water cooling is noise reduction IMO...I'm outside of 30 days from purchase date (by 6) so I'm waiting on Corsair's RMA process.

I'm using one on my i7-4770K and it's doing a great job keeping temperatures under 50 no matter what I'm doing., None so far.," Someone commented about the metal being ""too soft"" and striping the holes.  Really, when someone goes on like that about something that : ANY HOLE WILL STRIP FOR A WHOLE VARIETY OF REASONS.  And I apologize to the gentleman himself but people really make this more complicated than it ought to be and complain about features in reviews the mfg never claims the product has or is supposed to do.  Like any screw don't over-tighten, but I was able to tighten mine down pretty tight with two fans mounted.  Bottom line, go to review sites, go to corsair's site.  The unit does everything it claims to if installed properly, which care is required, but it's easier to mount than most high end air coolers.  I think if we all put our minds to it we should be capable of not stripping the screws.  If it happens, that  would suck, but man up, order a new mounting kit or if the hole itself is stripped well you ruined you're water cooler.  And another complaint was ""expensive"".  $80 for a complete, no maintenance liquid cooler, expecting anything more is asking for a cheap product and just flat out unreasonable.  You pay $200 - $1000 for the CPU and want to overclock, $80 is very reasonable and 5 - 10 years ago we all would have been willing to fork over $300 for something like this.

I wanted the supposed great performance, but I was worried about things like a broken pump, leaks, and noise.However, so far, my experience with this product has been fantastic.  Not only has it kept my i7 4770k super cold at 4.5ghz, but it has done so (relatively) quietly.  Also, the entire assembly is very sturdy, and I don't think I need to ever worry about it leaking.  Obviously I haven't been able to test this thing for years, but so far I am feeling much, much more confident in its performance and reliability.Also, something to note, the radiator+2fan assembly is THICK.  Super-duper thick.  If you want a thin rad, look at the H90.  This one, however, performs better than the tamer H90 (I've used both).Plus, there's plenty of room for my very-high-profile RAM.And, as I use the rad as an exhaust, it doesn't blow hot air into the case like an air cooler does, keeping the rest of the components, like the GPU and drives, cooler.Overall, very satisfied with the excellent performance of this cooler.

Seems to do a good job of cooling *if* mounted properly."," The radiator is constructed of very soft metal (aluminum i think). The way the H80i is supposed to be mounted to the case is by screwing through the outside of the case then through one of the corsair supplied cooling fans, then screwing it into the radiator itself. This puts a fair amount of stress on the screws and the radiator where they are attached to. Consequently, it's possible to strip the threads on the radiator. Once this happens its impossible to securely mount/tighten the radiator unit to the case.  This *is* a known common problem with this model (Google ""Corsair H80i radiator screws"" or just look at some of the negative posts on NewEgg). Simply put, the radiator case material is too soft to thread directly into. I succeeded in stripping two of the imbedded threads on radiator because of this poor design. The only recourse I have is to try to find two screws that are slightly fatter and rethread the hole in the radiator, or return the whole thing to NewEgg. I will choose the latter as I don't see why the consumer has to pay for poorly designed product. Another problem has to do with the manual. If you follow the steps outlined in the manual, it has you mounting the fans to the radiator, then the radiator to the case before mounting the cooler to the CPU.  With all cpu's except socket 2011 you have to mount a backplate on the other side of the mobo, so unless you can get at the motherboard from the backside without having to remove it from the case, you will have to unmount the radiator so you can remove the mobo and install the back-plate.  Another niggle, every review I've seen states that Corsairs parts list is incorrect, as they only ship four fan washers, when you have two fans and need 8, which they claim they include. This is a minor thing as the washers aren't necessary, and easy to find at any hardware store if you want washers on every fan screw. Really, this unit had the potential of being a winner, but because of the poor design should be avoided. And, for people stating they had no problems with installation I can only say, your lucky, but don't feel *too* lucky as sooner or later the stress caused by the weight of the radiator will cause the screw threads to weaken over time and fail.",,0,1

Did some more benchmarking on a more typical summer day (~96 F outside, 80s inside) and max temp hit 62C which is about right with the ambient temps and the fans were slightly humming at around 1600 RPMs. The hardware side of the H80i is pretty sound but..."," The software, now that I've used it a lot more, is so incredibly buggy. You'll have the icons from your saved profile show up as all zeros and have a brand new set of the SAME icons working properly but not placed. It makes no sense. Sometimes changing the fan speeds in CorsairLink doesn't do anything or takes a while for it to register. Changing to the BETA version of the software didn't do anything."," My revised final thoughts on this are:If you don't mind the software(which is pretty bad, considering how big of a corporation Corsair is) it's a great functioning cooler. The pro reviews have this as one of the best CPU closed-loop coolers out there and it performs like it. With the way it's designed you won't see much cooling on the idle side but you'll see it in the max side. I still recommend it but if you can find something else comparable in the price range of this ($86) you might want to give it a shot because these software issues have been around for a while and it doesn't look like Corsair is going to fix them anytime soon.

9SIA85V4NG1052,35-181-031,6/4/2013 11:47:29 PM,Anonymous,Nice,4," Not a bad AIO closed-loop liquid cooling system. Even though it feels very lightweight, it seems to be very well constructed. Especially the water block itself. This is almost the same thing as the older Corsair H80. However they have completely changed out the tubing running from the water block to the radiator. It is thicker and way more flexable. The thickness of the tubing, partnered with the thicker radiator, increase the cooling performance of this unit by more than you would expect. Very easy to install, at least on an AMD socket AM3+. Uses a nice magnetic bracket and two metal looped retention clips with bolts that you just have to fix to the stock bracket. Intel sockets seem to look more complicated. Pre-applied thermal paste seems to work well, however I removed the water block after testing it and used Arctic Silver 5 instead. Increased cooling performance even more.The two included fans are pretty nice, not cheaply made or anything. They can run from 900 - 2500 rpm. Depending on what type of profile you set up with the Corsair Link software. Software is pretty simple to setup and run. Gives you a lot of options depending on your cooling and case accent needs. Color changing Corsair logo on the water block can be set to any color of the rainbow. Also white (default) or black (off). Even has color shift effects such as: pulsating, temperature color change, and shift between 2 or 4 colors. Pretty neat if you have a window on your side panel.Easily removable if you need to swap out CPUs or reapply thermal paste. Compared to other brands, this is a major plus in my book. I have two other coolers that almost break when you try to swap them out. Very easy to assemble out of the box. Took about 10-15 minutes to install in my full tower. Mid towers might be more difficult though."," This is the second unit that I bought. On the first one the screw holes were stripped out on the back of the radiator. The stock screws would just spin in it. I had to use some screws that I had laying around that were thicker to make them bite. After a while I got it in and stable. The second one I purchased had no problems at all. Installed without incident. Guess the first one was just a glitch. Minus one egg there.Radiator fins are also very fragile. With the first cooler I installed it without the front (push) fan installed. I pinned it to the back of the case with my fingers while trying to install the screws, bending some of the fins on the front of the radiator. With the second one I installed the front fan first, so that I didn't repeat this mistake again. Radiator does feel kind of cheap compared to the water block. It's so lightweight it doesn't even feel like there is any liquid in it. But there is, trust me.Software has some major issues. When you close the window it always pops up the ""save profile"" prompt. Sometimes system stats disappear from the UI, and the logo goes black. Even resetting the system does not fix this. You have to completely shut the system for everything to reappear. Also when the software is running during shutdown, it lags the shutdown/restart process. Windows pops a prompt up asking if you want to force a shutdown. Very annoying."," Overall very nice cooler. I was looking for something to replace my TT water 2.0 Performer. My overclocked AMD Phenom II x4 960t was running on par with temps I can get with an older air cooler. So I researched the situation and found out that the radiator on that unit is known to not be able to cool highly overclocked CPUs very well. It's just not thick enough. I found these things and thought since they had thicker radiators/tubing that they would be able to move more liquid, and thus, cool better. Both of the units that I have are able to cool my CPUs way better than anything else I have tried to use. My temps before were: AMD Phenom II x4 960t Black Edition - Unlocked to x6 overclocked from 3 GHz to 3.7-3.8 GHz running at 100%.TT water 2.0 Performer - 55C to 63C peakNow they are:Same CPU running at 100%Corsair Hydro H80i - 36C to 43C peak.So as you can see it is a big improvement over what I was previously using for cooling. I noticed that others were complaining about a high pitch whine or weird noise when the fans were running at higher speeds. I think I have narrowed down the culprit. The included fans have 4 little piped holes on the sides. I don't know the function of these holes, maybe for silent operation or even better cooling performance, but they seem to be making a slight whine when running the fans at over 70 percent. I heard a strange sound after installing one of these coolers in my test bed. So I switched out the fans and the noise went away. You can purchase other better fans from newegg or corsair to replace these stock ones. I really don't see the point, but it's nice to know that if one dies you can.After all the trouble the first H80i I received gave me, I am still very happy with the purchase. The second one redeemed my trust in the Corsair brand name once again. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for excellent after market cooling performance for not that hefty of a price tag.",2,4

Unless you have loud speakers or headphones, the racket they make can be very distracting.- Mediocre cooling performance in my experience.

I was excited about the cooler, but despite multiple mounting attempts, I was never able to achieve good performance with it. In addition, the annoying whining sound and loud fans were enough to send me looking elsewhere. I decided to try a Thermalright True Spirit 140. It is much cheaper, narrow enough to avoid overlapping my RAM slots, and keeps my temps lower (mid-high 70s during IBT) than the H80i. The True Spirit 140 is also MUCH quieter than the H80i under load. The fans are also a bit quieter at idle, and there is no whining sound - this drove me CRAZY with the H80i.Given the great reviews the H80i has received, it is possible I simply had a bad unit.

Closed circuit so you don't have to worry about purchasing and spilling coolant on your MB. Quieter that an aftermarket air cooler while producing the same results as high end air coolers. Working on a Core i7 3770k OC to 4.8Ghz running 33C at idle and 58C at full load.," The radiator screw holes are thin. Be very very careful not to over-tighten on your first installation like myself, and many others like me have done. It is not an issue for me now that I have installed many of these units so I did not deduct a star. Just know, don't over tighten!"," Play with your case placement and fan directions. I was able to drop my ambient temperature by 5+ degrees (C) just by reversing some of my case fans and changing the way that the air was intake and exhausted. Ideally, you want the radiator fan(s) to be placed somewhere where it is drawing fresh air from outside the case but only experimenting will get better results.",None,None

Temps were consistently in the high 80s under load (prime95), some cores spiking to 90+ degrees.  Corsair RMA'd that one for an H 80i.  Processor is now in the high 60s.  This cooler outperforms the H 90 by ~20 degrees.  Compared to the H 90, the pump is MUCH easier to seat/install.You can download the Corsair software which allows you to control fan speeds via your OS.  Pump also has a color changing LED that will change colors based upon the temp of your processor or the temp of the pump.  You set the temp thresholds and pick the colors.  This allows you to look into your case and know at a glance if your processor is running hot.Comes with two 120 mm fans for a push/pull config.  Both fans appear to be very sturdy and will ramp up to around 2800 RPM at max."," Noise level.  It doesn't make any difference to me, but when the fans ramp up to a higher RPM, you are definitely going to hear them.  In my case, I don't care so long as they are doing the job.  The thermal paste that's pre-applied is garbage.  Clean it off with some 91% alcohol and get a good after-market paste.On my unit, the fan control cable was bad.  Luckily a buddy had a spare, but if he hadn't, I'd have been out of luck.  Also the ports where the control cables plug into are flimsy.  If you aren't careful, you'll rip the housing right out of the port."," Compared to the H 90 (which is more expensive), this unit is awesome.  Much more efficient at cooling the CPU and I really like the ability to control the pump and fans from within the software, which I couldn't do with the H 90.My buddy has the H 100i and I think the 80i actually outperforms that unit too.  For the money, you can't beat this unit.If you are one of those folks who has built their own customized water cooling system, this unit isn't going to impress you, but if you are looking for a self-contained hydro cooler, you can't do much better than this one in my opinion.",1,1

I'm using the fans on silence mode and ruing prime5 will not go higher than 52c', It can be noise if operated at high speeds. Therefore is ok just to keep it running in slow speed. it will create a annoying noise if  operating above silence mode.

If you don't, you will have to uninstall MoBo as the installation of the CPU cooler requires a metal support bracket to be placed underneath the CPU! (Shouldn't be a problem if you have a well-designed case)- My biggest complaint is that I can be fairly hard to attach the fan/radiator assembly to the back of the case, especially if you are working alone. They do not make it easy to line up the holes so that you can place the screws while using one hand to hold the entire assembly together; I needed a friend to help me with me with the installation this component. Perhaps if they made a snap on feature for the fans and the radiator so they stay together, then it would be a lot easier to hold on to it.- Otherwise, I saw my temps go from baseline 49*C to 30-32*C on average, and my max temps (when on full load) went down from 95-98*c to 70*C tops, So a 15-20*C drop after installation!- The CorsairLink Software allows for customization of fan speeds either by setting modes (quiet, Max, Performance, Custom) or you can set a fixed RPM speed or Fixed on % of Max speed. This is perfect if you want to balance speed/cooling of fan with the amount of sound generated.- You can also customize a LED light that is located directly on the CPU cooler component (If you see the white Corsair ship logo on pictures on the product page, that's what changes color). You can set a base color that stays the same, or have the colors change based on the temp of the CPU (If you set a range, it changes as the CPU gets hotter and cooler).- Tip: I would make sure to use a different cooling paste than the thermal pad that is included on the cpu cooler; personally, I used Arctic Silver 5 after I used the Arcticlean Remover solutions (both products work great!) on the pad itself.TL;DROverall, AWESOME self-enclosed water cooling system, I had a drop of 15-20*C on average once installed, maybe hard to install yourself, Software allows for customization of Fan speeds and LED light, maybe switch out thermal paste for your own flavor.

Depending on your method of thermal paste application it still may be loose after cure of paste....check after an hour of use to make sure you have a proper seat and for you intel guys please double check proper seating of the back plate, you do not want a loose back plate on install. Once the back plate is mated and pump is mounted you should no movement and that does not mean apply alot of force to move anything please. just grab the pump or back plate n gently try to move it n see if there loose...this unit is getting a bad name cause some people may be overlooking simple details. If your back plate is lose I recommend that you use nylon #8 washer at lowes you may need smaller ones. The washers will be put on the studs of the back plate so when you mount it the plate will be seating tight against the board, then you may proceed to mount the pump.", Overall this unit is able to handle a good amount of overclocking and take up less space. you can mod it with the purchase of aftermarket fans with a higher positive pressure output than stock.

What I mean is; if you put the rear fan on the inside of the case, the tube length might be a bit long which causes the pump mount to turn while trying to position correctly. I moved the rear fan to the outside of the case and the extra 1/2"" made a big difference.These can get loud. It shouldn't be a problem unless your sound system stinks or you live at home w/ the parents. I think I will be looking for another pair of fans to take over.

My main complaint with the product is that under load and heavy gaming loads 40C+ the fans are loud.  So loud I can hear the hum over the game music and sounds.  It does get annoying and has caused me to rethink my case options and possibly opt for putting it into a sound damped case. Also thought about changing out the push pull fans to Noctua's just to see if it will help keep the noise down. 2.  Corsair Customer Support is horrible.  I never thought Corsair would have such pathetic support because of its reputation, I was wrong.  I've had the H80i for almost 3 weeks and it has been that long for me waiting for Corsair to respond to my support ticket about the noise.  I have updated my ticket twice and it seems like their ""online"" chat support is never on.  3.  Like other Hydro series owners have stated one of the radiators screw holes was already stripped and I could not get a solid hold on one corner of my pull fan to the rear of the case.  I have secured it solid enough to rear of the case that it does not contribute to fan noise.  4.  Tough to fit in smaller cases (currently in BitFenix Prodigy)  This is due to the hoses being so thick and tight its hard to bend them out of the way. 5.

It's definitely good looking in a windowed case with lighting, etc. Compared to a hulking heatsink its flatout gorgeous.The new CorsairLink beta release worked pretty much fine on Windows 8.1 for me.For some people, I'm sure installation of this puppy is an absolute snap."," The mounting system is probably the biggest problem across the board from my POV. It's simple and easy for the most part, but it isn't very effective. The hoses may place side pressure on the block which, in my case was unavoidable and on the first mounting attempt (which oddly gave the best temperatures I ever managed with the unit I received) only half of the CPU cover was touched by the pre applied thermal grease. The rest of the CPU was bare even though I used a screwdriver to tighten the screws. Things went OK for about a day as I decided to just live with the slightly higher heat after several reseating attempts (switched from Noctua NH-C14 which is not an easy HS to install so I'm no idiot). The backplate seems designed just fine but the standoffs are not very confident on a z87 Hero. After the initial disappointment with performance I decided to change the fans since the ones provided sound terrible at anything other than minimum speed, in my opinion. This turned out to maybe save my system because I found the unit was leaking slowly from one of the hoses after removing it completely. The leak somehow miraculously avoided damaging any components but a good 3 inch long streak which had spread into several tributaries of powdery coolant residue was evident around and below the onboard sound connectors. It ended right above the first PCIEx16 slot. How nothing was damaged is absolutely inexplicable to me. I cleaned the motherboard for about an hour with a microfiber cloth and isopropyl alcohol but there are a few white spots here and there still. I put the Noctua back on and sent the vile thing back. Very pretty package. Could cost you a lot more than you bargained for. I saw a guarantee against component damage but it looked like it was labeled specifically for Australian consumers. Anyway, definitely don't just blindly assume your install or your unit was flawless with these simple things. Leak test."," Every time I try something Corsair it doesn't go well.

The fans that are included are top notch, and even when running at almost full speed or in ""performance mode,"" the unit is very muted.  Not silent, but very quiet relative to the amount of air the two fans are moving and the rpms they are spinning at.  The management software that you download is pretty nice as well, allowing you to manually tweak your cooling profiles, use preset cooling profiles, and monitor your system.  Also, it is less bulky and takes up less space than most comparably performing air-cooling solutions.  I was using this cooler to cool a Haswell 4770k.  At idle, my processor was running at ambient room temperature.  You can't get any better than that unless you're using an exotic liquid nitrogen cooling solution.  Under normal usage, temperatures were at mid-40's Celsius.  Stress-testing with an AVX enabled LinPack put temperatures in the high-50"," I bought this cooler for to replace a CoolerMaster Hyper-212+ I had recycled from my previous build.  The processor I am running on my new build is a Haswell 4770k.  I wanted to overclock my 4770k more aggressively than I was able using my CoolerMaster Hyper-212+ set up in a similar push-pull configuration.  The performance is comparable to, but not better than, the CoolerMaster, which is a $30 part ($40 if you include the purchase of the second fan).The performance difference is best illustrated by comparing temperatures. At idle, the Corsair Hydro keeps the 4770k at 22-25 Celsius (ambient temperature).At idle, the Cooler Master 212+ keeps the 4770k at 28-32 Celsius (a few degrees above ambient temperature).Under normal usage, the Corsair Hydro keeps the 4770k at 36-42 Celsius.Under normal usage, the Cooler Master 212+ keeps the 4770k at 38-44 Celsius.At stock speeds and running an AVX version of the LinPack (via OCCT), the Corsair Hydro keeps the 4770k between 56-64 Celsius.At stock speeds and running an AVX version of the LinPack (via OCCT), the Cooler Master 212+ keeps the  4770k between 62-68 Celsius.With a mild overclock to 3.9Ghz for all 4 cores and running an AVX version of the LinPack (via OCCT), the Corsair Hydro keeps the 4770k between 85-90 Celsius.With a mild overclock to 3.9Ghz for all 4 cores and running an AVX version of the LinPack (via OCCT), the Cooler Master 212+ keeps the 4770k running between 80-85 Celsius.As you can see, the Corsair Hydro 80i runs only a few degrees Celsius cooler than the Cooler Master 212+.  This is hardly a breakthrough compared to air cooling.  Notably, the Corsair was actually worse at dissipating heat while overclocking than the Cooler Master 212+.  Moreover, the Corsair Hydro 80i did not help me address the ""AVX problem"" that Haswell has.  Haswell runs hot.  When executing the new AVX2 instructions, Haswell runs REALLY hot.  Ultimately, this is a design flaw by Intel.  However, I was hoping that a decent water cooler could help get a handle on the issue.  Unfortunately, the Corsair 80i didn't.The Corsair 80i also has a number of design flaws that make installation a pain.  First, the rubber hoses are stiff and filled with coolant, which makes them hard to bend and flex into place.  The result is that the hoses only bend in certain directions, so you can't just install and align as you see fit.  It's not like folding a wire.Second, the cooling plate has TOO much thermal paste.  In order to make the cooler installable on Ivy Bridge-E, Haswell, and AMD systems, they put a square patch of thermal paste equal in size to the biggest processor this is designed for.  Unfortunately, this means that the area covered by thermal paste is larger than the corresponding surface area of some processors (e.g. Haswell).  So I had to remove the factory paste and apply my own.  Not a big deal, but realize you will need to purchase a separate tube of thermal paste if you have a sma"," I'm keeping it, but only because I'm too lazy to pull my computer apart to reinstall my old Cooler Master 212+ and attempt to return or resell my now used.  My case has incredible airflow, but it is essentially impossible to access the backplate with the motherboard installed.  So my only option for changing coolers is to remove the motherboard, change out the coolers, and reinstall the motherboard.  Not hard to do, but long and tedious enough that I'm not going to do it multiple times if I can avoid it.  Also, my old CoolerMaster Hyper-212+ leans against one of my DIMMS, which can only be solved by moving the offending fan off-center, which is an effective but aesthetically annoying solution.As I said, this isn't a bad cooler (which is why I did not give the review one or two eggs).  It's just that there are better value air coolers out there (which is why I did not give the review 4 or 5 eggs).  In my mind, a high-end close-loop liquid cooler, which is what the Hydro 80i is positioned as, should be able to out compete a cheap, base model air cooler like the reliable Cooler Master 212+.",0,1

Not a huge problem, just a minor irritation."," Regardless of the issues I personally had, I highly recommend this product and have successfully gotten 2 other friends to get one as well.

Should fit into most cases without much difficulty.," Relatively hard to install and requires several connections that need to be routed somewhat thoughtfully. The Corsair Link software does not detect the H80i under Windows 8.1 with my hardware (ASUS Z87-PRO). Research has turned up no solution. The pump cannot be detected by the software and there is no way to update the firmware since the software doesn't see the pump. Catch 22! This device should be plug and play and it is most decidedly not. I have no control over any of the neat features of the device, including fan speeds."," My pump is working despite not being detected and is keeping the cpu cool even under heavy loads (i5-4670K at stock speed held at 48 C after 1 hour of prime95 torture test).

I purchased an H70 about 2 years ago and the pump started to make a loud noise. It was still under warranty so I went thru the RMA process for a replacement. After my initial email, within two days I had an RMA approval and I returned my H70. After Corsair recieved it, I did not get an update notice for about a week. I was concerned about my replacement so I contacted Corsair live chat. The rep (I apologize I did not get his name Eric C ?) found my return had not been processed, so he immediately did so manually. Within three days I received an upgraded H80i, which was more than I had originally purchased. I don't know why my return sat a week, but after I contacted them they immediately took care of my issue! I also filed an RMA several months ago after I broke a USB port on my 600T. Eventhough it was my fault, Corsair immediately sent me at no charge a replacement top panel. This is the reason why I always have and will continue to purchase Corsair products, they stand by what they sell.

If you're using this in a media PC you will want replacement fans.- CorsairLink2 software is pretty terrible (more on this later).- Mounting holes on the radiator strip incredibly easily. I replaced the fans one time and have one mounting hole that no longer grips the screw.- Fan controller died after ~6-7 months of use, causing RMA."," I originally came from a static, huge copper heat-sink and was wary about going to liquid. Closed loop systems such as the Corsair series seemed promising, and seemed okay at first. The install process was easy (push/pull), but ever since then it's been a pretty decent struggle to get it to do what I want. The accompanying software is bad. It's clearly still in an ""alpha"" (or beta if you're being generous) state. It occasionally crashes on highly stable systems, it will lose your settings, and it's not very intuitive/user friendly. There are admittedly a ton of options in the software, but there's very little to help you figure out what it does or what you should do for your system. I don't know what the software for other closed loop systems is like, but I'd hope it's more polished. IIf you have stock cooling on your processor/GPU and don't care about noise...this part probably doesn't apply to you. However, if you want a quiet build, you're going to be buying new fans (and don't buy the SP120 quiet edition - they're just stock fans slowed down and don't cool as well as some other options). As mentioned, the fans are quite loud. I use this computer as a media/gaming PC, and when I had friends over I had to change fan profiles and crank up the volume in order to watch a movie comfortably. It was bad enough that I bought new fans (I went with Noctua's) in order to get sound vs. performance that was acceptable. I hate that I spent $60 on fans, but I didn't like my computer sounding like a jet engine when I did anything processor intensive.My system isn't crazy - I'm running an AMD FX 8350 overclocked to anywhere between 4.5-4.8 GHz depending on the day, and this thing did a pretty okay job cooling it...when it worked, and only after I spent hours screwing around with the software. I'd say it never let me get over 55-58C. So there's that....of course, when the fan controller died I quickly hit 63C, which is above the acceptable temperature of 62C. So that's not cool. Additionally, the mounting holes are stripped already, and I've only replaced fans once, meaning I've got one screw hole that just sits there looking pretty but doing nothing. That's pretty unacceptable in itself if you plan on using this unit for a while, as I did. I will say the Corsair forums are a great help. The people on there are knowledgeable, and chances are you can figure out your issues with a bit of reading. But for those of you wanting a plug n' play closed loop system that will last you a couple builds while giving the performance you want...I suggest you do some digging into non-Corsair products before pulling the trigger.I'm just starting RMA so I guess I'll comment on that process when I'm done. I WILL say that it's complete B.S. that I have to pay for shipping on their defective part...so I'm already not impressed >.<TL;DR: Easy install. Software is still in beta/sucks. Loud. Cools decently. Flimsy screw holes that don't last. Unit broke",1,1

Radiator is pretty thick. I can run my computer normally with all fans off and only pump on and still stays cool. Fans can rip pretty fast, but I leave them at lower rpms and it gets the job done nicely. Pump is quiet. Speedfan says it's at 2300 rpm and I set it to full on. It plugs into PSU with SATA power cable (hard drive cable) then pump sensor to cpu fan sensor. You can plug the fans into the pump if you use the usb link, but I just plugged them into my speed controller. (The usb link is not necessary). Comes with thermal paste pre applied.  Also the Corsair logo lights up =]."," Fans are loud at max rpm, back plate was a little tricky to line up. And it is suppose to be lose until you tighten the pump down."," The tubes used are thicker compared to the other series and just as flexible. It's closed loop so maintenance free. Should last 5 years from what I read. Fans are loud but why have them at max rpm?

This time they contracted CoolIt to produce them and not Asetek. If I would have know this prior to purchase I would not have purchased one in the first place (shame on me for not doing research). CoolIT makes the absolute crappiest EVERYTHING and it shows in this H80I.My radiator threads stripped almost immediately after installation. It was about an hour into the burn in and I hear a snap. Look over and the radiator is dangling by two screws. I pulled the two loose screws out and they were encircled in thin metallic threads. Great.Trying to get an RMA with Corsair is like pulling a crocodiles teeth. Submit your ticket and wait and wait and wait. Try to get someone online with their support chat and you wait and wait and wait. Email their CS and you wait and wait and wait. Does anyone actually work at Corsair? If so what are they all doing? Not answering CS tickets thats for sure.  I looked online in several forums and found that I am not alone when it comes to having severe issues with Corsair CS. Its a shame. It really is. Some of their products are actually really good. Temperature wise its pretty basic. 3770k idles at around 38C and Prime 95 at 75C. Its not bad, on par with most middle range air coolers.  The thing is though middle ranges air coolers cost 50 bucks while the H80i was almost 100. Is it really worth it?

Soon after ordering I found the issue was overheating ram but decided to keep the new water cooler anyways and am glad I did. These things are rock solid and the improvement over the H50 from a few years ago is great. It easily fit in my case, the cables have plenty of length for me to tuck them to the side and I love the fan management system. My favorite feature if that the radiator fans get plugged into the water pump for power and control and the water pump gets plugged into the SATA for power. This means that I don't have to modify any bios settings for worry that the bios would throttle down those fans or pump. In addition there is a plug that is especially meant to be plugged into the CPU fan slot that indicates the fan speed such that the BIOS doesn't freak out that there is no cpu fan.

I'm in the process of load testing now on a medium setting (according to the bios in my Gigabyte GA-Z87X-UD3H) and no negatives have popped up.," Corsair's install instructions are lacking in clarity, information, and instructions. It's possible to wipe out you shiny new i5 4670 cpu & Gigabyte motherboard at the same time because of incomplete information and poorly orientated diagrams. Normally we expect to see a diagram laid out in the same way you would be working on the build, but in Corsair's instructions they are shown in a way you would never place your computer while working on it.  These hoses are stiff and if you attempt to mount the cooler where you have the least bending of the hoses, you could be making a big mistake. 2 sides of the cooler are beveled and if the beveled side is not towards the fan assembly the cooler will rest on a row of short capacitors and when you tighten the cooler down it will NOT rest on the cpu top.  And you can't tell or see that from any angle. In addition you will crush or bend the top of the capacitors.  When you boot and run the cores will run about 10 degrees hotter even with no contact, which attributes to the i5 4670's quality and credit.  When you run any stress test your test will peg 100 degrees in about 8 seconds ... not a good thing. If you continue to do this you will probably damage the cpu, and add to that you may have already damaged the motherboard.  This H80i will only fit on this mobo ONE WAY ... just be aware. Moving on ... the ""Connect Fans to Power"" shows a cable going out with no instructions on where to plug the ends into.  Adding to the confusion the ends of this ""Y"" cable have protectors that look like part of the plug.  It would have been nice if Corsair could have pointed that out.  I realize that the box does not say ""Works in a 1150 Socket"" but all over the Internet it's verified that it does.  It would be nice if they pointed out the when you install the backplate and it rattles before you add the cooler ....  that's normal. The instructions should not be in the hands of engineers ... as they will always botch it. Do a little testing Corsair before you print the book.", The parts of the H80i look like quality and well made. It appears to be a good product ... but I'm a little ticked at the amount of time I wasted installing it. And don't tell me you can do it in 15 minutes if you've never installed this particular cooler.,0,2

I received complaints about it sounding like an airplane taking off, could be heard across the house. While the instructions were complete, they were very vague about any issues. They do not instruct that there is a hidden cap on the 4-pin connectors that lead to the block. Instructions advise to set up fans as intake, a poor choice for thermal design inside the case. This forces the GPU to use the recycled hot air. I went with this configuration to keep my case at a positive pressure, despite the lack of fan filters on the installation spot. Many wires coming off of this unit, adding to cable-clutter inside the case.

I had washers I bought which made it more level but even so my results were less than impressive. At 1300 rpms you can slightly hear the fans, anything higher and it's to loud for my tastes. The fans are good and corsair link is cool, but they don't include a 2nd corsair link for 2 additional fans so you are left with the 2 on the radiator. I looked online and buying another is like 10 bucks without shipping, so I feel that's unfair.

You need to WAIT at LEAST 48 hrs and have had your computer run at least some light duty tasks and be power down and up during that time. The thermal paste needs to ""set up"", as it gets thinner as it gets warmer and will fill in the gaps between the CPU and the heat sink. I know the desire is to test it right out of the gate but you will notice far more stable and ideal results if you wait. However if you're idling high, there maybe be a bigger issue.My system idles at a thermal margin 72C (161F) (0 degrees = potential hardware damage) . I did my stress tests running 3Dmark11 and prime95. I wasn't able to get much change from 3Dmark tests, although those are mostly GPU expect the physic tests. However after about 30-45 minutes of running prime95 @ 100% cpu load, i could hit the thermal limit: 12C (53F), got it to slowly drop to 6C (43F) in the next 15 minutes or so. I didn't continue the torture test past that point. As soon as i stopped the system recovered back to original idle in about 10 seconds, so the heat dispersed quickly.I previously had a 3 radiator setup in this rig connecting my CPU and old GPU, that config never even got close to the thermal margin but had more heat dispersion. But for gaming and general duty this setup seems to work just fine.If you have an i7 X980 (my CPU) or greater you may want get the 2 bay rad. But if you plan on doing any rendering or CPU based physic simulations or over clocking. You'll need something bigger.Screw lengths: The screws that secure the fan to the radiator weren't long enough on the chassis mount side (my case was to thick) I went to the hardware store and picked up some screws (#6-32 x 1-1/2in) that were about 1/4 in longer. Now you need to be careful because there are fins behind the thread holes, i used a small screw driver to push them out of the way so when i threaded the screws on tight, it wouldn't do damage. I appreciate that the screws were a standard machine size. So none of that I minded as much as they try one size fits all, some assembly required but it's worth mentioning.The nuts that secure the waterblock to the motherboard mount had to be  tightened all the way down and still felt loose. Using some fabric washers (again, hardware store) on the mount behind the motherboard gave it a more snug fit.All the connections seemed fine between the rad and the pump/block but time will tell.I'm inclined to believe the people who are having issues with this around high heat numbers have either a problem with the lack of a sung fit or are pushing this guy too far for with what they are trying to do. Just remember a water cooled unit (same with air) won't go below room temperature and needs to be factored in. but unlike air, water will have a slower heat increase until the heat and water reach equilibrium.All in I'm happy with this purchase.",1,1

Corsair Link is a great tool to help monitor your temps and fan speeds right from the desktop.," Fans are loud when running at full speed, but they definitely move a lot of air through the radiator.  Push - pull fans make this set up very thick, so in the first mounting position I couldn't close the cover with my 200mm fan mounted in the window.  Moved radiator and both fans to the other side, problem solved.  The bad news came when my CPU over heated and my computer shut down.  I found out that after only 2-3 months of use, the pump began going out.  I could hear it ticking and when I monitor Corsair Link, temps begin to climb under minimal CPU load."," Sadly, when you search for Corsair Water Coolers with ""5 egg"" rating, you'll see one item...It's the refurbished H80i.

9SIA85V4NG1052,35-181-031,4/5/2014 11:08:59 PM,David L.,Leak Check!,2," These are small and great for smallish builds because they allow for better overall airflow in the case than big giant heatsinks, even though high-end aircoolers like the NH-U14S are generally better than AIOs for the actual CPU core temps. When you get up to the H105, the performance starts to cross over towards the AOIs actually being better performers, as well. The advantage to the i series of Hydro products is that they connect the system with the pump and fans, such that if either fail, alarms can be set and you'll have a visual representation of that fact. Still, these events are rare and for most end-users will not occur within the normal lifetime of the product."," Specifically regarding the h80i model, my only experience was a complete failure and a near disaster. Being that it was my very first encounter with any type of water cooling/radiator system I did not know what to expect. My recollection of inspecting the h80i was that the radiator sounded like a small rain stick... I heard a ""trickling"" sound as I turned the radiator over and let the coolant flow down. As it turns out, this is not exactly normal and may have been a clue that something was off about my unit. Upon inspecting the box itself later, it appeared that the cooler was likely leaking slowly while in transit. I installed it in the rear exhaust mount without realizing the danger and it was only because the pump/block/backplate mounting system was a fussy fit with my z87 M6 Hero motherboard and I was getting high idle temperatures that after multiple remounting attempts I decided to lay the case flat and noticed a puddle of oily substance slowly forming on my work area. Later inspection of my midtower confirmed the leak was slowly creeping down my motherboard and evaporating, leaving a powdery film behind. It had formed a small chalky puddle-outline at the very bottom of my case even. And yet, no damage done. I cleaned up the motherboard with 90% alcohol and sent the unit back for refund. I'm thankful nothing more serious occurred, and I did eventually give a different Corsair model a try.I did not like the number of attachments to the pump mechanism on the i models. I did not realize there would be a USB plug, for example, much less plugs for the fans. It makes for a slightly less pretty block area and a lot more cable routing around the VRM area is required. If the pump fails, there's really no way to know other than temps or the color of the light/software alerts if they are available on your unit. If you are doing things with crazy temps and don't know your pump has failed you could experience a leak like I did.  If you think Corsair will warranty your whole system because of a failure, you are wrong unless you are in Australia."," I ended up with 2 H50s. I have one as a backup or for use in a future build, they both work equally well and were much easier to install on my z87 board than the h80i was.  The one thing you gotta be careful about with the h50/55 style mounts is overtightening the mounting screws and stripping the backplate such that  you need needlenose pliers to ever get the backplate off again. The sticky foam used to prevent the plastic backplate from crushing the metal pins on the sides of the CPU area is too effective. It is almost impossible to remove and requires lots of patience.",None,None

9SIA85V4NG1052,35-181-031,11/23/2014 11:41:35 PM,Jared D.,"Time will tell, amazed so far",4," Let me start by saying I'm growing very very weary of closed loops in general, my initial recommendation is if you're going to water cool, spend the money and get yourself a custom loop set up, otherwise stick with air as performance is comparable but these tend to cost more than air solutions, and if something goes wrong with an air cooler 99% of the time you just slap in a few fan(s).When something goes wrong with a water cooler, it can and likely will be disastrous in some way, shape or form.My old H60 recently failed (I know, I know, you get what you pay for.) My warranty was void because i took one of the ugly stickers off of the radiator on it, so instead of even bothering with a replacement (I would never want an H60 again) I traveled to (insert competing hardware store/distributor) and they had this h80i on sale.I wanted an air cooler but the selection was negligible, so I decided to roll the dice a second time on a closed loop.I'm absolutely astounded at the cooling increase between this and the H60 I'm coming from, my idles at best with the H60 were 30-35 C, hitting upwards of 70-80 with prime 95 (Push-Pull).Then the H60 pump started getting wacky, strange thing is the pump speed indicator said it was runing strong and it did seem to be pushing fluid.Long story short, I installed the h80i and was immediately blown away with the difference, and out of curiosity I drained the old H60, cut it open/gutted it, and exposed the pump to try and diagnose what the problem was the last few weeks (chip nearly fried itself while I was diagnosing what was wrong).Upon tipping the radiator to drain the remaining coolant, out flows a whole bunch of green/black particulate, along with a few sizable chunks which were obviously restricting/blocking coolant flow causing my ridiculously high idle and load temps. On top of this, exposing the pump and inspecting led me to the conclusion that there was a strange, semi-solid buildup which indicated corrosion but I can't be too sure, point being I'm glad I removed it and replaced it when I did, as continuing to run my H60 surely would have resulted in some kind of catastrophe.Now, as for this product, onto the PROS:-Keeps my 3570k at between 25-30C idle, which comparably is amazing. MAX load after running Prime for a few hours straight it barely even kissed 50C, hottest core hit 48C. For me, this is absolutely amazing.-Double-wide radiator, fat FPI (fins per inch) rating, very open to allow for loads of airflow and it shows.-Corsair LINK is very handy, although I don't feel it to fully necessitate all of the extra cables/wiring, but given a bit of patience and some crafty handwork it can still be made to look very neat even while using the optional Corsair link cable and pump-housed-fan header.-Logo is actually illuminated, I had assumed this was the case with the H60 but I should have researched the product better before buying, because it wasn't. This is a welcome"," No cons so far, but I must say in all honesty that I tend to recommend against closed loops now as a rule, between my recent issues and numerous issues with friends with closed loops (more specifically, Corsairs H series), they're just not serviceable by the average user (and orsair would likely recommend against it), meanwhile most air coolers have less moving parts and if something goes wrong it's a fan or just needs new paste/reseat.If low noise is a must or you're a liquid cooling enthusiast who can't afford or justify the purchase of a custom loop like me, then this may be a good solution.As for CONS:-Radiator is HUUUGE, this is a good thing, but it's a double edged blade for those working in rather cramped cases. I have this installed in my Corsair C70 case in push/pull, and with one fan on each side of the radiator (with this particular cooler, you really do need a fan on each side to facilitate airflow through a radiator this thick).it doesn't allow very much room/clearance. Doable, but still pretty cramped. It worked fine for me, but those of you with slightly smaller cases may have issues with this one and may have to play around with configuration.-So many cables going to and fro... NO matter what I do I just can't make it look nearly as clean and minimalist as my H60 was, seeing as it was just one power cable for the pump (to a fan header on mobo), and the fans could be routed in their own way behind the board/wherever you wanted them, it made for a cleaner look. Still, if you can appreciate what they're there for, the purpose they serve and you like the corsair LINK feature, it might be worth it.-As many have mentioned, the ""Y cable"" as mentioned in the manual was extremely misleading. Nothing in the manual mentions that there are plastic protective covers that need to be popped/slipped off in order to be able to hook up your 2 fans to the pump header. (As far as I know this is optional however, as you could simply run the fans to motherboard fan header, at the cost of losing out on advanced fan control and some LINK features.)Instructions were okay otherwise, but Corsair seriously needs to add and/or bold a section on that step about how the y cable does fit regular 4 pin fans, but the plastic covers create the illusion that they are the wrong connector type."," This review is subject to change, as I just got it, installed it, and ran a few hours worth of prime and other benchmarks.If something goes wrong this review will be updated asap to warn potential buyers, but so far so good.... actually, so far so great. Well worth the money.It's a great cooler if you're in the market for a closed loop utilizing a single 120mm radiator, this is a very good contender. I will update when/if something goes wrong, and to be honest (not to display lack of faith in Corsair, of course...) I'm kind of half-expecting something to go wrong withing 6-12 months, as so far these closed loops just have not proven to be reliable for me or others I'm in touch with and moving parts always = more potential for problems.Thankfully Corsair has a great warranty policy, but mine was void due to removing a sticker according to their website. Yeah, a sticker... No harm though, as like I said I wouldn't have wanted a replacement, I wanted an upgrade. As far as I can tell, that's exactly what I got, the temps speak for themselves.",5,5

I did not recognize that Y-cable is where the radiator fans connect to the pump.  I connected the fans to the motherboard CPU fan headers.

Boots up my AMD FX-8320 Vishera at a nice 2 degrees C. Cools it to a mere 12 degrees C during heavy load. Looks pretty inside my rig. RGB LED logo is snazzy.," The reason I'm docking an egg is that I had a heck of a time getting the heatsink to seat properly on my chip and had to mess with my registry to get the software to work properly. Plus, it was confusing setting up the fans properly. Plus, this thing is really loud even WITH the fans set up properly. First, I did install the cooler properly according to directions for my AMD cpu. And I did believe it was seated well. But when I had to remove the cooler for repair (I was exercising some cable management and accidentally snipped through the fan header cable, ouch) and fan orientation (I had discovered I had the rear-most fan backwards, creating a terribly loud wind tunnel effect which believe me you don't want to hear right after you build a gaming rig), I saw that the thermal compound was only covering about 2/3 of my chip. Clearly it hadn't been seated properly even though it had been installed as directed. I don't know if I improved it at all but I did take extra care to align everything the second time around. This was my first time using a water cooler and so I really was a newb with how to set up the radiator. I had installed my fans facing the same way which created this negative air suck which was the loudest, most annoying thing in the world on boot. I was kind of freaked out thinking I had something faulty in there. After some research I determined that I had just installed my fans wrong. When I had to take the cooler out to repair my header cable, I fixed the position of the fans. Basically they should both be facing the same way which I was able to determine from the sticker rather than any directional markings on the fan cases. Not a big deal.But the fans are still a little loud for my preference. Nothing terrible, but at least 10x louder than my old Zalman cooler. That thing was silent. I really wish this was quieter without losing performance. All of that isn't why I'm really docking an egg though. To be fair, some of those issues could be partially me.The thing that really annoyed me was that I had to reset a few lines in my registry (Windows 8.1) to get the Corsair Link software to recognize my cooler (haha). It wasn't painful or anything but I really think a product that has such high market saturation, especially a premium enthusiast product, should have better software support on the manufacturer's side. I get that it is likely that people with the hardware are at least entry level enthusiasts with decent tech knowledge, but we shouldn't have to regedit to get the controlling software to find the hardware. I did get the computer to find the cooler and after that it was nice to use the Link software. I like that I can change the color of the LED logo. It's just looks, but it's cool. And the visual layout of the system with the temp labels is actually helpful to see, so that was cool after it all.Not too much to take away from this being a great cooling product, but there are definitely things that"," ASUS M5A97 R2.0 with AMD-FX 8320 Vishera, 8GB GSkill Ares 2133, Corsair H80i, 128GB SanDisk SSD, 240 GB Seagate Barracuda, MSI 9800 GTX (upgraded today and waiting for MSI GTX 760 4GB!), and Windows 8.1.

I had to buy 8 rubber washers to put on the posts on the back plate to get it to snug up properly."," I have been building computers for well over 10 years and have not had any issues until I purchased this contraption. I first installed the cooler and booted up my computer expecting great cooling results. I started up BF4 ran it for maybe 2 minutes, went back to windows and checked my temp and to my disappointment it was at 230F!!!!!! I dissembled the computer and removed the heat sink off my CPU and there was just a sliver of it touching the CPU. I changed how the heat sink was mounted by turning it a 1/4 turn and tightened it up again. Booted the computer, started BF4 and was able to play for an hour or so, but the temps were still way worse than my aftermarket CPU cooler I had on prior.

I noticed that the stock fan was constantly spinning up and down at idle. I checked the temps with HW monitor and sure enought the cpu was sitting at 70c idle. I cleaned out the dust and put new thermal paste on the cpu which dropped it to about 55c which is high for a plex server not doing much of anything. I took the plunge and brought this cooler. Idle speeds at 35c now and even when running 95 prime for an hour temp never cracked 45c.It may have saved my from having to rebuild the server for a couple more years.- All In 1.- 5 year Warranty- Cosair Link - AMD Mounting hardware is easy, Not really the fault of cosair but even if you have a 120 mm fan spot make sure you have enough clearance between the radiator and the top of your case as the radiator sticks out above and below the fans that sandwich it. It was easier to install with two people in this situation as we had to drill holes in the case for it and it took awhile to install but that's not their fault so I am not subtracting an egg for it.

When I recently upgraded my case, I decided to take the plunge with the H80i and hoped to lower the temps and increase the clock to maybe 4.5.Install was easy, as previously mentioned.  Idle temps were great, 26-32C.  I knew something was up as soon as I started running benchmarking tests (Prime95, OCCTPT4.4.1, Ripbot 264) and temp was hitting > 85c at stock clocks. I tried a very minor 4.0 overclock and temps hit the 99C ceiling causing a CPU throttle while using Prime95. After some research, I re-seated the cooler block 2 additional times. For the initial install I used the pre-installed thermal paste, for the additional installs I used Arctic Silver 5 after using the Arctic Clean 2-step cleaning process.  I noticed all three times the thermal paste was not evenly touched by contact.  The first installation I went until the screws were tight, not super tight.  The second install I went even tighter, still only about 60% coverage.  The final time, I went until the screws would turn no more and was really worried I was going to break something. The screws were so tight one of the heads started to strip!  That's when I knew this was nuts and something is not working correctly.When the 3rd time produced somewhat better results, around 78C, I was very dissatisfied and decided to RMA the cooler back to Newegg.  Since returning, I kept searching for reasons why and found an overclocking forum where a user installed rubber hard drive washers (the kind that reduces vibration noise) on the mount.  Too late for me as I had already went through the RMA process and purchased the UPS label.I started to search for something else and may go with Noctua NH-D14 or the NZXT Kraken X61",0,1

I say, lessen the price of the rad and let the consumer buy their own, better fans!Performance was not enough to keep a 220W AMD FX-9370 @ 5GHz from getting too hot (65 to 70+C: shutdown temps) when running intensive programs, so had to adjust clock to 4.7 (stock turbo clock sans the turbo-core tech.)I can say that I wasn't expecting this single-rad solution to keep my 220W cool enough so no more eggs being docked.  But I will say, based on TDP performance in my scenario, that this is probably a plenty good rad for most of those with 125W CPU's.The reason I say this is because I'm still running a 125W FX-8320 @ 4.2 on air and it runs great.  I was hoping for a little more out of this unit, but was disappointed.  So I bought an h100i LOL and was going to try that out but now I've given the PC to my customer so I can't assess 220W performance w/ the other product.Hope this helps those judging what kind of rad to buy!",1,1

The H-80i was able to keep my I-7 4790 at an average core temperature of 60c during a two hour Prime95 test with an ambient temperature of 26c. This test was conducted after having the H80i installed for two weeks to give the thermal paste time I used time to set. The thermal paste I used during this test was the Arctic Silver 5 due to receiving a bad processor previous to the one used during this test resulting in needing to remove the thermal compound that came on the H-80i water block.When I initially received my H-80i it had a fan that ticked. I attempted to RMA just the fan via corsair's website but was unable to because I did not have the part number for just the fan. I contacted Corsair via their support live text chat. The representative helped me by filling out a form to begin the process. Unfortunately the representative filled out the form improperly and after a week of waiting for resolution and the difficult process of finding Corsair's phone number I contacted a representative via phone. I was very disappointed that they no longer advertised this number on their website although they do tell you what hours this phone service is available for on their website.The representative I reached on the phone was very helpful and had a new fan shipped to me which I received in less than a week.The H-80 that I replaced although rated at a higher db level for noise seemed quitter due to the noise being more of a white noise sound of air rushing through the radiator. The H-80i has a higher pitch mechanical  sound and although having a lower db level is much more noticeable due to the pitch.I have read that plugging the H-80i into a usb port on the motherboard and updating it's firmware via the Corsair Link software will correct this however, after updating I have found it to still be there. It seems that the update merely lowered the initial rpm of the fans making it less noticeable but under load the fans still must spool up resulting in the sound still occurring.",None,None

While gaming the temp would rise to about 48C.  At 100% load, running Prime 95, the temp never rose above 60C."," After only 5 months I noticed the temps were idle around 39/40C most of the time.  I clean my PC every month so I know the radiator is not dirty.  I removed the H80i from my PC and immediately noticed a lot of sloshing noise coming from the radiator that wasn't present when I installed it.  This usually indicates that the system is low on fluid and has a lot of air in the system.  Unfortunately the H80i is a closed loop system and cannot be refilled.  At no time have I noticed any liquid in or around my PC.  I think the liquid is evaporating.While I had the H80i out, I cleaned off all of the stock thermal paste from the pump and my CPU using a Artic Silver thermal material remover.  Then I prepared the CPU and the heat sink with Thermal surface purifier.  I then applied Artic Silver 5 thermal compound and reassembled everything.   My temps were now even better, indicating 2 to 3 degrees lower than before.That was one month ago and over the course of that month, my temps have once again risen to about 40C.

I searched the web for info on the clicking noise and tried every possible solution I could find, from changing the fans and pump to other plugs, changing the USB feed to a different port.

My search for a solution has found forums full of complaints and problems with the H80i and the H100i.

It works well, and the hoses were long enough to mount the radiator on the front of my spec-1 corsair case.My old case was more enclosed than the new one, and the sound of the fans on 100% was very loud.  On the new case, with a more open design, the fan volume is almost unbearable at 100%, so I turned down my overclock instead.

My case only allowed up to 82mm of cpu cooler clearance and I didn't want to deal with the headache of finding a compatible heatsink.

The fan sounded like a jet turbine. I've since replaced it with a quieter Zalman fan, so no big deal. BUT I still cannot deal with the noises coming out of the pump. In idle, the H60's pump is by far the loudest thing in my case.

Under load, new high temps are in the 50s.-Very quiet.  I'm not sure why everyone was complaining about the noise, but it looks like in the old model they used a different fan.-Quality materials.  This thing is very heavy, but it's because the rubber is industrial strength, and the water block is sturdy.  Other reviewers said the screws are garbage, but I found them quite solid.", -Installation.  The directions are deceptively simple -- there are some unwritten steps so to speak.-Really only installable one way. I'm not sure how you could install this in my case and motherboard other than the prescribed way of: intake mounted on the back of the case with the water block hoses facing the DIMMs. Something to consider if you have a uniquely shaped system.," -1 egg only because the installation was trickier than the instructions suggest.  The problem I ran into was that for an LGA 1155 mobo there is a rear mounting bracket that is to be attached via standoff screws to the water block.  What the instructions don't say is that the standoff screws for this bracket don't fully secure the bracket in place which is what I'm used to with standoff screws. So when the rear mounting bracket is fully in place, there is a considerable amount of slack on the standoff screws.  Once the water block and front mounting bracket are in place firmly with thumbscrews will the entire apparatus be secure.Bottom line: if you are installing on an Intel 1150, 1155, or 1156 board, it's OK to have a loose rear bracket mid-way through install.One recommendation I got from someone else in the reviews is to power the intake fan blowing over the radiator on your 4 prong CPU fan port on the motherboard and power the pump somewhere else.  I loved this idea, and it's working very well for me. My solution was to power the pump directly off a Molex connector to the PSU so I'm at full throttle on the pump all the time, and the fan only ramps up when the CPU starts heating up. Response time on this radiator is short, so this build works very well.  You could also put the fan into a motherboard 3 pin port, but you would have to manipulate the BIOS or some software to run that port at 100% all the time.Lastly, since the recommended configuration is to install the fan as an intake on the rear wall of the case, I was required to move my exhaust fan elsewhere.  This isn't the end of the world, but keep that in mind before you buy this.  Another solution reviewers have discussed is the push/pull setup on the radiator.  I don't see the need for it because even after overclocking my CPU by more than 31% it was still a relatively cool 55º C.  Just make sure you have the number of fans and fan ports you need before reconfiguring your system.System:Mobo: ASUS P8P67CPU: Intel i5 2500k 3.3GHzRAM: Corsair 4x4GB (kinda bulky.

This compared to the stock cooler on my previous build which ran closer to 70c. Previous build was an AMD 965 3.4Ghz quad. The cooler that came with that CPU is the same that came with my new 8365 8 core 4.0(2) Ghz CPU.Idle temps run 29c to 33c, depending on ambient temperatures. Under load, you can easily feel how warm the hot-side manifold of the radiator gets...while the cold-side manifold 'feels' about ambient. Well built, quiet, no leaks.Granted I'm only hitting one core of my CPU hard, (core six at app 90%....which I assume is Crysis 2 still running in the background). I don't have any real complaints to register about this cooling solution, other than the one concern noted in the 'cons'.Note to N/A who posted on 9/8:Mounting problem, or faulty unit. If you've tried to remount the cold plate, you should always remove the existing heat sink compound, clean both surfaces thoroughly, and reapply a quality heat sink compound, (sparingly). I hope you've elected to replace the unit and try again."," My only complaint, and one I can't honestly deduct an egg for, is that hot air is exhausted into the computer case.

I would rather have stiff hoses then limp ones.  I put the radiator in first, then mounted the water block.  This kept any tension on the processor socket (caused by bending the hoses around) to a minimum during installation.

With my stock clockrate of 3.2ghz (quad) temps would get up to ~60c under stress.  Now with this cooler attached I can safely overclock to 4.0ghz and at that clockrate I am now seeing temps no higher than ~34c idle and ~55c under stress.

My brand new build with this liquid cooler is in my full tower case.  I would recommend to use it on a full tower case and may be manageable on a mid tower case.  It is much more quiet than heatsink/fan and it let you disassemble the rear fan on the case to be mounted on other part of the case that doesn't has a fan mounted on it.

Far easier than my Cooler Master 212 EVO (which is an amazing cooler).  I followed the instructions that were included and everything went in just fine.  It is fairly quiet when not operating at high RPM.  It is also a decent cooler.  It keeps my i5-4670k Haswell CPU around 38 C at idle and then jumps to around 60-65 C under load.," The quality of this device is terrible.  I installed mine and was immediately annoyed by the volume of the fan when at full blast (2100 RPM) as it super loud.  It is easy to hear it when we are watching an action film with the surround sound turned up.  But I was able to forgive the loud fan since I often wear headphones.  The biggest complaint I have is the pump and its constant clicking sound.  Initially I thought it was the mechanical hard drive, but it wasn't even in use.  The pump sound can be heard from across my living room, even while watching TV.  When playing a game it becomes unbearable and sounds like something is going to break.  I did an RMA through Corsair (which is a joke as they expect you to pay shipping for their defective product) and received a replacement a few days later.

(non-common sense people need not comment)- Did I mention the performance? See comments below for in depth results.," No cons really, but to be thorough...1. AMD bracket and back plate could use some work. The Intel bracket and back plate is made of metal while the AMD utilizes the original plastic back plate and uses 2 connection points vs 4 on the Intel.2. They don't include extra hardware to setup a push/pull configuration if you purchase an extra fan.3. While the radiator is thin (great heat transfer) it naturally is wider than 120mm. This being said, you are limited in most cases where to place it and how to orient it. For instance I have and Antec 1200 case. The top rear consists of 2 120mm fans stacked. Because of the radiators extra width, I could only place it in the lower spot. And once in the lower spot, it spilled over the other fan location which made it impossible to utilize the top spot for another fan.

I haven't figured out how to over-clock yet but I don't see any problems with heat with this thing installed.," Can be a little difficult to install if your processor is close to the rear of the case. I had to really force the plate down to the processor because the tubes are so stiff. And the fan seems a bit loud at times but I also do have 7 other fans in my case so it's hard to tell what's making what noise. Overall, it's really not that bad. You just have to make sure you have enough space for it which I don't really see a problem with because it's the same size as the rear fan."," I've never had a water-cooler before so this is my first one.

Once you get it figured out it does a fantastic job.," I installed this into a Rosewill Blackhawk gaming MID ATX tower. The raditor and fan assembly went directly in place of the rear exhaust fan. No issues or extra parts required. The pump bracket for an AMD chipset was simple to connect. No extra work needed to modify the board like is necessary with Intel boards. The only issue I found confusing was which fan headers on the motherboard the pump and radiator fan belonged on. The various forums on the net say different solutions and varying opinions. I talked with Corsairs customer service techinicians about this, very helpful and polite. Answered all my questions thuroughly and didnt talk down to me like some tech companies do. In the end I connected the Radiator fan's (2X) to the CPU fan header. This allows the fans to cool the radiator based on the CPU temp as necessary. I placed the pump controller on the CPU OPT for a continuous 12v power draw for steady even operation.I have the ASUS Crosshair V Formula Z board. I run fan expert tool and it shows the board now at 24C and the CPU at 25C at idle or basic processing. I leave the fans at the standard use setting, can turn them up to performance or silent if needed.  After an hour of gaming in Diablo 3 I hadnt eclipsed 28C. When rendering multiple HD scenes in Autodesk 3DS Max I still failed to break the 30C barrier. And running Splinter Cell Blacklist I hit 31C. This is my first liquid cooling solution for a heat sink. In the past the risk of damage to my components always worried me. I wont say I am not concerned it could happen still, but the craftsmanship that I saw when I opened the box was superb. Thick tubing well insulated for coolant transfer between pump and radiator. The mounts for the radiator hoses are secure.  I wrapped them with a self sealing weather tape I use on antenna connectors. Once set the glue in the tape hardens and becomes water proof. I did this to negate any possible doubt in my mind that the system could infact break and leak on my components.Now the newer versions of the H60 have heavier grade rubber tubes, they look like what I see in my truck engine. As such they displace more area and depending on your motherboard they can get close to your ram modules. Mine are close to touching. So just consider your component proximity on your motherboard before buying this product. Overall I am very happy with this purchase, it performs just like I hoped it would, I havent overclocked my CPU yet, but I imagine it will handle the load just fine.

Setup was easy and the pre-applied thermal paste was a bonus as there was more than enough on the pump. Had all the right connectors to attach to my ASRock 990FX Extreme3 AM3+ AMD 990FX  MoBo., None., I like the Corsair static pressure fan that was included for the radiator but works better if you buy another and do a push pull configuration especially if you plan to overclock.,1,1

N82E16835181030,35-181-030,1/29/2014 6:26:53 PM,S S.,Amazing Water Cooler,5," Made by Corsair, extremely efficient water cooling system, simple installation, superb performance, weight nothing compared to one of those gigantic 'tower' heatsinks and takes up very little space and the price; far cheaper than building your own."," Hoses are about 1"" too long and the water block mounting bracket that attaches to the back of the motherboard needed to be modified (read other thoughts)."," If you want the reference for this review, look for the review posted by Jared G. on 12/8/2013 at 1:41:10 PM. In addition to the same Corsair H60 water cooler, I also chose the same CPU (Intel i7 4770K) and motherboard (ASUS Z87-PRO) that Jared selected. Consequently and during installation, I also discovered the exact same problem with the water block mounting bracket that attaches to the back of the motherboard that Jared encountered. I also applied the same 'fix' he came up with. With the ""fix"" in place, the water block/pump assembly fit as tight as a drum to the i7, after bolting everything down. I chose to remove whatever thermal paste Corsair applied to the copper water block contact surface, and instead used Arctic Silver 5, which I KNOW works extremely well. At stock CPU settings, I never saw the CPU core temperature go above 28 C, even under load. At idle, it hovered between 22 and 23 C. At 4.3 GHz (a mild over-clock), the idle core temperature hovered between 27 and 28 C and under load, it never got above 32 C (that's 89 F). I used a pair of 120 mm fluid bearing fans from NewEgg in a push-pull configuration (the radiator sandwiched between them), and all the other case fans were either 120 mm or 140 mm fluid bearing fans as well. With the two fans on the radiator cranked up ALL the way (via a fan controller) and the other 6 fans in the case running at half speed, you have to put your head right next to the case to hear anything at all. It's barely a whisper of sound, and while listening to music, even at moderately low levels, you can't hear anything at all from the computer. It is, for all intents and purposes, dead silent. That IS the beauty of water cooling. No screaming heatsink fans to deal with.I first started building water cooled computers back in the early 90s, when there was no such thing as a ready to install water cooling system. I felt down-right spoiled installing the Corsair system, and it works every bit as well as ANY custom water cooling system I've ever built ... at WELL under half the price. Back then, you'd pay 50 bucks just for a radiator, and you don't EVEN want to know how much a high quality copper water block and Eheim water pump would set you back.  No, the Corsair water block isn't lapped and polished, but it works remarkably well, regardless. Like Jared, I also plugged the Corsair water pump into a dedicated 12 volt Molex connector. Plugging it into a fan header on the motherboard just seems like a bad idea to me. I can't imagine why Corsair even recommends doing that. The KEY to this water cooling system is to MAKE SURE YOU GET SOLID CONTACT BETWEEN THE WATER BLOCK AND THE CPU, which is easily accomplished with Jared's ""fix"". Read HIS review for all the gory details ... especially if you're considering purchasing the H60, which in my humble opinion is one of the best water cooling systems you can buy ... at ANY price.",1,3

Kept my 4770K very cool while running very quietly"," As with a bunch of other reviewers on here, I too had a leak, though not disastrous like others had. I bought a new computer case and was moving my components over, before I got the cooler totally disconnected I noticed a liquid on the fan connected to the radiator. Yep, it was leaking out of one of the fittings. Luckily it didn't explode all over my computer case like the experience others had.Not that it mattered anyway, the screw holes on the radiator are incredibly soft metal and stripped with minimal effort.

Silent under Idle, very effective under load, still quieter than most air coolers I've used. Don't have a huge chunk of metal hanging off your motherboard! AMD installation is a breeze, literally takes a few minutes at most. Uses the stock AMD cooler retention set up. Have this on an FX 8320 set to 4.0 GhZ @ 1.308 V. Idle temps 18-20 degrees C. Temps hover around 50 degrees C or so max after 1 hour of Prime 95 stress testing. Used stock TIM that came with it. Mine sits in a very well ventilated case."," Very slight buzzing noise coming from the fan under high load, nothing too bad though. Not enough of an issue to deduct an egg.Not really a con, but it would be nice to have a slightly stronger fan come with this unit for a bit more overclocking potential. The one that comes with it seems to be one of the SP 120 quiet edition fans from Corsair. Still a good fan regardless."," Overall, very nice unit, especially for the price. I paid $65 for it, about the same as a good air cooler. Some good air coolers will perform as good as or better than this, but are generally louder and take up a lot of space.

You could buy kits of course, most did.. but there was more risk in these setups due to leaks, et al.    This is a self contained unit, coolant already sealed inside. You install it, and essentially forget it.2) It's roughly on par with the best Air cooler on the market.. in my opinion the top of the line Noctua ND-14.. Which I also use in another system.  Price points are very similar.  The edge goes to the H60 though,.. but I found the Noctua air cooler (traditional heatsink/fan) to be virtually identical to the H50's performance.3) Improved design in several areas.  The tubing is higher quality and thicker than before.  The radiator is larger, and the heatsink contact (which is also the pump) is redesigned.  The pumps of the new products are also ""fixed"" with an issue that used to cause an audible humming noise. (Was a power issue).4) Great , long, warranty -- Corsair has fairly good customer support. 5) Keeps temps down when OC'ing.  There is little need for a cooler of this caliber if you aren't overclocking your CPU.  Use the stock heatsink and fan (or buy a $20-$30 heatsink/fan combo if you are not into overclocking.)With my 4th Gen Haswell (Intel 4770k) I have it up to 4.8Ghz, stable, and temps with this cooler (with it's STOCK , pre-applied Thermal compound) run 29c Idle,.. and top out around 70c under load (prime95, etc).Haswell chips run a bit hotter due to intel using thermal paste instead of directly soldering the ""lid"" to the cpu die.. This isn't new to the 4th gen chips, they've been doing it a few gen's now.  But the ""haswell running hot issue is greatly blown out of proportion.).Point is this cooling solution works, and I am proof with an intel i7-4770k at 4.8Ghz (which would be a bit over 5Ghz on a previous generation chip)."," To be objective -- It's hard to come up with any major cons..But,.. A con would be installation.  This won't apply directly to most.  However, I am using an ASUS Z87-PRO motherboard with my i7-4770k.With this H60, the backplate bracket didn't fit properly.  It has a 1-2mm more clearance after secured than it should.  It needs to be mounted where there is no ""play"" or movement in the bracket or securing screws under the motherboard or on top where the socket is.I'm not sure if this is a production issue/error with Corsair and the brackets, or the Asus motherboard I have being thinner than most other 1150's.  MOST people would either not realize there was a problem and install the cooler with the ""loose"" backplate.. OR realize it isn't secured properly and contact corsair for a replacement bracket, which may end up being the exact same thing.Given my nature, and my career I work with fixing issues and coming up with solutions for things like this every day.  So I just modified the bracket to fit my particular motherboard - where it would secure tightly, with zero movement.My method requires special tools.  However, if you happen to have this issue -- You can pull off the backplate rivets/inserts (that go through the 4 holes on the motherboard) and simply find washers of the right thickness then put the black pieces back on TOP of the washers and use trial and error until you get a perfect fit.  (Search the web, you can find some topics and pictures on this.)I would recommend contacting corsair specifically just to be safe.. if you aren't confident in modifying ""new"" equipment.Another con -- The pumps can ""still"" make a little noise.  This is a voltage/power problem.  If you have your pump plugged into a motherboard header (as is instructed by the manual) and it is making noise.. Use the supplied 3pin to Molex adapter and plug it directly into a Molex from your PSU.  This WILL eliminate pump noise as it will be fed a solid voltage that does not vary.  The pump makes noise when it gets variable voltages, or is otherwise under powered.The pump is designed to be ""able"" to run at variable RPMS -- but it does not decrease pump life to plug into a PSU molex and thus it will run at max rated ""rpm"" .. and frankly, this is what I recommend when installing from the start.  A pump is more likely to fail, or have lifespan shortened with a less stable power supply (ie: Off a MB header) than from a stable rail off the PSU.The only disadvatange of this is you will lose the direct ability to plug the pump into the CPU_FAN header, which is only beneficial to actively detect if the pump fails (falls below X rpm) and the computer would then shutdown.To counter that, Chips/CPU's(motherboards) today are designed to shutdown at X degree's celcius to prevent damaging your CPU (ALL motherboards have this feature now).. so having the pump into the CPU_FAN header is NOT a must."," I gave this 5 ""eggs"" -- even with the small issue(s) i had.. which were BOTH a bracket that didn't fit properly, and a product that was made just a few months ago (Fall of 2013)  that still had the pump make a slight noise when plugged into a motherboard header.  (In all odds I could have gone into my ASUS UEFI bios and moved that fan header to maximum RPM at all times and the header would have likely stopped the pump noise.I wanted to put my push/pull (2 noctua) fans on the radiator on the CPU_FAN header for monitoring purposes anyways, so the Pump going to the PSU directly is quite comfortable with me.The bracket is custom fit for my motherboard now.. and the cooling temps are on par with what the cooler should do.. so I am a happy camper.Essentially -- Intel Haswell i7-4770k Oc'd to 4.8Ghz on the H60 is running at 29c Idle, and 70c under ""Stress tests"" -- This actually exceeded my expectations of the H60,.. I expected such a High clock with the haswell to push 85c or so under Stress tests.. Definitely a recommended Buy, though I would keep an eye out for specials on it.. if you can grab it for $10 off or so , it's always nice.  But, that said at $80.. it's worth the money.  It's a watercooling system.. fairly sophisticated method of cooling any electronic device.Installation is straight forward, but give yourself some time.  For those who aren't naturally good with their hands/savvy technically you may need 45mins-hour to properly install it.  Otherwise, install time is about 10-15mins, especially if you've ever used a Water cooling product of any sort before.",11,11

Quite pump, and acceptably quiet stock fan. Fits easily in my case.", Factory installed thermal paste-see below.You can get it in any color as long as you get black. Corsair should strive to make the adjustable motherboard back plate function a bit more obvious. (As in point it out in the instruction manual!)," All in all I was pleasantly surprised with the H60. The pump is shockingly silent. Installation was a breeze on my LGA1150 i7-4790 and MSI Z97 Mate Mainboard. As for the other reviews complaining about intel backplate issues- IT IS ADJUSTABLE! The four female threaded anchors slide to adapt to your processor type.I won't knock a star for the factory thermal paste. I should but its industry standard and can't be helped.. As opposed to those that swear factory issue pre-applied paste is a bad product, my complaint is that there is far too much surface area covered on the heat block. Good news is a swab and some 70% isopropanol knocks it right off. Easily replaced with the proper coverage by the old standby arctic silver. Now to the good stuff:My system running the stock intel heatsink/fan combo often spiked to 75-78C while running CPU intensive software (particularly DA:Inquisition). It consistently ran at about 50C+/- @ ambient temp of 22C. At idle, right around 40C.While not too high, I got tired of keeping my man cave cold and having to wear a hoodie to protect my investment.So I installed the H60 in less than 30 minutes, fired up the beast, and let it run idle for just an hour. Then I put it through its paces. I ran multiple benchmarking programs, Ran Titanfall and DA:Inquisition AND Skyrim all at the same time and let it sit for an hour. Then just to be overly thorough, I turned on a space heater and warmed the room up to 29.5C and let the beast run with previously mentioned software all going.Using RealTemp, Corsair LINK, MSI Command Center and HPmonitor, I can confirm the highest CPU temp logged was 50C on Core 1, 49 on 2,46 on 3 and 44 on 4.CPU temps at both ambient temperatures, both tested for an hour never went above 32C.As we used to say at Raytheon: ""Good enough for government work.""Highly recommended product. Excellent value. Easy installation if one pays attention.Will review again after a month's use and abuse.",1,1

I ensured the the pump was operating at 100% capacity, and I did as Corsair recommended and used their included fan and configured it to pull air into the radiator from outside the case.Temps were high and I even tried turning the fan up to 100%, but it made little difference in temps and only created a ton of noise.There is nothing that I can find that I did wrong that would cause temps to be so much higher, but I got fed up and put the ZALMAN back on and returned the Corsair.", I would recommend the ZALMAN CNPS9500 over the Corsair H60 to anyone wondering what to get over their stock cooler.,None,None

It is not made clear where you should attach the pump for power: variable power fan header or?

Simple enough to fix: I attached the pump to a power supply lead, and fan to the CPU fan header.The included instructions really should be clear on this point.

Also a huge negative is that there is no clear cut answer on which way to mount the fan (exhaust or intake). I currently have it on as intake (air blowing into the radiator) but if the purpose of radiator is to force heat out, then I apparently I need to switch it to exhaust.

I'd say it's cheap but it doesn't even achieve that.," Poor cooling, awkward design, incorrect installation instructions, and then it dies in a year. It's also a dust magnet and requires almost weekly cleaning."," I initially gave this a good review. I have to withdraw that. This thing is horrid. It failed after a little over a year. The pump stopped working. I purchased an Intel RTS2011AC, the ""stock"" cooler for an i7-3930K to use while it was in for warranty. I was horrified when the tiny fan and heat sink so drastically out performed this fancy water cooling system.The Corsair cooler never got the CPU cooler than around 55c. Full load it would run over 75c. The stock Intel cooler idles at 40c and Full load never exceeds 65c. Basically 10 to 15c cooler across the board. Sad. No wait, pathetic!If you're after ""quiet"" it fails there too. The stock cooler is actually quieter, probably because the fan is further inside the case instead of right on the back.Somehow the Corsair collects dust like nothing I've ever seen. In about 2 weeks time the entire surface of the radiator is covered in a layer of dust that resembles felt. You can actually peel it off like fabric. Granted it's easy enough to remove but you need to do it ever couple of weeks. I don't want to be cracking the case every week or two. I have more important work to do.The installation instructions direct you to install this so the fan draws air IN from the back of the case. The theory being that that will be cool, outside air. Unfortunately in practice that's not what happens. The air it's drawing is mostly the hot exhaust from the GPU and PSU. Installed like that you'll be lucky to get the CPU below 80c. At idle. Don't even try to load it you'll get an over temp shutdown.Corsair is going to replace it but frankly I don't even want the replacement. It's is drastically inferior to a stock cooler in every way. It costs more, cools less, just as noisy (if not louder) and isn't reliable. I suppose the biggest question is how did Corsair manage to do so little with so much hardware.",0,6

During gaming, I was getting temps around  40-50 Celsius. These temps are pretty outstanding for the price of this cooler and I think Corsair did a great job. Keep in mind, however, that I haven't owned many coolers in the past so I can't offer you all any comparisons. Installation of the cooler on an LGA1150 board was pretty simple.

I had to go into my BIOS and change my sys_fan1 header's power to full, since be default it was set to 'normal' which was a variable power setting.  Once I had it configured correctly, I ran Prime95 small FFTs on it for a while, and it maxed out at 55C.  And when I stopped the test, the core temps went immediately back down to idle temps (~22C).  And when I say immediately, I don't mean a quick regression over several seconds - I mean in 1 second it was all the way down.",0,1

Long story short, there was a leak in the pump and the fluid had drained out, the wining noise was the pump running dry and the gurgling was the air bubbles. Thankfully the fluid inside was non-conductive so my pc is not fried. I'm currently in the process of trying to see about the warranty.

Used on a AMD FX-8320 Vishera 8-Core 3.5GHz (4.0GHz Turbo).As someone mentioned before if you don't have your stock CPU mounts that came with your mobo you will be in trouble and will have to find a computer parts store and see if they have one in stock.  Mounted this onto a ASUS M5A99X EVO R2.0 mobo.I had an Scythe SCMG-2100 Sleeve CPU Cooler before which ran temps into the 70c's.  It was huge and super hard to install.  This Corsair is really easy to install.  Took me 10 minutes and this is only my second computer build.  Performed Cpuid CPU stress test:    Stressed for 10 minutes and held at 49c.     Idel temp is 31c.Overall really excited about this Hydro Series and I'm sold... never going back to tradition methods.

Only issue is that the included thermal paste is sub-par, as it cools less effectively than stock cooling mounted with Arctic Silver 5:With an i7-2600 (95W TDP) [ Idle - 100% load ] [ Ambient temp ~27C ] Stock Cooling with Arctic Silver 5:38C - 63CH60 with included paste:41C - 73CH60 with Arctic Silver 5:35C - 58CLooking at these numbers the cooler isn't too much better than stock cooling - so why would someone spend more than 100$ after taxes and shipping for it? Because it's far, FAR quieter than stock cooling; the numbers for the H60 are with the lowest fan speed settings, as my original reason for this purchase was silence; in this sense it has succeeded - stock cooling under load was insanely loud, whereas the H60 under load is a very quiet rush of air.Lastly, the included fan is noticeably loud at max speed (which it won't need to hit to keep things cool anyway), but this is expected of a non-premium fan (ie Noctua NF-F12).",3,3

Plus, the colored ring on the pump matches the heatsinks on the Z78 Gryphon motherboard, so it looks awesome! I also like that the fans don't plug into the pump and can instead be controlled via a fanbus or the motherboard headers themselves."," Stock fans are a bit on the loud side, also, the radiator is a bit thicker than the other corsair units. I was unable to mount mine in the top of my Corsair 350D case, but it went into the front just fine. Probably better there, anyway. I do get some pump noise, though, at startup. Since the pump is higher than the radiator, it seems small air bubbles are collecting there when it's powered off.

During Battlefield 4 my CPU temp would get up to 54C with the push/pull fans almost maxed out. I recently upgraded to a Corsair 650D case and decided to purchase the H105 since this case will allow for up to a 280mm radiator to be installed. Installation is a breeze with this product. I just had to snap of the retention ring and change out the bracket to fit my AM3+ motherboard, install the fans (push exhaust for me), mount the radiator/fans in case, install screw standoffs on OEM back plate, seat the pump/block unit, screw on thumb screws snug, plug in pump and fans, and away we go.I ran AMD Overdrive stability test and CPU temp only got up to 47C with fans set to ""silent"" in BIOS. During Battlefield 4 temps only got up to 49C max! That's 5C lower than with the H55 I was using! Awesome! I can hardly hear these Corsair fans working."," The only downside is the cost, but I guess you get what you pay for."," I plug the 3-pin pump into the CPU fan header on my Sabertooth 990FX and the fans in the CPU optional fan header with a Y splitter (included). Since the pump is 3-pin the Q-Fan control won't affect it, only the PWM cooling fans (4-pin). I do this just in case the pump fails the BIOS will detect and notify on boot up. Works like a charm.One thing you have to make sure is that your case has about 63mm of room between its ceiling and the motherboard. This is a 38mm thick radiator and the fans are 25mm thick.

Running two Noctua NF-F12 PWM fans connected to CPU fan port on my mobo; I adjust their speed with ASUS Fan Xpert.Corsair provides the right screws to run the fans/radiator in push configuration.  Thank you Corsair!"," Uses OEM backplate, but must use the provided screws. When first installing with OEM backplate and their screws, the backplate was loose, but once I mounted the water block to the CPU and tightened it down, everything was nice and tight.  38mm thick radiator plus 25mm thick fans may cause space problems for some people. No Corsair Link and no pump speed adjustment may be a con for some."," This is the BEST CPU cooler I've used for my FX-8350.  I run at 4.6GHz @ 1.425 vcore and it idles at 37 C. Far Cry 3 runs at a whopping 65 C but holds stable. These temps are from ASUS FanXpert, reading from BIOS, not the bogus readings everyone gets from CoreTemp and such on their FX-8350. These are the best temps I've seen so far. I thought my Noctua's would be better but learned AFTER installation that the included Corsair fans spin up to 2,700rpm and offer more than 3.1 mmH2O static pressure! Too lazy to change out to the included fans for now, so I cannot comment on their performance.Overall this product is an absolute knockout!

This on the other hand has given a huge diffrence.TempsDuring summer, my idle temps were around 15C on idle, and 25C MAX on full load.During Winter, 11C seems to be the lowest it will go on idle, and 20C on full load. InstallationInstillation was moderate at the most. Some of the pictures did not demonstrate well on how to install some of the brackets, and forced me to reference some videos. Did not want to install wrong and kill my system.Thermal PasteThe pre-applied thermal paste is noting to laugh at like some other companies. It is very durable and applied nicely.DesignThe design can be a bit annoying at times, due the the large radiator. When i say large i mean large, 38mm thick. That even caused some issue when installing on a NZXT Phantom 530, and that thing is beyond huge!. Other then that the tubes just need to be played with more then the average to compensate with the large radiator, but this is manageable. The fans can be noisy when set to max RPM's but are better than like 80% of fans so no big.In The BoxThis product come with an immense amount of diffrent screws that will work with nearly all cases which is a big plus! Love when companies give you the extra.

The maximum I've seen was 50 degrees on the 3dmark Physics Test on Fire Strike.Thermal paste seems to be very good, had no problem at all with it.It is very silent!  Now, about this, I've seen a lot of reviews saying silent and a lot of reviews saying loud.  Make sure you insert the fans' 4pin into the right location.  For example, my motherboard has lots of locations for the fans, so I decided I would put one in the Chassis_2_fan and one in the Optional_2_fan.  Well, that was a mistake.  Apparently one of the fan was running at maximum the whole time and it was very loud.  When I changed it and put both at the Chassis_2_fan location (how the guide suggests), the computer got a lot more silent, but of course the same loudness when the CPU is very stressed and the fan need to go fast (rarely in my case)."," It doesn't fit in many cases?

No coolant/reservoir needed.Lowered my temps from air cooling maybe 2-3 degrees,Celsius."," LOUD. The stock fans are atrocious. Yes, they'll lower the temps a couple degrees lower than before, but it sounds like a jet engine taking off. Couldn't hear myself talk to a friend a few feet away. Replaced them with a couple of 120mm fans I had lying around and it's much quieter, but I'll need to get some better, more efficient fans down the road.The backplate also doesn't work well with my motherboard (Asrock Z77 Extreme4). It won't seat correctly and makes contact with the CPU not as flush, no matter what I do."," All-in-all, it's an ok unit if you replace the fans and have everything seating perfectly, but it's not worth the price imo.",2,6
N82E16835181060,35-181-060,12/31/2014 12:25:26 PM,Bruce K.,Great Quiet CPU Cooler,5," - Water cooling without the fuss of having to build a custom loop.- Typical Corsair quality, at least from my experience with their components.- Corsair logo on the water block lights up, nice aesthetics for my build.- Keeps my Core i7 3770K at stock frequency nice and cool, core temps idle around 25C to 27C and none of the cores get much past 46C with a load on the CPU, and that's with the radiator fans rotating a little over 400 RPM.- Very silent operation.- Thicker radiator than the H100i. PWM fans and the unit comes with a splitter for the fan wires, so there's no need for unnecessary Corsair LINK software to muck things up.- Simple installation, no messy and unnecessary LINK wires like the H100i.- Hard plastic fixtures that secure the send/return lines to the radiator and water block, so there's no real dry rot concerns that I can foresee (see other thoughts)."," This is not a fault of the unit itself, it's my own bungling, but just want to throw this out there; be careful when trying to swap out the color ring on the water block. It kinda sucked that the flat head screwdriver that I used to pry up the default silver ring put a nice scratch in the paint (or whatever it is that's used on the top of the block where the Corsair logo is) and now light shines through it. I had just pulled the unit out of the box and didn't even have it mounted in the PC yet. Grrrrrr..."," This unit replaced a Corsair H100i. With all due respect to Corsair, that H100i turned out to be a huge disappointment for me due to the LED in the water block burning out after two months, the LINK software wouldn't recognize the radiator fans after about 6 months, so I couldn't control the fan speeds properly anymore, and lastly, after about 1 year of use, the rubber fixtures that secure the send/return lines to the radiator began dry-rotting and cracking. That made me a bit nervous, the last thing I needed was for that thing to spring a leak all over my motherboard and video cards.So, I figured I'd play it safe and went with the H105 to replace it. I also replaced the stock fans with two Corsair SP120 Silent Edition fans because I wanted the lowest RPMs/most silent operation possible. I already had these fans from replacing the H100i stock fans, therefore I can't really vouch for the operational silence of the fans that come with this unit. However, assuming they're the same fans that come with the H100i, they should perform relatively quietly if you keep them at lowest RPM possible.Hopefully this H105 lasts longer than my H100i did.",1,1

N82E16835181060,35-181-060,11/5/2014 7:45:09 PM,Matthew M.,Almost perfect,4," I was using a Corsair H60 before, which worked very well with my Phenom II x4 965. However when I upgraded to my FX-8350 earlier this year it would have trouble keeping it under control even with dual fans in push/pull, especially during the summer when the ambient temperatures would hover around 80°F. Unfortunately I was using an Antec Twelve Hundred, which is a great air cooling supertower, but can only mount one 120mm radiator. So, Newegg had the Corsair C70 on sale AND rebate at the same time, so I took the plunge and bought it as well.The H105 came well packaged, and it took only a couple of minutes to swap the stock AMD bracket with the standoffs, and faceplate on the cooling pump to the AMD one. The motherboard was out of the case at the time, but as it uses the stock AMD backplate, even an in case swapover would be easy. The flexible tubing does give a bit more peace of mind when setting it up that you're not going to cause a leak. I attached it to the top of the C70, with the fans drawing air from inside the case. I had my processor overclocked already, but would run in the upper 50°C range when even under gaming load, with it hovering between 60-62°C under video encoding load. With the H105 it stays at or under 41°C under gaming load, and tops out at 55°C under Prime95 In Place Large FFT 8 thread torture test."," I have one major complaint about this product, and it is the reason for the 4 egg rating, is that the fans Corsair ship with it, though effective at moving air, have a very loud bearing noise (hum or roar) similar to a ball bearing sound when the speed is over 50%. Thankfully I had the two Cougar CF-V12GP 120mm fans (Newegg Item#: N82E16835553002) which I swapped on. They move just as much air, but even at 100% are very quiet, with only an airflow-through-a-radiator sound and no bearing noise. I'm not sure if the fans I got were defective, but they were unusable."," I had debated between the H105 and H110i, and, though they were the same price, several review sites show the H105 cools a couple of degrees better than the H110i. The 110i has more connectivity features, but I see a couple of degrees better performance superior to coolant temperature monitoring.",2,4

My intention was to mount the radiator in the top of the case, using the included fans and the case's top fans for a push-pull configuration.  Well, from the top of the case, the hoses are not long enough for the contact plate/pump to reach over the GPU to the CPU, no matter which way the radiator is oriented.  Fortunately, the case DOES include 120mm/240mm mounts on the bottom - not just 140mm/280mm, and I had another pair of 120mm Corsair fans already, so I was able to set up the push-pull configuration there.  Unfortunately, this means having to order a new pair of fans (the ones I grabbed WERE being used elsewhere), less air intake from the bottom (2x120mm instead of 2x140mm), and just a lot of screwing around to find out that the hoses wouldn't reach from the top of the case to the CPU.Had I known ahead of time that I wouldn't be able to mount the radiator in the top of the case, installation would have been simple, and the cooler would have ALMOST had 5 eggs.  The fact that the fans are so loud, with no software control, means I haven't really achieved anything in replacing my previous watercooling kit, which still prevents me from giving the kit a full 5 eggs.",0,2

On the different fan in new box.At this point I was MAD, since I have to take out motherboard, replace the fans and it's SUCH a long process of about 2 hours to do. Like building computer from scratch. Got the third box of H105, decided to JUST test the fans before I take out the radiator and 2nd Corsair replacement.YEEEEEEP, same issue. The fans rock in the pulse (if you get a bad one like I did TWICE) and it will destabilize already messed up bearing to make rattling noise sooner or later. Fans push A LOT of air as I can feel, but built like Chinese toys. So...no 4th try for me. Buying Noctua NF-P12-1300 120mm Case Fans, and FORGET IT.This is RIDICULOUS!!!! Corsair dang, your fans SUCK....as I had bad experience with their SP120s too.if you are fine with a rattling jet engine (keyword rattling), you probably won't mind, but I have a problem with fans being defective out of the box. 3 times in the row. Low quality bearing for sure."," Great cooling, fans so bad make you wanna slap the s out quality control group. Good pump.I would give the Corsair H105 a 5 if the fans did not break within 15 days of use in my case. Then got replaced with another box, that already had an issue (and it was BRAND NEW), and 3rd time to find fans doing the same thing.These fans are CLEARLY not made to be in vertical position. Meh...I would give it 5, but NO WAY.Should be 30 bucks less just because of this.",4,5

Using prime95 to max all cores I can reach temps of about 45c, but when turning my fans up beyond 1600rpm the temp quickly falls back to 42/43c and stays there. Using fan profiles in Fan Expert the H105 provides near silent cooling. Not much else I can ask for.  Setup was super easy using the supplied mounting ring. The fans perform quite well. They move way more air than the nzxt fans previously in my case. They are also much quieter. I did not install the color rings, but if you want there are blue and red rings to color match the fans with your case accessories. Mounting the radiator took a little longer than expected.

Corsair has great customer service.Keeps the temps out of the 80s on my 3770k @ 4.5GHz 1.2v. And thats only long stress test runs. Most loads hover in the 50-60c range. Not bad for an Ivy that is not delidded. Been running about seven months now and no leaks or any other failures to speak of.You can probably get this kind of performance out of a high-end air solution, but you wind up with over a kilogram of metal hanging off of the CPU socket. I move my computer around enough for LANs that its probably a good idea to avoid such solutions."," Although my HAF XM has the perfect spot in the top for a dual-140 radiator, the screw holes didn't quite line up. I believe the assumed spacing between the fans is off so that only one fan could be mounted properly. I used a dremel to widen the holes in my case and everything fits now.The fans I received made a rattling sound when mounted hub-down (exhaust upwards out of the top of the case). Corsair RMA'd me a new set and they had the same problem. They work fine when blowing sideways so I now use them in the side panel and bought a pair of Akasa Vipers for the radiator up top."," Overall a good experience considering the level of convenience offered from a performance product.I wont dock an egg due to the screw holes in the case not lining up. Radiators this size are somewhat new territory, and in all likelyhood the newer cases will just use wider screw hole 'slots' to accommodate these variabilities - exactly how I dremel'd mine. I wont dock an egg for the fans either. To be fair the install guide recommends against using the fans in the method I was and yet Corsair was more than willing to help address the issue. I would have bought more fans for the side panel anyways, so this didn't change thing much in the scheme of things.",1,1

Runs silently with my choice of fans.Of course it fits my Corsair 900D case perfectly.," Completely worthless fans. Trash 'em and get another set. For the price, Corsair should've included their best fans, which would've been perfect.I used 4 of the latest Swiftech fans. Silent running and good looking.The 1st cooler had a leak that I noticed before install so I RMA'd it. Not typical of Corsair but these things happen.Lack of lights and Link software function is a bonus, since I've heard nothing but complaints about it.It should come with at least one 2-way fan splitter cable. Preferably 2 and mounting screws for 4 fans since most people will run it as push/pull with 4 fans.As always with any Corsair product, the installation instructions are worthless. Had to Google some proper instructions for install. Corsair doesn't even say how to properly run this cooler. It does run as plug and play, but, it doesn't run optimally. It definitely needs a good fan controller and luckily I had a spare."," Even as is, it's well worth the price.Corsair on-line RMA is confusing at best and mostly worthless. Use the Corsair Forum with the RamGuy for the most excellent service extant.Those thin, black washers for mounting the fans are extremely important. Do NOT forget to use them!If you want to run 4 fans, just take a mounting screw and washer to your local hardware store and they'll match them perfectly.I did NOT buy this cooler as a permanent solution. It's just used for testing new motherboards before I build my own, complete, custom loop.If you want to use just this cooler you'll be perfectly happy with it as a permanent solution.As always with any type of watercooling system, immediately shut it down if you ever notice a single drop of coolant leak and see what's wrong.

9SIA6ZP3K32295,35-181-035,4/5/2013 5:58:50 PM,Anonymous,One month post review,5," This is my third review of the H110.  The first one was the original and exhaustive EggXpert Review, and the second one was to outline that performance could be improved by hooking up the fans and heat pump head to  different locations.  This third review takes into account a further fan hookup change, and the use of the best TIM I have come across in my 22 years of building PCs.My rating is now upgraded to 5 eggs.  The reason for this is that Corsair has improved their information regarding case compatibility and that information has also flowed to Newegg.  All original Pros still stand.", The original con I pointed out is now retracted.  This being the lack of necessary documentation to head off confusion about case compatibility.," In my quest to get to the maximum performance from this cooler, I made some additional changes:1.  I am now using Prolimatech PK-3 TIM.  This is hands down the best TIM I have ever used.  I originally utilized Tuniq TX-2, and then also tried Arctic Cooling MX-4.  They performed identically and are good TIMs in their own right.2.  I purchased a PWM adapter cable.  After doing some fiddling and fighting with my Gigabyte motherboard, I finally came to the conclusion that to run this cooler at it's best you need use a PWM splitter with either a MOLEX or SATA power adapter to power the fans.  I purchased an Akasa PWM splitter from another etailer, where they have ...frozen... in their name. The way it is hooked up now is there is a single PWM cable hooked up to the CPU_FAN header.  It does NOT draw power from the header and only provides PWM feedback.  This branches off to two PWM fan connectors that the cooler fans are hooked up to.  The cable also supplies power to the cooler fans via a SATA connection although you can get them with MOLEX connections as well.  This makes sure that the motherboard is not trying to supply power to two 1500RPM 140mm fans from one header.  I set my CPU_FAN profile in the Gigabyte BIOS to PWM, and then fan speed control to Manual, at the highest slope profile.  This will vary the fan speeds between a measured 800 RPM and 1500RPM based upon CPU temp.  The heat pump head is still hooked into a 3-pin power distribution panel and powered directly via the PSU, where the BIOS has no influence over it.With the Prolimatech PK-3 TIM I get the following results:Ambient air temp is 75 deg F.Temps are per RealTemp.IDLE:  23 deg CLOAD: 57 deg CThe test was done using the Gigabyte ""multi-core enhancement"" which is activated in the BIOS by simply setting Intel Turbo Boost to AUTO as opposed to Enabled.  If one core goes to 3.9GHz, they all do.  It should be noted that the fan hookup changes did not result in the new temps dropping as much as they did.  It was the new TIM that I attribute that to.  After I had made the fan hookup changes I saw a 1 deg C drop from my previous reported results under idle and load whether it was the MX-4 or TX-2 used.  Once I switched to PK-3 that is when the real drops occurred, and that is what I am reporting here.  I did allow a 12 hr break-in for the TIM, although Prolimatech advises this is not necessary.Prime95 27.7 ""In-Place Large FFTs"" was the test used, for a 25 minute run, all 8 threads loaded.My rig:Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD3H, F18 BIOSCrucial Ballistix Tactical DDR3-1866 9-9-9-27, 8 GB, 1.5VCore i7-2700KCorsair H110 water coolerSamsung 830 SSD, 256GBEVGA FTW nVidia GTX 670 video cardWD Blue 1TB as mass storageSound Blaster Z sound cardASUS DVD/RWSeasonic X-Series 650W, Gold Certified modular PSULogitech G400iOne X-Armor Cherry MX Brown mechanical keyboardKlipsch Promedia 2.1 system and Razor ORCA cansWindows 7 64bit OEMView",13,14

(could have used some standoffs)Feeble instruction booklet not detailed enough.," This cooler is huge, the mother of CPU coolers. It of course is water cooled and the radiator is about a eleven inches long and five inches wide. When I opened my computer case I noticed that I had no place to mount the radiator. You have to have a case that has room for two adjacent five inch fans exiting the case, mine did not. But the computer is in my man cave so I decided to mount it externally. Luckily the case has a top fan so I cut out part of the grill large enough to slip through the CPU pump head since the hoses cannot be disconnected. So I was all set to mount the radiator on top of my tower. Next, there is a backplate needed for the mount so I had to remove the motherboard to install the backplate. I darn near gave up at this point since the holes didn't seem to be lining up. There are three holes in each corner of the backplate with the socket numbers molded into the plastic. My CPU is the 1155 socket, so I installed the ""t"" nuts into the hole marked ""1155"". Simple enough but when it is mounted it is crooked on the back of the motherboard to make it fit. Not a problem, but I assumed that it would be square with the socket. So don't give up, it will fit, it is just made that way to accommodate three different sockets. Next I installed the retention ring before re-installing the motherboard so the backplate wouldn't get knocked off during installation. (it is stuck on with double sided tape but why take a chance) Putting the plastic inserts on the retention ring turned out to be a brain teaser too. The bottom half does not fit into the retention channel it just clips to the upper half and rides on the edge of the turned up metal. Also, the ring is slotted so the inserts can be installed two different ways to line up with your socket holes. The picture in the installation booklet does not give a very clear picture of how they go together. Once the motherboard was re-installed, I ran the pump head through my hole in the top of my tower and mounted it onto the processor. The thumb screws are top notch and the mount is very secure. I mounted the radiator on top using some spacers to leave about an inch of space between the top of the case and the bottom of the radiator. I put the fans on top. If you want a real neat setup, you should get a case that is compatible with the radiator, if you download the quick start guide there is a picture of an internal mount. I like the way my externally mounted radiator looks, it is in my man cave and it looks kind of like the Borg built it.",2,3
9SIA6ZP3K32295,35-181-035,3/17/2013 2:49:41 PM,Michael R.,The BEST Water Cooling Solution for the Serious OverClocker,5, Large Radiator and Fans work to cool down the most extreme overclocked processors out there. Price point is good for the quality that you get., Unit is huge. Case compatibility is going to be an issue. Case and H110 must match to work correctly. Fans are louder than other units. H110 must be solidly and evenly mounted to keep fan noise and vibration from large fans to a minimum. Motherboard must have enough fan headers to support the pump unit and both fans since both fans have to have PWM 4 pin headers.," Since I have been working with computers and repairing and building computers for close to twenty years now, I do a few water cooled units here and there for friends that are seriously into gaming.  When the Corsair H110 came up for review, I wanted to get my hands on one to test as I built a new water cooled gaming rig for friend at Christmas using a Corsair 900D Case with an H90 water cooler.His system is the 900D case, the H90 Corsair cooler/radiator, Intel I-7 3770K running at 4.8Ghz, and an ASUS Maximus V Extreme Z77 motherboard.Needless to say, when asked what I wanted to use his system to test, he was all for it.  So I spent a few hours carefully removing everything I needed to remove from the case, and installing the H110 cooler unit.  It fit like a glove in the 900D.  I got his system back up, using Prolimatech PK-1 thermal compound as the TIM.After letting everything run for about a week, and my bud doing his normal gaming, we ran the temp tests using Prime 95 running at his full 4.8 Ghz overclocked speed. The results compared to the H90 were very,very good. With the H110, idle temp was 22 degrees Celcius, and load temp was only 56 degrees Celcius.  The H90 had an idle temp of 25 degrees Celcius, and load temp of 63 degrees. This is a solid 7 degree Celcius improvement over an already good running H90 equipped system.Overall, I am very pleased with the results of the test, and the quality of the Corsair H110 cooler.  Now, not everyone is going to need a cooler like this, only the extreme overclocker is going to put it to its full use.  Most of us will never need any more than standard air cooling, but it is nice to know that excellent quality, leak resistant units like this are out there if we should want to try them.Unlike some who tested the unit, this particular setup had no fan vibration or buzzing from the fans, that could be due to being installed in the 900D case which has more than enough room without having to do a lot of mods. Still, the fans are a little noisier than the fans that come on the H90 Corsair unit, but given the amount of air that they move, and the additional cooling they offer, my friend has no problem with them the way they are.I rate the H110 a solid 5 Egg top of the line water cooling system and fully recommend it to anyone who is a serious overclocker to buy.",9,13
9SIA6ZP3K32295,35-181-035,3/16/2013 10:24:43 PM,Christopher R.,"Awesome, but probably overkill for most applications",4," Sometimes, you just need a bigger hammer. I've always preferred good air cooling to other solutions, and I haven't been let down all that often. Despite the attractive closed loop, self contained coolers out there,  air is still the way to go for most users. Most, but not all. There are times when you need something with a bit more juice, and the H110 certainly fits that bill.The H110 is a simple package, consisting of the 280mm radiatior/pump head, two 140mm fans, and some mounting hardware. The entire setup is well thought out, and while I didn't try out every platform mounting system, setup for LGA 2011 is supremely easy. Just snap the retention and mounting rings together over the pump head and thumb-screw in to the socket threads. Assuming the radiator and fans are easily mountable with your case, you're good to go. In my scenario I had a bit more trouble, but it wasn't the H110s fault. I was putting the H110 on an open air test bench, and the radiator's dimensions clashed a bit. I found a good work around, but you should really use the H110 with a good modern case with lots of airflow anyway. Depending on what cooling setup you were previously using, you might not be getting the right amount of airflow over the socket area and VRMs.I think it's worth pointing out that the fans are quite good too. Some previous Corsair Hxx systems I've encountered had fans with less than awesome characteristics, but I find the two that shipped with my H110 are quiet at lower RPMs (~900RPM) and don't sound awful at full-tilt (1500RPM). But how does it perform? All told, better than I was expecting. I did most of my testing with a i7-3930k, and at stock clocks the H110 is enough to keep the CPU idling in the mid 20's, even with the fans turning rather slowly. So, how does it perform?My i7-3930k clocked at 4.7GHz (@1.4v) idles at: H110 -- Cores 1 through 6:  Idle:   32c 31c 14c 30c 30c 23c (CPU T sensor: 28c)Load:   65c 62c 50c 63c 64c 64c (CPU T sensor: 51c)All in all, temps are kept well in check with a heavy overclock. At stock clocks, 100% load, the H110 keeps the 3930k at temps on parity with some air coolers at idle. I've been using a high end dual tower HSF with dual 140mm/120mm fans. It weighs a ton and dwarfs the socket area on a X79 board. At the same fan speed (1500RPM), this is what I get with the same 1.4v/4.7GHz using it:Air  -- Cores 1 through 6:  Idle:   43c 42c 29c 42c 39c 34c (CPU T sensor: 34c)Load:   77c 72c 65c 73c 72c 74c (CPU T sensor: 58c)That's a massive difference. Core 3 is as much as 15c hotter, but on average we're running 72c on air vs. 62c on the H110 after 30 mins of load testing, at similar noise levels."," The H110 does probably beat the best the air cooling world has to offer, but it gets progressively harder to justify based solely on performance. Only you can decide whether it's a good value or not, but I suppose it largely depends on whether you already have a case that supports a 280mm radiator. Even if you do, there are some motherboard setups which might not leave much slack in the tubing from head to radiator, so do your research ahead of time. In terms of installation, it's super easy, as simple or better than most air solutions."," Do you really need something like the H110? Probably not if you're using an 1155 CPU. If you're using an X58/X79 or AMD Phenom/Bulldozer platform, this might be a good option if you already have the case to mount it in (or, if you're putting together a whole new system). On an absolute cost per degree of cooling basis, it's hard to justify. In terms of ease of installation, it's hard to beat, and in overall quality it seems to be better put together than some of the older self contained systems I've used. For me, even if it weren't a better cooler, I still like it just for the fact that I have easy access to the socket area. That might not sound like much, but when you swap components out as much as I do, it's a great thing to have.",4,5
9SIA6ZP3K32295,35-181-035,3/15/2013 7:02:52 AM,Harold B.,Big and basic,4, Simple and effective.  One wire from the pump to the cpu fan header and nothing else.  Cooling a 3570k at 4.4 running Prime95 for 10 hours and the hottest core hit 71c.  Compared to the EVO I was using in push/pull same bios settings hit 87c in 90 minutes.," Bracket assembly to mount cold plate to the motherboard is very unusual and cheap.  75% of those parts are plastic and flimsy.  The Corsair H60 (2013 model) I used a few months ago had much better mounting parts.  The back plate sits crooked and bends around components on the back of your board.  You also can't orientate the beauty plate like you can on the other corsair models.  That means if you want the ""CORSAIR"" logo to read upright the hoses will come out of the right side of the block."," Using a Corsair Vengeance C70....fits up top only and if you want the hoses off the radiator to run from right to left you'll need to bend a useless bracket a bit.  Mounting the radiator with the hoses running left to right required normal installation.  The C70 will not accept the radiator in a push/pull configuration.  Not enough space between the motherboard and the top of the case.  This means you'll want the fans on the inside pulling case air through the radiator and out of the top of the case.  With this setup CORSAIR doesn't include screws to mount the radiator to the case.  You'll need 8 screws, size 6/32 @ 3/8"" in length with washers.",2,5

Water pump is near silent when running at full speed., The fans are extremely loud at full RPM. For being 140mm I was expecting them to be near silent. Luckily I dont run them 100% all day and 40% is more than enough to keep my 2700k at 50c with gaming, I had a hyper 212 evo with push/pull before this h110 and it kills it when it comes to runnig prime. Temps with the 212 was around 75c at 4.5ghz and this is with hyper threading turned off. With HT on it would get into 85c territory. Now I can run HT at 5ghz with no issues with temps below 70cMy case is a Corsair 500R and the radiator wont fit on top of where you can rest a radiator. Instead I had to mount it under and have the fans on top with a push setup. To fit the radiator under I had to cut the tabs off the 8 pin CPU plug in order for it to fit. My motherboard is the Asrock extreme 4 and from looking at the pictures the CPU plug is at the very top and this prevents me from plugging in the CPU power.,1,3
9SIA6ZP3K32295,35-181-035,3/6/2013 7:14:40 PM,Anonymous,"Updated Review, Updated Temps",4," I found that more performance can be squeezed out of this Corsair H110 with some minor adjustments.  This is an update to my original EggXpert Review.  All other pros, including this new one, still stand.", All original cons still stand.  My rating won't change.," So, here is the deal.  I modified my system to remove the side 200mm intake fan.  I determined that it was disrupting airflow from the front 200mm intake fan.  I retested according to my original test methodology and my temps remained the same.  So, the 200mm side intake fan was of no benefit to me and only adding to any/all noise.The second modification I made had to do with how the Corsair H110 was hooked up to the fan headers on my motherboard.  My Gigabyte motherboard can be set for AUTO, VOLTAGE, or PWM control of the CPU_FAN header and the same for SYS_FAN headers.  Do to my install layout, I had the heat pump 3-PIN fan header hooked into a SYS_FAN header, and the 1st 140mm fan into the CPU_FAN header and the 2nd 140mm fan into another SYS_FAN header.  I noticed that if I disabled motherboard BIOS control for all headers that everything, including the pump head, ran at a measured 1500 RPM.  That is expected for the fans, as they max out there.  What took me by surprise is that the heat pump head measured at 1000 RPM before I disabled the fan speed control.  I do recall someone in the Corsair forum saying that the pump head should be registering at 1500 RPM regardless of the fan speeds and temps.  So, apparently my motherboard will selectively control each of the headers by PWM or VOLTAGE as it sees fit, even if the connector in question is 3-PIN.  With this in mind I left the two 140mm fans plugged where they were, set the fan control to AUTO in BIOS, and then hooked the heat pump head 3-PIN connector into a fan power distribution panel that I installed in my case.  My case fans run off of this panel as well (4 pin MOLEX to 3 X 3-PIN).  Since I removed the one 200mm fan I had room for one more.  Hooked up this way, the BIOS no longer has control of the heat pump.  Logically, it should run ""flat out"" at the correct 1500 RPM and it should also follow that I should see better temps.  I retested my system using Prime95 for a good 25 minute Blend Torture Test, and measured temps with Core Temp.  Ambient air temp remains the same (this is important to point out).The BIOS has the multi-core enhancement ENABLED (actually, the exact wording in the Gigabyte BIOS is Intel Turbo Boost Technology set to AUTO as opposed to Enabled) so therefore the results are based upon all cores running at 3.9 GHz when any one of them is at 100% load.Idle temp:  23 deg C (all four cores average)Load temp:  59 deg C (all four cores average)The idle and 100% load temps are reduced by 2 deg C each.  Not bad for messing around a little with fan connectors!Also, I need to make a correction to my original review...my CM HAF XM case will support 480mm total length radiators on top.  I probably caused some confusion when I referred to the H110 as 480mm as it is actually considered 280mm.  I mixed up the discussion point numbers when talking about case support.  Sorry for any confusion I caused on this point!",3,5

Hence  the increased memory multiplier.Went  from 3dmark P9278 to P9389 just on the increased memory clock.To be fair my h70  is a single 120 mm radiator so the differences will be less if you move from  a 240 mm radiator setup.,3,3
9SIA6ZP3K32295,35-181-035,3/6/2013 12:09:49 AM,B R.,Case modding will be likely!,5," If you own an Antec 1200 chassis, then you will want to know that this -WILL- fit into the top of an Antec 1200 chassis, but you have to be creative and willing to drill holes in the top of your chassis.See other thoughts for sizing suggestions.Actual pro's from an ""Utterly insane, extreme overclocker"" follow, I run my x58 i7 way above what most people would ever consider to be sane / safe for it.I'll give you a comparison before and after to give you an idea of the performance to expect from this cooling unit.System settings before water cooler:I7-950 Nehalem core, overclocked @ 4186mhz @ 1.468v cpu vcore, averaging 45c - 50c idle, and 89c - 94c under 100% load on all 8 threads.  I was using a Cooler master GeminII S heatsink with a 8000 rpm 92mm delta fan (on a fan controller, only put to full speed when cores were loaded to 100%).After installing this water cooler on cpu @ same settings: averaging 30c - 34c idle and maxed out at 71c load temps (loaded to 100% on all cores/threads).So that's a idle temp drop of about -16c, but a load temp drop of about -23c verses air cooling.  This is no small feat and pretty significant by most considerations.Besides all of this, (since I'm personally comfortable running my processor very hot) this water cooling unit has enabled me to push the processor up further to 4308mhz & 1.60v vcore, which now runs at a max of 89c - 91c under load.If you're in to absolutely nutty insane overclocking, this (massively large) radiator will definitely handle your extreme heat loads of the most demanding situations.Installed with the factory fans it is nearly completely silent.  This was my first experience with water cooling at all and I wish I had done this sooner years ago, the noise reduction is probably the best part."," The two cooler master factory fans started making a rather noticeable ""rattle"" noise at day #2 of usage.  I submitted an RMA with cooler master and they insist on my dismantling my computer and sending the entire unit back to them, fans, radiator, water block, and even the mounting bracket on the under-side of my motherboard.  I tried asking to just send the fans back but was told the entire unit must be returned as one.  This means an extra 12 hours of work just to replace the fans (which I can access with a screw driver without removing anything from my system), about 4-6 hours to disassemble enough of my system to remove the motherboard and then another 4-6 hours to re-assemble it when the replacement parts arrive.  This is just too much just to replace two fans (which I can access with a screw driver without removing anything else from my system), so I'll work out something on my own instead.I don't know if my experience is typical, but after suddenly having a totally silent system with this water cooler, it's very noticeable when the fans are ""rattling"" like this."," This will not fit in most computer cases!  Make sure you look at the actual physical dimensions listed on this page for the radiator.  DO NOT ASSUME that just because it mounts two 140mm fans that the radiator is therefore 280mm.  It in fact has portions of the radiator that extend an additional 15mm on either side (for a full 310mm length) and may make fitting in some locations difficult.Instead of pulling the entire system for RMA, I plan to just replace (upgrade!) the two fans with a pair of 140mm sleeve-bearing Yate Loon fans, likely 4 total for push-pull eventually, depending on how the first two work out, but for now just two.I have several pictures of how I figured out how to mount this in an Antec 1200 chassis and it may be useful to others wanting this cooler but also owning this chassis.  They're available on my DeviantArt page, just look on DA for user name ""AquaVixie"", it should be an obvious gallery there, also with full detailed specs of my entire system.Other thought:  After having air cooling with a loud fan for a little over 3 years in this system... I actually can hear my hard drives when they have activity for the first time.  It's a little un-nerving to hear them clatter suddenly and look at my computer when I hear the noise.  It's okay.. It's just something new to get used to.",3,4
9SIA6ZP3K32295,35-181-035,3/5/2013 11:02:01 AM,Anonymous,Be prepared to mod your case!,4," This is my first foray into water cooling, and I am pleased.  First, as with all of my reviews I begin with the unboxing and go from there.  Benchmarks are presented in the Other Thoughts section.  The box is large and everything is well protected.  In the box you have the two 140mm PWM fans (max speed of 1500 RPM), the radiator and heat pump assembly (both already attached to each other), mounting hardware for every type of AMD or Intel socket currently available, and there is pre-applied thermal interface material (TIM) that I did not use.  The pump itself requires a 3 pin fan header, and the two fans require one each PWM 4 pin fan headers.  A detailed instruction guide is included in multiple languages, and is adequate.  The box, cardboard inserts, etc. are all recyclable.  The unit has a five year warranty, which is longer than most others.  The all-in-one sealed system nature of this unit makes water cooling easy and the unit is guaranteed to never leak.  The Corsair H110 kept my CPU temps much lower than any air cooler I have used before and finally let me FINALLY feel comfortable enough to use the multi-core enhancement my Gigabyte motherboard allows.  Previously I always set the Intel Turbo Boost to Enabled in BIOS as this runs the processor within Intel specifications, where the cores are graduated in speed.  Multi-core enhancement skips the graduation and forces all cores to the maximum supported Turbo Boost speed, basically going from the idle of 1600 MHz to maximum in one shot.  This is overclocking by another name.  My game frame rates have increased and the system is more responsive!  The H110 system is SILENT when used with NORMAL PWM control in BIOS.  The fans run anywhere from 700 RPM to 1500 RPM depending upon CPU temps.  Installation was easy once I got past a relatively major issue of case compatibility, detailed in the Cons section.  I mounted the system per Corsair's recommendations of PUSH/PUSH where the fans are above the radiator and forcing air down through the radiator and into the case.  You have flexibility to try PUSH/PULL or PULL/PULL and also forcing the warm air out of your case—however this all depends on the case you are using.  The heat pump mounting mechanism itself attaches very firmly to the motherboard, and provides superior clamping pressure and is difficult to over tighten.  The hoses are flexible enough, and the they also pivot at the heat pump itself to avoid kinks and installation hassles.  Installation was more involved than a large air cooler with back plate, but not excessively so.  One of the biggest pros is the heat pump is no heavier than the default Intel cooler, which puts FAR less stress on your motherboard.  Ultra performance air coolers are ultra heavy and have always made me nervous during case movement.  Not so with the H110.  I strongly recommend this water cooling system IF your case supports it."," Case support is going to be an issue.  First, you have to be sure your case indeed supports 480mm radiators.  DO NOT assume that since you can mount two 140mm fans up top that you can use a 480mm radiator...you will be making a mistake.  That is the first hurdle.  This is information, not a con, but it does lead into the con that caused me to deduct an Egg.  Let me preface by saying I believe the product itself is spectacular.  I am happy to have it.  When the review unit was on the way to me I did my usual pre-review research to find out about a product and read through what I could.  I typically will visit the manufacturer's website to see what information they have and if I can download manuals or at least look at a FAQ.   1. Corsair has NO case compatibility chart, not even for their own cases.2. Corsair did not explain anywhere on their website that the fans are using 20mm spacing on the radiator; most of the industry is using 15mm spacing.  When I went to mount the system I found that four of the eight holes in my case did not line up.  Either the front lined up, or the rear did.  The other four holes were each off by 5mm.  This caused a trip to the hardware store to buy a circular file in order to cut back four of the holes to allow mounting.  Cooler Master could have elongated the holes in order to broaden compatibility, so it is somewhat Cooler Master's lack of foresight playing a role here.  To be clear, I am experienced and actually expected something like this to happen, and I don't consider this minor mod to be a big deal for me personally.  What is UNFORGIVEABLE on Corsair's part is there was no indication anywhere that someone might run into this.  Not everyone is a Newegg EggXpert reviewer with lots of experience.3. There is no documentation to download on this product on Corsair's website. Technical specifications listed are minimal.I have confirmed, via the Corsair *user forums*, that the H110 will fit in the following Corsair cases:900D650D500RC70The 650D and 500R will be a tighter fit and the motherboard used may pose clearance issues.  YOU must do your research.A big thanks to RAMGUY there for providing that.  However, the link providing this information was to another website entirely.

Coolant tubes are big, fat, and juicy yet really flexible and adaptable around bends.", The screw holes are misaligned? When both included 140mm fans are installed on the radiator there is an ~5mm gap between them. The gap doesn't bother me but it doesn't align with the holes on my Full Tower NZXT Phantom 820 case. So I only used 6 screws and mounted it like this : :: instead of : :: : which is still strong. My best guess is they designed it to accommodate other fans that may be slightly larger. Not worth it to take an egg off though., I have an i7-3770k on idle running between 25-28*C with this WC at 22*C ambient. And that's with no other fans running in the case. But then again I have a monster case. Also the thermal paste that comes on the cooling head is rubbish since it doesn't stay on either the cooling head or the cpu that well.

But grinding like they had been used for 5 years without any cleaning.  Horrible Horrible FANS!!!..."," Up till now I have been a hard core Corsair supporter until my last purchase.  I built a new machine from ground up.  And all but 1 of my Corsair branded items were defective in one way or another.  I ended up shipping most of it back and getting different branded items.  I will List below what I purchased from Corsair and what I ended up replacing it with.  In summary Corsiar has lost a customer.  I will no longer hold Corsair in high esteem.  They must have changed the manufacturing or moved it to a different country or facility but I've lost faith in them and will no longer purchase Corsair products. 1.) Corsair AXI series AX860I Power supply Issue:  The 24pin mother board cable would not stay plugged in and would creep out of the power supply itself.  Basically the plug itself was poorly manufacturerd.  Where the clip clips onto the power supply was straight and not angled so that it could latch on. Replaced with: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000 p3 80 plus Platinum 1000w PSULOVE IT!!!... KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK EVGA!!!...2.) Corsair Carbide Series Air 540:Video card would not bolt down without pulling the video card out of the slot.  Basically the case is built so cheaply that if you looked at the back it bowed outward from the case enough that the components would not bolt in.  The case would rock when sitting on a flat surface due to the cheap nature of this case.  Additionally the case side panel would not shut flush when reassembled.  Replaced with: Cooler Master Cosmos II... LOVE IT!!!... but one major MAJOR complaint on the Cosmos II... THE MOTHER BOARD SCREWS ARE HORRIBLE!!!... 3.) Corsair HYDRO H110 Extreme performance water/liquid CPU cooler.Fans are absolute Junk... This thing does not cool better than my old Corsair hydro 80.  The fans make horrible grinding noises which will need to be replaced.  I will not PURCHASE fans to fix this problem I WILL EXPECT corsair to send me new fans.  I did not replace this item, but I can tell you the quality does not impress me on this either.  The heatsink portion of this cooler is not flush flat, it actually has a concave bow to it.  Very disappointing.  I will most likely continue to keep an eye on my temp's until I can afford to replace it with another brand.4.) Corsiar Dominator Platinum 8GB (2x4GB) x 2.  So far so good... I will not hold my breathe at this point.  If they go bad I will make sure that Corsair at least lives up to their warranty and get them replaced if I have any issues.", This has been a fair unbiased review.  I have been an A+ certified technician since 2000.  I have been building gaming systems for years.  Never have I ever had an issue like this where I have had so many bad parts from one vendor in my history of building computers.  The MASSIVE inconvenience cost me more money than I wanted to spend because all of these parts have a limited return policy.  So I had to out of pocket a lot of money to get this system up and running to make sure all my components were good to stay within my return policy so that if any other parts were bad i could exchange them.  Corsair... get your act together.  DO NOT be like all these companies who build a name and them try and go cheap based on GREED... we the customers will NOT tolerate this.  I will NOT purchase anymore Corsair branded products for years to come.  When you failed other brands saved the Day Such as EVGA & Cooler Master.  This has been one of the worst building experiences I've yet had.POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS...My view of Corsair as of now is BUYER BEWARE... If any of you have also had the same issues please post them to help other customers avoid the nightmare I went through and tell Corsair we will NOT tolerate poor quailty!!!...,4,13

To the point where it is very distracting. They sound like loud crickets.Also the instructions could have included more details on the back plate. On some configurations the back plate will appear to be very unsymmetrical once installed. A quick search online will let you know that this is fine but it would have been good to have a picture or diagram in the instructions so you wouldn't be surprised or concerned., I put in a support ticket about the noisy fans 4 days ago and haven't heard anything back from them.

When I run my 9370 at 100% it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and the mobo shuts the system down at 70C.-The motors in the fans make an awful grinding vibrating noise when they run at 100% (1500 rpm).This might just be unique to my system. The noise might be attributed to reaching my system's natural frequency causing vibration. I would say this is most likely not  what is happening and that the fan motors are just loud when running at 100%, but I don't have another cooler to compare with to definitively say what is causing the noise.-Installing the radiator and fans with the eight long screws is challenging. It would be much easier if there was some sort of clip just to hold the fans in place while the screws are put in. However, it is not impossible."," **Under normal circumstances it works perfectly fine.** While playing some of the most demanding games and CPU intensive programs the CPU wont break 53C. However, the fans will be running at full blast. I'm replacing the stock fans with BitFenix 122 CFM fans. I hope that will cool the CPU more efficiently.I was expecting to be blown away with the cooling capabilities of this 280 mm radiator. My opinion of this radiator is that it is just alright. It works and keeps the fx-9370 cool enough under NORMAL APPLICATIONS ONLY. If I had a 125 watt CPU I bet this cooler would be phenomenal, but I can not push the fx-9370 CPU to its limit with this cooler and that is why the Corsair H110 Extreme gets 4 eggs.",1,3

I've done numerous builds all with corsair water cooling and have seen only one radiator near perfect condition, CQ needs to figure something out.- Fan mounting screws only allows for a pull setup, I suppose you can say it allows for a push setup, but who pushes hot air into the case? PROPER push or push-pull will require additional screws which IMHO, Corsair, being the enthusiast parts supplier should be providing this."," The fans are silent like stated in the description, however, they are REALLY silent, so much so you wouldn't believe the rated CFM.

Under normal loads, higher temps will never happen."," It's honestly overkill and I should have saved a few bucks with a smaller cooler. Even overclocked to the point where it needs 1.3v, temps hit mid 80s Celsius in heavy stress tests. I backed it down to 1.25v for longevity reasons and temps barely hit 70. This is using blended P95 for hours and maximum Intel Burn tests. Under normal gaming loads, temps are more like 40 - 50 degrees with that 1.25v overclock.",0,1

9SIA6ZP3K32295,35-181-035,5/5/2014 11:11:01 PM,Roman K.,Almost Silent! Simply Amazing!,5, Very simple design without any extra software or flashing LEDs.Silent! I have two Noctua AF-140 PWM fans on the rad. The only noise I hear comes from the pump., No cons at all!Mounting mechanism is great.Fit my 750D spot on.," Get this, both of my Noctua fans are spinning at about 346 RPM!! That is right, a three digit number, 346 RPM. My CPU temperature is about 32 degress C with a simple load. That is insane, I absolutely love this cooler. I am not a gamer. Rather I am more a creative arts producer involved in engineering applications, photography, and video editing. I care about noise; silence is an absolute must for me! I do not care so much how cool the processor is as long as the solution is silent.Just to put that into perspective, my previous H80i with a Noctua AF-120 PWM fan was spinning at about 2,300 RPM to keep my CPU at the same temperature. Even though Noctua fans are praised for their silence, at 2,300 RPM, the fan noise was extremely distracting to me. I forgot to mention, my CPU is an 8 core Intel Xeon E5-2670 - Sandy Bridge EP. In conclusion, if noise matters to you, choose this cooler. I am an Electrical Engineer by profession, but you do not need an engineering degree to know that 140mm fans can spin slower while producing the same amount of air flow. Couple that with a 280mm rad and you have a winner. If you want the software control and LED lights, get the H100i, but know that your fans will for sure be spinning faster than 700 RPM. Basically, any water cooler unit will be able to get your processor to the temperature you want, the question is at what cost? The price you pay is noise tolerance. If noise matters to you, it is simple physics; get the biggest radiator with the biggest fans.",8,8

I bought this from a B&M store and thankfully I had purchased the insurance plan on it, because I messed up during installation (I put a thing onto another thing backwards. Once on, it was impossible to remove and correct my mistake.) I would actually pay for better instructions and/or a pre-assembled AMD or Intel loop (the thing that the water-block attaches to).- Actually screwing the water-block onto the motherboard was very difficult. I had to screw one of the four points on first, angling it in so that the other points were up in the air, nowhere near their screw-in points. Surprisingly, after some panic, and much work, I was able to attach it, and was a good, tight fit on the CPU.- Doesn't come with fan-splitters"," I removed the pre-applied thermal compound on the water-block, and applied Arctic Silver 5.On the first day using this product, I was eager to do some overclocking. My dream was to overclock my AMD Phenom II X4 965 to 4.0 GHz (stock clock is 3.4). With the radiator fans on max speed, and the CPU's stock clock of 3.4 GHz, I got an amazing 39 C under full load; same with 3.5 GHz. With 3.6 GHz, I got 40 C. From 3.7 to 3.9 GHz, I got 41 C. At my target clock-speed of 4.02 GHz, I got 42 C. I changed the fans to PWM because they are loud at full speed, and then got 46 C.Then I started noticing something strange. Playing games that used both a high amount of CPU and GPU power (e.g. Tomb Raider, Crysis 3) would cause the game to crash, and the GPU-accelerated graphics in any program on my computer to be all messed-up. After online research, I realized I had to increase the voltage on my CPU, and thus I did, to 1.424V.I've been using this setup (4.02 GHz @ 1.424V) for over a month now, and it has not caused any problems.With my previous CPU air-cooler, the ZALMAN CNPS9500A-LED, I used to get temperatures of about 70 C on max load. Remember that this chip's max temperature is officially rated at 62 C. The chip would still function at 70 C, but at around maybe 75 C, it would throttle down and cause stuttering in Battlefield 4, a CPU-intensive game.After the Arctic Silver 'burn-in period', temps have dropped 1 degree C (46 C to 45 C), even with the slight increase in voltage.I have not tried going above 4.02 GHz. I will be content at reaching the 4 GHz plateau.",5,5

Ultimately, I settled on buying the h110 for a few reasons:1. My Corsair 540 case can mount large radiators.2. The fans were quieter than the h100i3. The watercooler was independent from corsair link, it uses the traditional 3-4 pin fan power cord. It took sometime to put together all the pieces of the h110, but once that was done it was relatively easy to install. So far the difference is amazing. Not only are my temperatures half of what they were before with the stock cooler, but the h110 is smaller and neater than the traditional air cooler.Another plus is my pc no longer feels like a heater, but it actually feels like a fan that pushes cool air into the room.Overall I recommend the h110 to anyone who can fit it in their case.", None, One fear that I had was that the h110 would leak. But as soon as I powered it on the feeling of uncertainty went away.  The transition from a air cooler to a closed liquid cooler feels like the transition from a hdd to a ssd. It would be hard for me to go back to the traditional cooler.The h110 is definitely worth the money imo.,4,4

Came very well packaged6.  Wide CPU socket compatibility7.  Hoses are nice and flexible, and pivot at the pump head which makes installation easy.Temps are measure in the following conditions:1.  Room temp of 70 Deg F2.  Prime95 Blend test, all workers3.  CoreTemp used to monitor CPU speed/CPU temp4.  My motherboard pushes all cores to 3.8 GHz at 100% load, so it is using a variation of multi-core enhancement.5.

The first one is minor, and has to do with the poor documentation.  The manual should go into more detail with how and where to hook up the heat pump and fan power leads in common various scenarios.  The manual also fails to mention you want the heat pump head to operate at 100% at all times (measured as 1500 RPM in the BIOS or fan monitoring software).2.  The second con is actually what go an Egg removed.  Corsair, for some inexplicable reason, chose to brand this as the Quiet Edition.  Well, that is definitely not the case.  The fan is clearly audible and I am not all that fan noise sensitive to being with....especially audible given that I chose a case top mounting position for this unit.  The fan is NOT PWM, which means that many motherboards are not going to be able to change the fan speed to accommodate different temps.  The fan run will fun at full blast no matter what.

I understand now and then something is not going to work.  However, when something does not work, and it is not user error, I expect some ability to get help quickly.  I was building a computer for a customer, and this computer was specifically designed to work in a high-ambient temperature environment (maybe 95 F).  I specifically used low-heat parts (SSD, i3 35 watt CPU, lots of case fans, and a hydro cooler) to achieve this, and ironically it is reporting higher temps than if I had simply used a stock fan.  I removed the cooling head from the CPU twice, checked the thermal paste (both times there was a square, indicating it was making contact) and cleaned the CPU and cooling head and re-applied Arctic MX 2 thermal compound.  Now, after a user has done the obvious troubleshooting, one should be able to contact the manufacturer and get some sort of resolution quickly.

Why Corsair didn't include a PWM (4-pin) fan is beyond me. Not like these coolers are dirt cheap! C'mon, throw us a bone here! In addition, the included fan is definitely louder than I wanted--it's approaching the volume my stock AMD cooler would operate at. Not cool.

I have two intake fans in the front, and have one exhaust fan attached to the cooling solution in the rear. My case temps do not exceed 33c with an overclocked 760 and 3570k in a Corsair 550D silent case.A million fans do not necessarily cool your case the best, I've been there and done that already. In reality if you live in New York or Florida where it's constantly hot in the summer time normal room temperatures would be hard to achieve, so blowing hot air in and out a million ways is not the most optimal solution. it's all about wire management, proper fan displacement, and the quality of the case.",None,None

N82E16835181029,35-181-029,6/25/2013 5:02:08 PM,Erick C.,excellent,5," Works well, fair price to performance, quite a bit better than stock cooler on a haswell, 4770k. Id buy it again."," The fan is not thermal sensitive, and, to me its very loud. Because of that I ordered a new good 4 pin thermal adjusting one, this one is a 3 pin mb connector, though it certainly works like the dickens. Anyway, that adds about 20 to the price for someone whom cant deal with the noise of this fixed speed fan. Consider that and maybe buy one that has such a thing already included...? Or order the fan alongside? Compared to old school pcs its about average noise, but by modern standards, its a day at the airport."," The performance is excellent and all that I could have expected for the price, and a substantial difference on a haswell over stock cooler, i mean like ~20c all around. Im presently low use, web browser, etc, in the upper 30s, with stock haswell routinely in the 50's. My haswell is presently modestly overclocked at 4.1, inch by inch and step by step, I cant afford another one.I would but this again. I wish the fan was 4 pin thermal, but not all machines can handle that i guess. include an adapter would be easy solution. Anyway, I order a nice light up one, should be here soon enough.I would definitely buy a corsair cooler again. This is my first water cooler, and im sure not my last. Install was moderate, but that cause, well its a bit involved, but I could access my mobo back without taking it out, so that was good, and secondly, I think the instructions could be a tad bit clearer, but I am no pc master.I bought this at a local shop for about the same price, but I buy most everything on newegg so I wanted to put a review here.

I have them running on an AMD Phenom X2, Intel Core i7, and Intel Xeon. It's much quieter than any fans I've used.", Two of H55s I have are a tad noiser than the one other. Maybe there's some air going through the pump -- I'm not sure. It hasn't been such a big deal though and I haven't gone through the trouble of trying to replace it.," I set these up in a push-pull (two fans) to bring air in from the back of the case and reversed the fan in the front of the case to push air out (the front fans usually pull air in).This Corsair line doesn't have much competition, but 1 start off for the slightly louder ones.",None,None

So I decided to give it a try and reach out Corsair, initially I was bit hesitant to reach out support because of two reasons- either manufacture will somehow blame customer on not fixing it properly and second I will have to ship to USA from Canada for half the price of the product will be spending it on shipping, is it really worth it?But I was surprised on how corsair handled my issues and promptly replaced the fan for free of charge and received the fan within a week.

N82E16835181029,35-181-029,4/23/2013 12:39:31 PM,Andrew H.,Great for the price,5," $73 for a closed-loop system (with a copper CPU block) is a great price, and this brought my stock AMD Phenom II 955 temps to 33c idle and 55c load. Nothing shameful about that!"," Doesn't perform as well as a H110 but hey, it doesn't cost $129 either. It would be quite foolish of me to expect the moon with a humble H55, wouldn't you say?"," There are a lot of foolish individuals posting reviews on Newegg lately. This is an H55 ""quiet"" series, which means 1) moderate performance compared to other, larger coolers, and 2) an underwhelming fan (it's QUIET, which usually means ""not high-performance"").So, listen up: If  you're expecting $100 performance, you should be buying $100 water coolers, which this thing is not.Also, it is IMPOSSIBLE to cool anything below room temperature (since the room's air is ultimately what cools your system). And, even if you live inside a refrigerator, the device that is generating heat will ALWAYS be above room temperature, even if just a little bit. The CPU's that are at or under room temperature are the same CPU's that are under tubes of liquid nitrogen.Lastly, if you think the fan is too loud or too slow, NEWS FLASH: replace the fan. Duh.Don't label yourself ""Tech knowledge: 5 - high"" if you don't understand the basics of how computer cooling works. If you can't plug the cooling fan into the right header (which should be obvious to anyone who's even pretended to install computer parts), you shouldn't be buying these things yourself.",17,19

Not the best but gets the job done well., Wish the instructions would tell you that you have to install the pump to the CPU plugs on the mobo and the fan to an aux plug.  Hooked it up wrong and CPU went up to 100C...  Re-did the plugs and temps are back down to 30C where they should be.Doesn't do that much better than my old Xigmatek Gaia.  About 3C better but that's nothing.  Didn't knock an egg off because of this because I wasn't expecting much.," Bought this mainly wanting to get rid of my Gaia cooler with the 120mm that came with it that's just loud.  This was on sale at a local store and picked it up.  Now, everything's more quiet and working as it should.  Please keep in mind that this doesn't do as well as a lot of high end heatsink coolers in the market.  But it most certainly get's the job done.  If you find one for sale, grab it.  It's a great cooler.Knocked an Egg off because the instructions should state which plugs you should plug the 3-pin connectors to.  Otherwise, the pump won't turn on at all and all that heat will be in one place, not transferring heat to the radiator.",0,1

FX-6100 @ 4.2 ghz and my idle temp is 23C. Full load and the processor can get past 60C. I had to dump this one for a better performing cooler.," This is a great cooler if you are doing minor overclocking say just 200mhz or so. Or great for stock settings. At stock, it knocked my idle temps down to as low as 5C and maxed out at 28C. But once I put it to the test and did some serious overclocking, this cooler started to perform very poorly.The fan to me is also not that great, loud and not efficient.
