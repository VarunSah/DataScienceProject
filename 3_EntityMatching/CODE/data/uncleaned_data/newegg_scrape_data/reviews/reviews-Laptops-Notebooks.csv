Fast enough with an SSD upgrade"," Granted this is an older model and it was a refurb, so no huge expectations. But in a year of VERY little use, various keys are failing. A big aftermarket for replacement keyboards (a real chore to get too) suggests that my problem is common. I suspect that it has a lot to do with the vulnerability of the keys when underneath in tablet mode, despite being careful what I rest them on. The case is a bit flimsy and warped - mine never really sat on all four rubber pads - perhaps a factor in the keyboard failure."," You can do better. I wouldn't buy another flip 2 in 1, rather I'd just go for a detachable keyboard tablet to keep those keys from hazardsI see they are still selling refurbs here, so I'll add a note that mine did arrive with scratches on lid and bottom - these are not next day store returns - they've definitely been used.",1,1

It has a metallic finish unlike lower end inspiron models .To normal eyes, this is something definitely better than XPS carbon fiber. I received a lot of complements from people around.Screen resolution is not the best, but it is sharp and has very good viewing angles. Also it is very light weight compared to my previous Inspiron Duo model. Dell associate added a leather sleeve free of cost for my purchase, when I did directly through them. I own this laptop for 4 months now, and this is my all day laptop. So far no issues. Unlike other comments, I never had either battery issue or screen problem.

Bios is a little bit of a pain to deal with until you figure it out," It does not have an ethernet port, but this is not a laptop.  It's lightweight and functions well as a tablet and an ultraportable.  I would assume if ethernet is an odd must have for you - then a $5 usb--> ethernet cable would do the trick.  Bios notes - it's fairly locked down out of the box.  To boot to a USB stick it's easy once you get the trick.  You just need to turn the secure boot off, and enable the legacy boot devices.  I don't often tweak the bios, but I found this easy for someone even at my level.SSD notes - please search around a bit before doing the upgrade - at least I recommend you do.  I had a crucial M500 sitting around which worked fine in another pc.  But I could not get the bios to see it at all.  Regardless of anything we tried from cloning the original drive to a fresh format and trying to install windows (at times bios would see it, but windows was a no go)Internet posts led me to get a samsung EVO which installed in a snap and was easy to configure and go.  I do believe this is only SATA 2, so I don't get lightning speed, but for the $75 to pop an SSD in it was amazing.I'm not saying Crucial / others won't work in here, just sharing my frustrations which if you google around- you will see people sharing their thoughts on what drives worked for them and what drives they had trouble with.

I then went to the Dell website to get the manual for this laptop in English but that manual made no reference to this port. I then called Dell and got transferred five times during the call all around India only to get someone who had no clue what he was doing. He finally said the laptop does not support an Eithernet connection just a wireless connection, which I do not believe. It now looks like I will have to find and buy an adapter myself.

The backlight is awesome, this is my first keyboard with it and I wont go back.  The backlight brightness is also configurable via fn + f3/f4. There is a LED in the power button to indicate power.  The caps lock button has a LED inside the button to indicate status.Case:  The description says that this laptop is brown.  I thought this was a mistake, because it certainly looks silver.  However, it definitely has a pinkish/champagnish/brownish/purplish tint.  It is not very noticeable, but enough to make it stand out, I like it. 3 USB ports is nice.  SD card reader is nice.  There is a LED for battery charging status on the right side, next to the headphone jack.   There is a LED for disk activity on the top side in the upper right.  Overall the case is nice and feels very well made / sturdy.WiFi: Stable and AC is fast.  I just ran a speed test and got 3 ms ping, 260 up and 386 down.  For reference, at the same time and in the same place I got 3-238-240 on my phone. (Google Fiber)Performance:  Boots extremely quickly.  Resumes from sleep nearly instantly.  I can easily stream Star Wars Battlefront from my Xbox One on the highest settings, very playable."," Screen: 13"" screen is great overall size, but at the highest resolution, it definitely feels small.  In very bright rooms, the screen can feel not quite bright enough.  Not sure why, but when the screen is white, I can barely make out a diamond pattern.  It really doesn't bother me much but it is noticeable in certain conditions.  The pattern is always there and does not change with screen settings like resolution.Touchpad: The buttons are part of the touch sensitive area, which can be annoying.  I just checked and it doesn't seem that I can configure the area. It just doesn't feel as accurate as my previous laptop, can't exactly put my finger on it (see what I did there?)Keyboard: No real cons on the keyboard but see other thoughts.Case: Front edge (where your palms/wrists might rest) is actually relatively sharp (compared to my last laptop anyway).  It can definitely leave marks in your skin and it is not very comfortable. WiFi: No issues herePerformance: I get decent frame rates in Minecraft, but it is basically unplayable due to severe graphics artifacts, not sure what is the cause yet.  I've tried different Intel drivers and changing settings and resolutions, but it is always the same outcome.  I nearly docked an egg for this."," Keyboard does not have the numpad keys, obviously due to the size of the laptop and I understand that, but coming from a laptop that had it, I now realize how often I used it.  I can supplement with a USB add-on, if I decide I need to, no big deal.Case does not have an ethernet port, but that is understandable due to size constraints.  Again, I could always use a USB adapter for that.The unit I received is like new - no dents/dings/scratches.  The battery appears to be holding a charge well. As I write this, Windows 10 is saying that I have 78% with 4 hr 55 mins left on the battery.This laptop comes with Windows 8.1.  I promptly did the free Windows 10 upgrade.  When the Win10 download had 57% remaining, I hit 100% battery charge and unplugged it (the time was 5:05).  At 5:50, I had installed and logged into Win10 and it reported that the battery was at 84%, pretty good if you ask me.The wireless chipset is an Intel AC 7265.The RAM is reporting 2/2 slots used.The SSD is a SanDisk SD7SB3Q256G1002.I have not tried Bluetooth yet.Power brick: The cable is relatively short and the brick is pretty big.  Normally this wouldn't be a big deal to me but the prongs that you plug into the wall just stick out of the side of the power brick, so it needs a decent amount of space around the outlet it plugs into.  You could definitely just supplement with an exension cable and problems solved.Overall this is a fantastic laptop for the money.

I called Newegg support when I realized that it was not correct, but they said the only things I could do were send everything back and get a replacement laptop + charger or talk to Asus. Unfortunately, by the time I noticed that it was the wrong charger I had already put in a good amount of time setting everything up (about 4 hours) so I didn't really want to send it back and lose everything. So I decided to call Asus. Like most customer support I gave them the information about the situation about the laptop. After we talked for 20 minutes the solution I was given from the representative was that I would need to buy the correct charger from Asus. Even though they sent me the incorrect charger when they were packaging up my laptop, they wanted me to pay full price to get the correct charger. It seems outrageous to me that you can send me the incorrect item and then say you have to pay extra now to get the correct one.As a side note, the customer support representative could not get my name correct the entire time we were on the phone.  My name is very simple (I asked him to call me Jake), but that didn't seem to stop him from calling me ""De Yong"", ""Yang"", and ""Wilson"".

Within 30 seconds of booting to desktop, the fan began blowing extremely hot air really loudly, and I checked the ugly Lenovo power management tools taking up half the taskbar and it reported 35-40 W (!!!!!) draw on battery while doing absolutely nothing. I checked Task Manager and nothing was using considerable amounts of CPU or RAM. Fully charged battery had a little over an hour of estimated life at that power consumption.Panicking, thinking I'd got a lemon refurb with some sort of catastrophic hardware failure, I booted into a live PuppyLinux USB to see if I noticed a difference.

9SIA43F2116195,34-200-846,8/27/2014 12:26:35 AM,Stephen .,One of many Fail Dell Laptops',5, Oh it is great if you want your mouse to move all over the screen then bang and throw it all over the place that is what is good about it.  I have dropped this laptop so many times and I still can't manage to break it!, None it is not broken yet., Make a better Misses Gosh from Las Altos Laptop!,0,2
9SIA43F2116195,34-200-846,7/7/2014 6:17:24 PM,Clinton R.,Great laptop with legacy PC card (PCMCIA) slot,5," -PC Card/PCMCIA slot: I was in dire need of a modern-ish laptop that still had a PC Card/PCMCIA slot on it.  In my research, this is the best spec'd laptop I could find.  Everything (including some options of this very laptop) has moved toward ExpressCard slots over PC Card slots.-YMMV on this one, but this laptop shipped with 4 GB of RAM and ~250GB hard drive.  I think the specs for the RAM, Processor, and Hard drive that are listed are a minimum since these are refurbished items, probably from a lease.  You can expect at a minimum what is listed, but might end up with better specs like I did (double memory and a larger hard drive).-Battery tested fine, but I've only been using it for one day.-The power supply is the 90 watt Dell OEM (slim).  Works fine.-Looks practically brand new.  I bought a e6400 a couple weeks ago, and it was a little worse for wear.  But it looks like this machine has all new rubber feet, new keyboard, possibly new bezels."," Couple minor things, easily fixed...1. System bios was A03, which was like 13 versions ago.  The latest version is A16, which installing it was a little tricky.  You actually need to install A09 first before it will allow going to A16.  Head over to dell and do this, it will solve any instabilities you might have, and probably increase system performance.-Couple of drivers out of date, but that's standard for any new laptop that's been sitting on a shelf.  Head over to Intel's website and install ""Intel Driver Update Utility"".  You'll probably find that there is a newer driver for the graphics and RAID software. -Windows 7 Home Premium.  I was hoping I would end up with Pro but I did not.  It's not a huge issue, but you can not host remote desktop.  What did bother me is the original COA was Windows 7 Pro.  I guess there is something if the refurbishers don't have the original install media, they have to install their Windows 7 refurbisher's license.  You could probably use the original COA license with the Upgrade Anytime Feature to get to Pro... but you would probably have to call in to activate it... and I'm sure there are some legalities associated with it.-Came with ITunes (outdated) installed.  This is going in a business environment, so I uninstalled, and the 4 or 5 other Apple applications that installed with it (Bonjour, Update service, etc).  It also came with an older version of Adobe Reader.  Uninstall that and install the latest version."," -32 Bit Windows 7: the PC card device I need to work with the laptop only has 32 bit drivers.  A 64 bit Windows 7 needs 64 bit drivers.  So this is a plus for me.  However, 32  bit Windows can only use ~3.5 GB of Ram natively.  Along with some other 64 bit instructions, this might be a drawback to someone else.",1,1

Appeared to be completely unused - very clean, bright screen with no defects, and no sticker residue or scuff marks. - Got 4GB of RAM instead of 2GB, and a 230GB drive instead of 160GB. Score!", - Smelled like somebody hosed down the laptop and shipping box with cologne or bodyspray. It's stunk up my house and it gave me a headache. - Despite being a 64-bit processor it shipped with Windows 7 32-bit. Not happy about that at all.," Good deal, even with the Win7 32-bit surprise.

There are plenty of other reviews of this unit elsewhere, but this refurbished unit from Newegg is in excellent condition and works like new!  I paid for overnight shipping on Monday afternoon, received it Wednesday afternoon,and  as always, Newegg, you rock!"," The battery needs to be replaced out of the box.  This is very common with refurbished laptops, Newegg sells both 9 cell and 6 cell batteries, I recommend buying one when you order this unit.  Internet Explorer did not work and I found an add on installed that prevented IE 10 from working.  If you find this is the case, do the following: go to the START menu and clicking RUN.  Type “iexplore -extoff” and then click OK.  From there, disable the add ons that came with the laptop, and you are good to go."," The description of the computer on the webpage is a little light as these laptops can come configured in many different options.  This is perhaps intentional as a refurbished unit, they may have listed the least common denominator amongst the series and you may get something configured slightly different than what I received.  This is definitely a case of YMMV, but at least you know what one person received and I am very happy with the purchase!",3,3

The screen is fine, no dead pixels, looks fine.  It's not a 1080p screen, but I don't really mind that.  There are stickers all along the laptop itself to hide possible blemishes from previous users, but the only one I can see is the one I have on the back of the laptop.  The stickers are kinda grainy finished, which I kind of like, except for the one on the touch pad.  I believe it makes the touch pad a little dull.  I use the pointing stick thing anyways, so it's not a problem for me.  Overall, the stickers actually are kinda hard to distinguish and unless someone is looking for it, nobody will notice.  Also seems like you should be able to take that off, so there's that.  I would get this only if you are also considering upgrading the RAM and/or the Hard Drive.  Otherwise, 4GB ram now is pretty cruddy for a laptop unless you're running linux.The only reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is because of the battery.  The battery itself seems to be an old one.  It runs out after three or four hours, I believe with wifi on and browsing reddit or something like that.  However, I figured that the battery would be bad, so I didn't mind too much.",None,None

A 0-100% charge took approximately 2 hours while constantly being tasked with installations and uninstallations.* Display looks good.  Doesn't get super bright, but bright enough to work in an office setting.  Doesn't get as bright as my ancient HP Pavilion dv7 screen that I'm currently staring at while typing this review, but still is pretty good!* SILENT.  So very, very silent. No heat on my lap while running at a full load for three hours in a 85 degree room.* Device appears to be brand new... don't see any signs of refurbishing on either unit that I ordered.* Matte finish is very fingerprint-resistant - sweet!* Netflix streaming seems to work just fine, leading me to believe that video streaming from other internet or intranet sources would work fine.  The display seemed a bit dark though while streaming."," * Device was bloated with Acer software and preloaded garbage.  System would freeze when uninstalling.  Took me four hours to uninstall all of that garbage before I could even install a few items of software.* Mousepad takes a bit to get used to; keyboard has a lot of empty space between keys, which threw me off a little."," * Change the ""appearance"" option to performance-based - a lot of the slick effects will stop, but this thing will run three times more efficiently.* Processor speed is painstakingly visible when installing files or when running a full anti-virus scan.  * Very little hard drive space left after system files (11GB) and programs/apps (7GB). * Display almost appears matte-y... Not a flaw or concern, just interesting.  The whole gray laptop has a matte finish.* I'm not sure if this type of SSD registers as an SSD... it acts like it (quite, seems fast in terms of read-write speed) but the disk defragmenter I use (Auslogics) doesn't register it as an SSD and defragged it like an HDD.* Overall, a good bargain piece, but I wish Acer shipped it just with Windows and drivers to connect to the internet.  Would have made the experience much better.  Internal camera shows as 640x360p/30fps according to the Camera app by Microsoft.* I added a MicroSDXC card as a semi-permanent add-on via the embedded sd-card slot for additional memory without taking apart the casing to swap the SDD.* The settings state that the device is two-point touch capable... I can't see where, when or how (even in tablet mode, the screen doesn't respond to touch) so maybe that's a mistake, or there's an error somewhere in my claim.This thing makes you want to scream for the first five hours of ownership.

It's extreme durable with the metal case and super easy to upgrade and maintenance because the entire bottom comes off giving you total access to a well laid out components.I purchased 16 gigs of ram for mine and a 120 gigbytes Solid State Drive. I also purchased a CD/DVD Hard Drive Caddy so I can remove the CD/DVD and replace it with another 2.5"" Hard Drive or SSD. I also purchased a refurbed DVD RW.

There was no way to make Windows install disks (for use if Windows has to be reinstalled). However, I bought an inexpensive external USB DVD writer, and I created a system image as a set of DVDs. This is not quite the same thing as install disks, but I suspect they will work if I need to use them.

I would never buy this but it you're looking to buy this for someone starting with computers it's not a terrible choice.," Sadly, there are far more cons than pros. It's cheap so most of these are to be expected. It really does feel like it's made from really cheap lightweight plastic. I'm pretty sure it will break if i drop it.

I'm use to high end mechanical keyboards so it's safe to say im exaggerating but regardless even compared to my own personal laptops keyboard this thing is junk.

Just think of how annoying that could be on someone trying to type out a long e-mail or even writing an essay. It comes with Windows 8 which i could not hate more. Seriously Microsoft i really hate you right now. But again, that's more of a personal choice and has nothing to do with the laptop. The touchpaid failed me already.

I was transferred, disconnected, and generally given the run around.  Even when speaking with a 'supervisor' who asked for my number in case we got disconnected, I received no return call.  There is an open case with HP now, but despite mentioning the case number to each of the staff to whom I spoke, they started me from the beginning, running through the motions of the initial ""device manager"" checks.  Again, never felt so snubbed by a support service.  This will absolutely be last time I purchase anything from HP.  I will update accordingly if anything is to change, but until then, buyer absolutely beware - HP is not willing to employ a support staff who provides any kind of support whatsoever.  Extremely disappointed.  (Newegg still coming through strong, and delivering everything as expected - as usual.  HP could learn a thing or two.)"," See Cons.

Chassis is mostly plastic with some aluminum trim. It flexes a little but feels reasonably solid and doesn't creak at all. Sound output is decent even though the speakers are on the bottom of the unit.," The keyboard is very stiff and unforgiving. If you press a key close to its edge, sometimes you can trigger the tactile feedback of a key press without actually having a keystroke register. Frustrating cause of many typos until you get used to it.There are no maintenance ports on the bottom of the unit. If you are looking to upgrade the storage, the top cover (keyboard and trackpad one piece unit) must be removed. If you are looking to upgrade the memory, the whole lower unit must be stripped down to the chassis, as the RAM slots are on the back side of the motherboard.", The track pad is average.

9SIA0AJ3297013,34-314-534,8/10/2014 8:04:43 AM,GERALD R.,A great mid-range gaming laptop,4," The full HD display is wonderful.  The keyboard is also a very nice chicklet style.  The battery life is good but suffers a bit if you're gaming as you would expect.  The NVIDIA GEforce 840M handles gaming quite well.  I'm currently running Skyrim on the High preset at 1366x768 resolution.  This leaves me with a comfortable framerate, but you could probably push the graphics a bit higher if you're willing to live with some choppiness outdoors.  All in all you get what you pay for as far as gaming capabilities go, but this laptop actually performs a little better than I expected.  If you're looking to play some great games from the last 5 years on high graphics settings you're good to go with this machine, but don't expect to be running most new games on high settings.  You should still be able to play most new games; however, most likely on medium or low settings.I'd also like to point out that the speakers on this laptop far exceed my expectations, and are of a higher quality than any laptop speakers I've ever heard.  They are loud, crisp, and capable of immersing you in the sound of your game while you sit on your couch with your laptop.  If you like listening to music, you will also find yourself pleasantly surprised with the speakers.  This is also my first windows 8 machine, and I have had complaints with it at all.  Don't listen to the negative hype.  Once you learn about a few of its features, like the robust search function, you will find that you can easily locate any program very quickly.  I would recommend this laptop to a friend, and I would buy it again myself if I had to."," The touch pad isn't the best quality.  I find that it is sometimes a tad unresponsive for a split second.  It hasn't caused me much grief, because I typically use a mouse for gaming, and when I have used the touchpad I've had overall positive experience with only a few mishaps.  It wouldn't keep me from buying the laptop."," I would also like to make a shoutout to Newegg for their speedy and quality delivery.  This was my first purchase from Newegg, and I opted to pay for the fast processing time on delivery.  I had my new laptop in 3 days.  If this is your first purchase from Newegg, do not worry about dings or scratches or anything like that.  They ship laptops in a box with plenty of padding.",5,5

The build quality is very good and comes with Windows 10 Home preinstalled.The laptop is a little slow considering only4GB memory but I upgraded the memory to 12GB by purchasing a Crucial 8GB card which boosted the performance considerably. I am yet to upgrade the hard disk to a 250 GB Samsung Evo which will definitely make this laptop fabulous. Bought this for generic computer application, not for gaming or design or graphics intensive work. Although I think it will work fine for graphics related tasks once I upgrade the hard disk.The build is sort of plastic with a glossy finish outside and matte finish around keyboard. The mouse pad takes a little getting used to but I didn't find it to be annoying. Works fine!The screen responds to touch pretty well and is vibrant enough for day to day use.

9SIACGB5460137,34-298-346,11/6/2015 11:19:46 AM,Anonymous,Nice computer for schoolwork,4," Lightweight computer with a impressively response processor, decent stock system memory, respectable hard drive, built-in DVD R/W drive, and comfortable keyboard/track pad.I really can't stress enough how nice it is to have a laptop with a keyboard that actually registers when I press the keys again. For the past 2 years I've used an Asus laptop with a similar 'chiclet' keyboard that you had to hammer on to get anything to register, so it's a huge relief for me. While I still use my Pok3r mechanical keyboard for most of my typing at home, it's nice to know that I can count on the laptop's built in keyboard and trackpad on the road.The PC is also pretty responsive when opening and running various programs, even on the stock 4GB of memory. Granted, this sits at what I would consider to be the higher end of the ""budget"" category, but it's roughly $130 cheaper than the similar i7/6GB RAM model I tried in the store and it feels every bit as fast in every day actions.The front facing speakers are also quite loud and sound very nice. Although I really only use them to listen to music in the home office, on many laptops I've found that unless you get a high end model the sound isn't very good. So it's sort of surprising to get some decent ones in this price range. Sure, bass isn't amazing, but everything else is crystal clear and easy to hear even at 50% volume or less."," Color accuracy and viewing angle of screen could be better, it would be nice to have a glass plate covering screen, no drive activity indicator, power supply feels dated and cheap.My only real complaint about this laptop is that the viewing angle and color accuracy of the screen could be better for the price. I realize that a lot of other laptops in this price range don't have the most amazing screens either, and given that I'm mostly using this for school/office work it won't affect me too much, but keep this in mind if you plan on using this to watch movies on the go or do some light (and I mean light, it's only an i3 after all) gaming on it. As for my other complaints, I would have preferred that the touch screen use a glass plate like other touch laptops simply because it's easier to clean and less likely to scratch. I don't use touchscreens much myself, but when everyone else in my house can't seem to resist the urge to touch LCD screens, it's nice to have that protective layer.The activity indicator and power supply are both minor complaints as well. I do miss the right angle style of jack my old Asus supply had, along with the way it kept the power ""brick"" at the plug itself and not in the middle, under my feet, like the Dell charger. I also miss not being able to tell if the computer is just hanging because it's waiting on the drive or if it's actually frozen, which I used to use my activity LED to gauge, but that's gone now."," Overall this is a really nice laptop to consider if you're doing school/office work a lot and need something light and portable. It lacks the aluminum accents of similar Asus models, but I strongly feel that despite the casing being all plastic the overall build quality is superior. Now, one last thing, as far as the RAM issue mentioned in a couple of the other reviews, this laptop uses one 4GB stick of SK hynix DDR3 SODIMM PC3L-12800S-11-13-B4 memory, with room for one more RAM stick on the board. So if you're looking to double your RAM, hypothetically any other 4GB stick that runs at the same speed and 1.3v as this one should be compatible, but you can always order an exact twin of the current ram from a *ahem* different online retailer for around $20.I only mention this because I've had compatibility issues with other laptops and ""high performance"" RAM from companies like Corsair, and I have yet to see the RAM timings posted anywhere else online.",None,None

Sofware installs slow and this laptop generally just feels very sluggish.  Yes it WORKS, but the speed is mind numbing.

9SIA4P03N89655,34-298-727,6/18/2016 1:24:04 PM,CHRISTOPHER M.,It's a Great Machine,5," The exact model I bought was the 17"", 1080p, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD model.  This model comes with the i7-6700HQ CPU and GTX 970M GPU.Price - I feel this model is a great value versus similarly priced machines from Gigabyte, MSI, or ASUS.Game Performance - I have tried out a few games such as Mechwarrior Online, Diablo 3, CS:GO, Grim Dawn, Dark Souls, and Stellaris.  All have performed very well with smooth framerates and higher detail levels enabled than possible on my Geforce 650 Ti Boost desktop card.Chassis - A combination of metal and plastic surfaces which all have a nice tactile feel to them.  It's not especially rugged, but doesn't feel flimsy either.  The hand rest area is plastic, slightly rubbery, and is very comfortable.  Lighting effects are configurable and add some style without making the machine look like a toy.Cooling - During gaming it will get warm and the fans will spin up.  The fan noise can be noticed but is not loud or annoying.  I have been using it without a cooling pad and it seems not to need one.Keyboard - Very pleasant feel overall, full size keys, slighty mushy feel versus Cherry or other high quality switches but good versus other laptop keyboards.Trackpad - Works well and can be disabled with a function key on the keyboard.  I use a mouse most of the time so the latter is a great feature for me.  Backlight is unique and cool.Sound - On my Bose IE2 earbuds, music sounds fuller on this laptop versus my custom desktop with Gigabyte motherboard and integrated Realtek audio.  I don't know if the SoundBlaster audio chip is behind it or what.  I feel the low frequency response is better and the amplifier is definitely more powerful.  The SoundBlaster control panel software is nice and easy to understand.  I haven't tried the built-in speakers much but they seem OK so far.Internals - From the bottom panel you can easily access the battery disconnect, wifi card, 1x SATA connector/2.5"" bay, 2x SODIMM slots, and 2x NGFF/M.2 slots.  The first thing I did was pop the HDD out to get a copy of the factory image, and transfer some Steam backups to it.  Then I cloned the HDD to a M.2 SATA SSD and removed the HDD. These processes were pretty painless so I am happy about that.  Note that I did not test an M.2 NVMe drive."," The biggest performance factor on this machine is the lack of an included SSD.  This can be fixed easily by buying one separately.  The cost of buying a higher model of this laptop is too high in my opinion, just to get the included, small, NVMe SSD.  The HDD impacts performance as far as loading times go, and you will notice some stuttering in most games especially during the first few minutes of gameplay as all the assets get loaded from disk.  Once everything gets cached to memory the effects are much less.  Installing an upgrade SSD alleviates this issue completely.Keyboard - The extra function keys so far are throwing off my reaching for the Esc key, and the editing keys are squeezed into non-standard locations in favor of a standard numpad layout.  There are no media playback keys for controling music apps, and the volume controls require pressing the ""Fn"" button.  HDMI Output - The built-in HDMI-out port works OK but there is a noticeable color washout when displayed on any monitor.  I have done some comparison testing and it's definitely a problem with the HDMI out and not the monitor or cable.  I plan on contacting support about this once I get a chance.  The issue does not affect the builtin display which is beautiful.  You can get around this color washout by purchasing a USB-C to HDMI adapter which runs DisplayPort over USB-C to an HDMI connector.  I did this and it works fine.Size/Weight - For the performance level this laptop is compact, but it is by no means a small machine.  I had a hard time finding a laptop bag from a 3rd party (don't like the Dell bags) that was large enough for it.  I ended up getting a large size Timbuk2 laptop messenger bag, and that is barely big enough.The battery is sealed inside the laptop.  At least it can be disconnected easily."," This computer comes off as very refined right out of the box and I am very happy about my purchase.  Performance is just great, and with an added SSD it is essentially flawless.  Based on my first few months with it I would recommend this machine 100%.",1,2

So far I've only played HotS on full settings, and had zero performance issues. Design and customizable lighting earn it high marks for style. Nine macro keys for whatever you might need. Runs nice and quiet. Also a great productivity machine. I do plan to double the RAM in the near future, as I will use this machine for work as well as play, but it tackles conservatively configured VMs simultaneously with concurrent tasks on the host with no issues. The backlit trackpad it pretty awesome - it's responsive and looks great. The hand rest area is large enough that you shouldn't ever bump the trackpad if you're typing."," Windows 10 issues with wireless cards gave me fits the first few hours... I did have to go to Killer Networking's site to obtain the latest drivers which seem to have cleared up the issues. They had a more current version than Dell did. Very slow to boot up and wake up from sleep without an SSD, but the price to include one in the higher end models is pretty significant. Consider purchasing an SSD on your own and installing it yourself.It runs hot. Very hot. You'll feel the keys get warm.The woofer underneath the machine isn't great. In fact, it's pretty mediocre. Gaming sound effects are good, but if you're listening to music it's probably better to use external speakers. Lots of real estate in the hand rest area, but the material on the surface will suck up any little bit of oil on your hands and the laptop will immediately get all fingerprinted up. Not a huge deal if you don't mind it looking smudged up, but it gets on my nerves. Same with the keyboard.An external SATA port would be nice."," I bought the base model because budget, but I do plan to buy a SSD to use as a system drive, and additional RAM. That should speed up the VERY slow boot time and increase performance for multitasking. If you can afford to buy the models that include them, awesome, I'd recommend it, but those are easy enough DIY upgrades that you can realize some savings doing it on your own. Also, it's heavy. Not really a con, you're buying a desktop replacement so you're probably aware going in it's not going to be as light as a Surface Pro or MacBook. Overall, I'm happy with the product. It does what I need it to - after tracking down a fix for the WiFi card, of course - and it performs very well at a reasonable price.

I looked at dozens of laptops with the GTX 960 and a 17"" screen, but none came close to the price. I do a lot of work with Lumion and a booming video card with 4 GB of RAM is what I needed. I also was looking for one of the newer Intel processors for energy consumption, and it had to be an i7 for rendering purposes. An i5 would not do because I actually utilize the quad core (8 thread) processor. Lastly, I wanted a hard drive that had enough storage, but was a lot faster than the stock 5400RPM hard drive. The optional 256GB SSD was essential for doing what I do. The outcome:Unpackaging the laptop, I was like a kid at Christmas. Everything in the box was well designed and seemed to utilize every square inch. The entire laptop case is a rubberized black plastic. I can only equate it to the inside of an Audi. Clean design, perfect feel, and all the right touches such as the red backlit keyboard and the large clickable trackpad. The bevels of the case and screen are minimal and are reminiscent of the surface tab or the iphone 4, 5, and 6. The performance was as expected given the hardware. The system (after initial boot and configuration) boots in about 15 seconds from off and about 5 seconds when in standby. The bloatware was minimal, but I still spent about 30 minute removing non-essential software. Acer did provide a few nice touches where they have consolidated some of the automated system settings into one easy-to-use interface. Some of the settings in the Acer Care Center include general system settings, recovery management, tuneup, updates, support, and even a startup optimizer that helps control what software starts when your system starts. My advise to everyone would be to make sure you do a system back up right away and then install the service packs for windows and then do another system backup. Lasting impressions:I would highly recommend this machine to anyone that does more than word processing or internet browsing. This machine would be wasted in you hands. Instead, if you are a gamer, this machine is for you. If you are a 3D artist, this machine is for you. If you use design software for architecture or engineering, this machine is for you.", None.,,1,1

Be warned!",5, Read on, Read on," First of all, the reason I got this machine was because I was tired of moving my stuff from old laptop to the new every 2 years during nearly mandatory upgrades now days, learning new OS and figuring out how to run old programs and games (Brood War still the greatest RTS ever made) without being cut off from new stuff (CCP, when will I finally be able to hit the casino in Jita).  So I thought ""Hey, I should get the latest and greatest Gaming Rig. That should last me a few more years.""  And, BOY, WAS I WRONG!  No, Asus delivered on it's promise and made a stunning piece of tech. But the devil is in details and here they are:1) I have trouble lifting it! It would be great to drop it on zombies during Apocalypse or make running with it in your backpack an Olympic event or cruel and unusual torture, but ""mobile"" and ""laptop"" Predator-15 is not.2) Backpack - It Doesn't Fit!!! This 15.6 inch machine doesn't fit in backpack's laptop compartment designed for (get this) 17 inch. Too thick. Even the main compartment has to be forcefully zipped.3) Power Adapter - weighs more than my MacBook Air.Yet the cables feel too thin and flimsy, like they will bendbreak in a month.4) OS - never did I want to learn Linux more, than after trying Windows 10. Less prying and more open architecture, Microsoft. Why Linux? Because no other Windows OS will install natively on internal SSD without modifying ISO. Forcing me to use DoNotSpy10 and a like so early in the game just in bad taste on Asus's part.5) NVidia bundle - what a scam! One pathetic non-returnable download for $70? Really, Newegg??? Look at the bill and weep.Pros:1) Overall Predator-15 is a sophisticated air cooling system with a computer parts attached to it. It's fun to show up at a local coffee shop, overcrowded with pretentious... sorry, creative types with MacBooks and tablets, dump this monster on the table, turn it on and watch the airflow rearrange the furniture. Extra cooler in place of Blu-ray is also nice touch.2) Battery - One full length full screen 1080p movie would pretty much discharge the battery. 20 minutes run through Shadow of Mordor all out settings took it down 40%. Just sitting there looking pretty would last you about 3 hours.3) Screen - Great, just great. It's non reflective and colors, contrast and latency - all top notch. It just looks a little lost on that huge front panel.4) Keyboard/touchpad - sinking keys and buttons, color coding and proper (not inverted to ""Fn"" as on so many new laptops) F1-F12 range. Touchpad does get smudged easily.5) Sound - Good build in speakers! It even has a subwoofer. And with Bose headphones - YAKES! Something breathing down your neck is hair-raising.6) Video - it's Nvidia 980m with 4 GB dedicated. Need I say more. Everything I've thrown at it, from GTA V to Elite, hadn't troubled it. Yes, it gets warm and noisy, but that what the extra cooler is for, use it. Haven't tried it on my LG 4k TV yet due to cable issue.7) Structure - hell yeah!!! Very little play, not as solid as Macs. For the weight and size could've been better, but hey. Plastic all around, but what a nice fuzzy feel it has, like it's gonna purr when you touch it.Overall:Very specific machine for very specific user. It's NOT something you throw into your backpack and take with you on everyday bases. And on those rear occasions when bunch of get together for a lan party I'd rather bring a desktop rig.So who is it for. It's someone who wants a topnotch gaming rig and not only doesn't want to build it herself, but also wants to have an excuse not to trouble themselves with upgrading it later.",9,12

Games like Overwatch, Smite, American Truck Simulator, GTA IV, Company of Heroes, and other non-high end games out there.-Kaby Lake Processor: Wow, what can I say. In my desktop computer I have an i7-860 Lynnfield. Unfortunately that old processor cannot completely use our gigabit internet here at home (only 910 down/640 up) but this new Kaby Lake processor EASILY handles it pushing 988 down and 879 up. Specifications here on Newegg are wrong, it's stock clock is 2.9GHz, and it boosts to 3.5GHz. It's an extremely nice processor, I would recommend only buying the labtop offering this processor. -256GB SSD: Not knowing the brand of the SSD, I cannot commend it properly. However, it is very quick, if not as quick as the Samsung 850 EVO 500GB in my desktop."," -The Screen: I'm not going to hate on how the screen looks, it's absolutely beautiful. However, what I will hate on are the viewing angles more notably up and down. So if I'm playing with it on a table, and I lean back from a sitting up position, I will have to move the screen down, else it will be very dark. Side to side is of normal for what you get in this price point.-Keyboard: I really wish the keyboard was made a bit larger and more spread out, specifically the F# keys. However, no issues with the feel and feedback from it. Also, include a backlight, lord, all computer now-a-days should have them!-Bloatware: It comes with a ton of bloatware: McAfee, Dashline, Acer Portal, different game programs. I just deleted ALL of it and the computer runs much more smoother."," All-in-all, this is a PERFECT labtop if you're looking for a light-gaming rig to hold you down while you're away from home. Do take in mind that the battery will only last about an hour if you're playing more intensive games. Also has Bluetooth support so you can hook up a XBOX One controller for simulator games or whatever else out there. *Sadly, I had to return the first labtop I was sent, it had four dead pixels on the screen a long with a loose part inside the chassis that would make a loud metallic sound whenever typing or tapping anywhere on the labtop. Fortunately, the old one was shipped back fast, and a new one was delivered and it is in perfect condition. I really cannot be thankful enough for Newegg being such a great company to buy from.

Sound is decent (nothing special, but also nothing bad).The dedicated graphics card and 8GB of RAM makes some more recent, but good games load lightning fast. For instance, I've owned Borderlands 2 for quite some time now and can finally enjoy it at high settings. Don't expect to play Fallout 4 on maximum, however."," The screen is odd, as other reviewers have pointed out. It's not that bright, but increasing the brightness makes everything appear all washed out. You need to view the screen almost dead on or else it dims or the contrast gets kind of wonky. What's more is that some programs behave oddly. What do I mean by that? Well, Google Chrome on this machine does this sort of hop whenever you hover your mouse cursor over any and all links. The entire browser window sort of shifts up and down slightly. It's very hard to describe, but trust me that it quickly messes with your eyes. For that reason I now use Microsoft Edge, because it's designed for Windows 10 it seems to avoid this issue."," I would still recommend this machine for people looking for a great, entry level laptop. It's exactly what I wanted. I didn't want junk, but I didn't have $2,000 for a Mac. If functional and affordable are what you're looking for, then this is a great buy.Some reviews sound like you can upgrade this laptop with an SSD. My machine came with one.

N82E16834232776,34-232-776,2/15/2016 8:49:39 AM,Guillermo R.,Pretty good ultrabook,4, -  Pretty light.-  Looks great.-  Graphics are great (although not top of the line).-  Touchscreen.-  Fast and powerful enough for serious data crunching., -  Only one: very limited upgradeability. This is the reason I give it only 4 golden eggs.," I bought a slightly different version with Win8.1 Pro installed because I wanted the upgrade to Win10 Pro; of course, upgrade went without a glitch. People compare this to a Macbook. IMHO the Zenbook comes up way ahead. The new Macbook is a closed box w/ a single Thunderbolt port and no upgradeability options whatsoever. Furthermore, it comes with an Intel M processor which is great for internet browsing but way underpowered to do serious number crunching or gaming or any sort. The Macbook graphics are better, but that is where the advantages of the Macbook stop. Plus the Macbook will cost you an additional $500. So rather than ""feeling like a cheap Macbook"", this baby feels like a Macbook SHOULD feel.I bought my daughter one of the new Macbooks for school and I have played with both computers. There is no difference in terms of the keyboard ""feel"". For internet browsing, or watching movies there is very little difference (slightly better image quality for the Mac, better sound for the Zen). For crunching data (Matlab or Java matrix operations), huge advantage to the Zen. For transferring your files from one machine to another, advantage to the Zen because of the built-in USB3 ports. For presentations, the Zen has a built-in HDMI, and most projectors have HDMI input; the Mac needs an Thunderbolt-HDMI adaptor which is rather uncommon (never forget yours at home!).",8,8

N82E16834232776,34-232-776,1/22/2016 12:01:50 AM,Anonymous,"Functional computer, but cheap quality",2," The internal hardware is fairly good for a notebook of this size and price. Most other 13 inchers in this price range have compromises, such a weaker processor, less ram, 768p screen, or hard drive.No problems with heat or fan noise. There is a vent right under the screen hinge, which is a fairly creative design, although I don’t know if that comes at a compromise to the hinge strength.","  The quality feels like a cheap imitation/knockoff of the Macbook Pro, rather than a premium product.The SSD I received was a no-name brand ""SK Hynix"" with model number “HFS256G32MND-2200A”. Transfer speeds are about 420/320 MB/s sequential and 13/50MB/s random. Acceptable but not outstanding. The SSD makes an audible electrical noise when in use, a phenomenon that I have never experienced before – every SSD I’ve used in the past has been completely silent. Aside from being annoying, this leads me to worry about whether the SSD is being damaged and whether it might fail on me in the future.The keyboard is not outstanding. The key travel is better than some other ultrabooks I’ve tried, but something about it feels uncomfortable, although I can’t quite figure out what it is. The backlight quality is absolutely terrible. On my model, I get severe backlight bleed under the 7,y,u,l,`,f1, and delete keys, and some minor backlight bleed on a few other keys, making for an overall uneven brightness across the keyboard. Some examples: ( i.imgur.com/RQMtSgM.jpg i.imgur.com/PqKd07R.jpg ) It’s not a dealbreaker by any means, but it does detract from the experience, again making it feel cheap and low quality.The screen is decent as far as I can tell. It is a glossy touchscreen, which is not really my preference but I don’t mind too much. The touch functionality itself is mediocre at best – it definitely isn’t for artists. Speaking of which, the screen barely bends past 90 degrees at all. I don’t have anything to precisely measure the angle, but I’d estimate a maximum of 120 degrees. Okay for use on a desk, but for an ultraportable, especially one with a touchscreen, you would want better flexibility. When closed, I think there is some undesirable contact with the sharp bottom edge of the keyboard indent with the glass screen, which may scratch a line over time.I had a problem with the display drivers, where the display drivers would just crash, resulting in a black screen. (example: i.imgur.com/NMqMDIL.png ) It happens about once per day in my experience. Usually the system will automatically recover, and minimizing all windows and reloading them will restore everything. Rarely (only happened once so far), I need to do a reboot to fix. Still, this problem becomes a death sentence if you plan to do any serious gaming on it.The trackpad is one of the worst I have ever used. Physically, it has more friction than any of the other 3 laptops I’ve used. There are no discrete buttons, and clicking the bottom of the trackpad sometimes results in undesirable sliding of the cursor. Multi taps are not particularly good, and Asus’s “Smart Gesture” software for the trackpad is anything but smart. Two finger gestures are pretty bad and I had to disable pinch zoom and and rotate. Two finger taps are sometimes registered as 1 finger clicks, and two finger swipes are sometimes misread as three finger swipes, which is infuriating since you CANNOT disable three finger swipe to minimize all windows or switch windows, which I would much rather do with Win-D and Alt-Tab respectively. The battery lasts for 5-6 hours of use, which is barely enough for a full day of college for me. The AC adapter that I received makes an unsettling rattling sound inside, and has a stupid, bulky shape that covers two outlets at once.The machine is somewhat upgradeable, but not particularly future-proof. I haven't opened it up myself, so this information is mostly from google: The primary SSD is 2.5inch SATA. There is an extra mSATA slot. RAM is partially upgradeable to a max of 12GB. There is no support for M.2/PCIe SSDs. There is no USB 3.1 type C / Thunderbolt port."," Overall, it's not a bad computer, but a lot of minor annoyances really pile up.If you just want a (relatively) cheap computer with decent hardware, the zenbook is not a bad choice.However, if quality matters to you, know that this is definitely no Macbook.",5,17

I purchased the laptop for internet / email / light word processing and this computer was way too weak to handle that.  According to the specs, it should have been more than adequate.  Something was wrong from the start.  A few weeks into using it the mouse stopped working and after running some diagnostic tests I found out that the hard drive was bad.  I tried to contact Newegg by email but they never responded.  If you call or try to use their online messaging tools, the wait time is always several hours.  I contacted the seller and received a quick reply, but they insinuated that I broke the product so they would send me a new hard drive to install myself or I could pay for shipping both ways and they would replace it.  Since I can't wait a week or two to get my computer working again, I just purchased a laptop at a local store for a couple hundred bucks more and it works a million times better.  I highly recommend staying away from off lease / used computers and just buy new.  Newegg won't let you post names of their competitors in reviews, but go to the online store that is named after a river, which has superior products for not much more and their return policy is amazing.  I'm sure this seller is great as long as there are no problems, but if your computer doesn't work you are out of luck.

My unit had something that looked like silicone sealant on the back of it (not sure why it was there), as well as a very noticeable wear point on the display glass right in the middle. I tried to do an exchange, but it would have been over a week to get a replacement, with no guarantees that the replacement would have been any better.

Especially bad is the space bar, which also must be struck very near the middle, and misses even hard keypresses near the left side. Keyboard is usable overall (no key fails completely), but is notably unpleasant to use because of these issues.The battery that came with this laptop did not work. It was at 0% charge, and would not charge.Windows indicated either ""0%. Charging."" or ""0%. Not charging."" depending on which of other online tricks regarding 'recalibrating' the battery I did, such as repeatedly removing and reinstalling battery drivers. BIOS upgrade could not be done since it requires a charged battery.I did all kinds of net searches and experimentation to try ever desperate trick to get this battery to charge. It would not. The battery was bad, and simply could not be charged.After debating whether to waste time with the vendor trying to deal with this, vs risking throwing good money after bad, I finally decided for the latter. I bought a new battery online, about $50. Opening the laptop and swapping the battery was a pain. But the replacement worked. New battery worked and charged great, with reasonably life.

It is very light and sleek, runs very quiet and cool, and there is plenty of RAM and space to run Photoshop CS6 and handle various image editing jobs. Though there is a limited angle of view for the screen, it is very clear and bright and there is no color cast. The audio is surprisingly good for laptop speakers. I also like that it came with 3 USB ports plus an SD card slot."," No installation disks were provided, which I hear is pretty typical these days. So one of the first things you'll want to do is to use the installed Asus Backtracker program to make a bootable recovery image on a flash drive or flash card. You'll need at least a 16gb size, and you can't use part of a large external hard drive as existing data will be overwritten and boot files are written in the process. Once you've made a bootable recovery drive, you can delete the 20gb recovery partition that comes on the hard drive. But if you don't need the extra storage space, I suggest you leave it there.The buttons on the trackpad are loud and the buttons are unusually configured which makes it a little hard to use. But I've had this same issue with almost all new laptops I've purchased so I think it's something that needs to get used to. There is also no bluetooth, but if I really need it, I can add it with a relatively inexpensive BT dongle."," While this was a refurbished unit, it came looking brand new. There were no scratches and the screen was perfect. Everything seems to be working as it should. I bought this from Newegg off the auction site where they also sell a lot. It was purchased on a Monday and it came on Wednesday, so it was typically good and dependable Newegg service. All in all I'm very pleased with this notebook and think it's an excellent value.

Good for basic desktop use, web browsing, email, even a lightweight development system. For anything that needs more oomph, I can use it as an X terminal to my more capable but rather less portable desktop system. Performance-wise, I expect it could serve me pretty well for a good decade or so.Good battery life under a light workload. Fairly light weight, at least for the performance and price.It's got a few other nice things that I haven't seen on many other laptop models. There's a joystick for a mouse as well as a touchpad, which is often useful. The keyboard light at the top of the screen is nice, although I probably would never have noticed it if someone else hadn't pointed it out."," First, the big one. About six months in, the hard drive started getting unrecoverable read errors.This leads to the next major gotcha: The hard drive is a 1.8"" form factor instead of the 2.5"" that you find in basically every other laptop in existence. 1.8"" drives are hard to find, and they're really expensive -- replacing the drive would cost more than half what I paid for the whole laptop. Ultimately I just got a slim USB drive to use instead of the internal hard drive. Linux is nice that way, but I don't know if WIndows would let you do that.While it's pretty good for a Linux machine, the hardware is a little short for running Windows. 4GB is kinda tight to run Win7 in my experience. Depends on your workload, of course.Under a heavy load -- long compiling jobs, video decoding, probably most games if you could get them to run -- the battery life drops like a brick. I can usually get 3-4 hours of text editing, but video playback will kill the battery in less than an hour. And along with that, under heavy load the thing runs really hot.The GPU performance is bad, even by Intel standards. My 10+ year old netbook which can barely run a web browser anymore can run Steam's streaming client at twice the framerate, 10 times better video quality, a fraction the latency, and with two or three times longer battery life.It's got a DisplayPort connector for an external display instead of the HDMI port you'd find on most laptops. The rest of the hardware isn't really up to the task of doing any of the cool things that DisplayPort can do, so all that means is that you'll need an adapter to drive a TV or an external display."," Since I can run the OS and everything else off a thumbdrive, a bad hard drive is more of an annoyance for me, but I expect it would be an unacceptable failure for most people.Upgrading the memory after the fact is possible and it isn't very expensive -- the computer accepts up to 8GB, and you can get a pair of 4GB SO-DIMM's for about $30. Replacing the primary SO-DIMM, however, involves disassembling most of the case and pulling off the keyboard. Still, at least it's not soldered on.",None,None

9SIA0AJ2X81423,34-317-600,10/4/2015 2:43:05 PM,John B.,Two for Two,4," - I've purchased two of these at different times for clients. The second time I purchased it for a client was based on my good experience with the first time. My first client has nothing but good to say about the PC and I spent enough time with both to give my own opinion as well.- The G50-70's aesthetics are really sleek. It has a beaded top panel and a brushed-aluminum look on the inside. It's relatively light, and rather thin--if not comparing to Ultrabooks. Overall, it's a really nice looking laptop.- The keyboard feel and layout is preferable. The only part of the keyboard that I dislike is the enter key; otherwise, Lenovo doesn't commit any cardinal sins some manufacturers do with keyboard layout. The keys are also responsive, smooth, and have a slight curve to the bottom, which at first I didn't like and thought strange, but you get used to them quickly and in the end are not a con but a pro. The touchpad is also nice, smooth and has two dedicated, thin left and right click buttons, which I prefer.- I immediately upgraded this Lenovo to Windows 10 and, in both instances, it upgraded without a hitch. The touchpad was unaffected by driver issues, and Lenovo has relatively all proper Windows 10 drivers available for download off their website. All the drivers and integrated hardware worked without a hitch."," - The screen bezel is a little thicker than it should be. Nowadays bezels are shrinking more and more, mostly on IPS panels which this is obviously not, but the G50's aesthetics are slightly hurt by the thick bezels. Speaking of the screen; though not terrible, it's viewing angles suffer from quick color drain and fade. Again, though, on a budget PC like this, expecting an IPS or great screen is reasonableness. - Lenovo includes some Bloatware, like all manufacturers, so if you'd like you can uninstall them. However, the Bloatware isn't nearly as bad as some other manufacturers with their third-party apps.- There are some PCs in the same price range that have slightly better specs like an i5 or higher storage space or even 8GB RAM.", - In conclusion: The Lenovo G50-70 is a respectable bang-for-the-buck PC; good for college or school students or home users that don't want to spend too much but want a PC with enough chops to do most any basic/mediate tasks-except for gaming or workstation apps.,1,1

With new HDD and RAM this machine screams, more on this later. Very good screen for a laptop, good contrast and low glare even from weird angles, which is where most laptops don't compare. Stays pretty cool even when playing games for hours."," All the left side ports (USB 3.0, USB 2.0, HDMI, Ethernet, VGA ports are pretty crammed together, making it hard to occupy many ports simultaneously, especially the 2 USB ports, luckily there is a third USB 2.0 on the right side.Battery life is nothing to brag about, but it's only 4 cell so  kinda knew that going in."," I bought the barebones version of this in hopes to upgrade the HDD, the RAM, and the processor with laptop parts I was able to get my hands on. The HDD and RAM were a breeze, I bought an WD BLACK2 Dual Drive (which I highly highly recommend) and upgraded it to 8GB of RAM as well as a clean installation of windows 8.1 to make this thing screaming fast, the only problem was the processor, after opening the laptop and voiding the warranty, I found the proc to be built into the motherboard and NOT up-gradable at all. this was odd to me, as all my other laptops had removable processors. just an FYI if you are thinking of upgrading. But i got over this, and am sticking with the i3, the other upgrades make this thing still so fast. I love this little machine now.The last thing is the keyboard may be something to get used to. I bought this for my girlfriend who is used to Acer laptops and it took her a few days or more to get used to the layout of the keyboard.

It has everything you could need for most computer work. I had it all configured and running exactly how I wanted with all updates installed within a couple hours.

The big screen is great for that, and performance-wise there are no issues, even when working on 3D games.- Wifi card seems fine"," - The keyboard can be annoying. Some commonly used keys are weirdly small, the whole thing feels a bit cramped, and when typing fast the keyboard sometimes can't keep up. Once you get used to it it is OK, but not ideal.- The USB ports sometimes take a while to recognize new devices. I think this is an issue with the physical ports themselves as they feel a little loose. Not sure if this is true for all of these laptops or if I get a faulty one. The USB ports do generally still work but sometimes it takes some fiddling.- The f*&king ethernet port! This thing drives me crazy. It latches onto ethernet cables with a vice grip and I feel like I'm about to tear the laptop in half every time I take out an ethernet cable. If you are frequently inserting and removing ethernet cables this will drive you insane."," Despite the flaws I do really like the laptop. I'm not sure if I would universally recommend purchasing it over other options, as there are lots of good laptops out there without the flaws, however if the price is right then this laptop will do the trick.

Don't.  The numbers pad feels small and awkward.  The whole keyboard does, actually, but the rest you can get used to.  The biggest problem with the numbers pad is its odd ""0"" key configuration - one key wide under the 2.  The right arrow is placed where the other half of the zero key usually goes and that center placement is surprisingly difficult to reach with accuracy.  I fear that this keyboard configuration is going to lead to errors - and for those of us who work with numbers, that's a whole lot worse than a simple ""typo."""," This is one of the few notebooks available with the non-glare screen and a numbers pad - but if you need a numbers pad, this is not a good solution.

Very quiet, even when the fan throttles up, you can barely hear it. I've tested it with a few higher end games and it handled them quit well. As long as your not an extreme gamer, this laptop is more then adequate. I researched laptops for almost a month before finally choosing this model.

Also the sound from the JBL speakers is very impressive. I was concerned about Windows 8.1 that it comes with, but once you get familiar with it, it's not bad at all. In fact when using it in desktop mode, it's almost identical to Windows 7."," The only cons I can think of is it would have been nice if the battery lasted a little longer.

9SIA0AJ2AH2517,34-314-103,12/22/2013 12:49:15 PM,Sean K.,Being stolen from,1, nothing," I bought this thing about two months ago. It died two weeks after I rushed it to my home. The first two days it was already freezing with regularity. After that it just crashed completely. When I tried to get into contact with newegg they were kind enough to set up an RMA, which I should've really seen the hammer dropping from that point. When I sent it back I wasn't aware that you needed to include everything, even things they didn't include. Repeatedly I was asked to return the retail box if I wanted my refund. But it came in a non-descript cardboard box. I kept telling them that. After spending a few hours looking for a customer service number that didn't actually work, getting stonewalled by the chat service, and having the email service repeat the same thing which I repeated told them:I don't have a retail box, you jerks. Which would have at least been okay, but they never sent the actual physical broken computer back either. So now I'm 400$ out of pocket with literally nothing to show for it except for an extreme amount of frustration and the feeling that I was stolen from. Do not buy this computer, there is no way to replace it.",,None,None

9SIA0AJ2AH2517,34-314-103,11/7/2013 5:54:09 PM,John D.,Superb!,5," I ordered on Tuesday and received it on Thursday.  Packaging was nice and the actual laptop box was sealed (never opened).  After opening the box the laptop was packaged securely and everything Newegg stated was included.  I immediately opened the hard drive and memory panel on the bottom and added an additional 4 gig stick to take the unit to 8 gigs.  The first boot up was flawless.  Configuration was smooth and connecting to the home network and home-group was easy.  After getting to the desktop I immediately removed McAfee and replaced it with a better antivirus program.  Windows update discovered close to 200 updates and installation was simple.  After all updates were installed everyone installed without a single failure.  30 minutes of bloatware removal revealed 407 gigs free out of 447 gigs.  At this point I began to put it thru its paces.  Streaming movies from the home network was fast and smooth.  I use the VLC media player and my movies are in several different formats.  All files played fine (mp4, divx, mjpeg, even a few qpeg's).  I tested the web cam, worked fine.  The DVD multi-drive worked fine although a little slow and a little loud.  I burned a DVD and a music CD.  The card reader functioned properly reading a SD card and a microSD card.  The wireless card worked as expected transferring files fast and efficient with no network drops or disconnections.  The 15.6"" widescreen has a wonderful look to it.  It looses its luster as you angle your view from side to side but looking at it straight on is stunning for a sub $400 dollar unit.  The other reviews concerning the feel and functionality of the keyboard are true.  The keyboard definitely feels cheap and the keys don't have that snap to them to let you know you've pushed them.  If this was your only PC and you needed to do a lot of data entry I would consider a USB keyboard.  The hard drive is a 5400 rpm model and performs as expected.  Not fast but not slow either.  After extended use the drive does get hot.  After researching this, the drive temps are normal and to be expected.  The power block is nice and small and doesn't seem to get too warm.  I do not like where it plugs into the unit nor do I like it being a 45 degree plug.  But it does plug in snugly and stays secure.", N/A," For a sub $400 dollar machine there are no complaints.  I shopped around for several days and I kept coming back to this unit.  This is a Christmas gift for my teenage step daughter and it will be able to do everything she wants to do (web browsing, word processing, light gaming, burning movies and music CD's).  I plan on buying another one after the new year if this model is still available.  I would definitely recommend this unit to all my friends and family.Windows Experience Index: 4.6 PCMark 7 score: 1620 (v1.0.4)",1,1

I bought this on sale for 500, which is a good price relative to what they were asking (800)"," The laptop is poorly made with serious design flaws. First is the mouse. Its right over the battery which causes it to move all over the place, this is a known problem among users but Lenovo doesn't recognize it as a problem so no free fix. Its not worth buying and having to take apart and fix (I did what the other review said and followed youtube). Lenovo doesn't help and they act like you are wasting their time when you call. Also, the keyboard keeps popping up, its a cheap plastic keyboard that is suppose to snap in but keeps popping out because of poor design. There are also driver problems with the video card, if you don't turn the computer all the way off when you start it back up the screen is either so dark you can't see anything with the lights on or its just a blank screen but you can hear windows sounds when you hit enter etc. Also, when buying this don't think that windows is loaded on the SSD to make it boot faster because its not.

I had the touch pad issues right away after turning the computer on for the first time.  Within an hour after receiving the computer I took it apart and applied the fix.  It has worked great now for 3 weeks.You will need to also adjust the wireless driver settings so that the frequency is automatic rather then set to 20Mhz.

I thought I would work around the touchpad with a USB mouse but it sometime will cause my computer blue screen cause it isn't a certain kind. I have been doing a littlevresearch about this and more and more people are having the exact same problem, and I guess Lenovo is doing anything about it. Other then the touchpad and the usb mouse I'm not having any problems with it yet and I haven't really seen anyone else having any other problem then the touchpad and wireless card.

Great design with backlight keyboard.  Computer is gorgeous!!!," The major flaw is the touchpad.  After a while it goes crazy, clicking by itself moving all around you name it.  AFter a while it gets frustrating.  Checking forums it appears it is a design flaw with the position of the touchpad.  No driver or change in sensitivity will fix the issue you will actually have to send it back to Lenovo so they can fix. Display image is subpar."," The laptop in its essence is very powerful, looks and feels great.  Very responsive and fast.  The only real complaint is the touchpad which becomes annoying after using it for a while.  This issue has been documented since December 2012 and they have yet to address the issue.  That may be the reason this beautyful looking ultrabook with such great specs has a low value.  If you have no issues with playing your luck and buying it go ahead.  If you get the issue you can send it back or fix it with Lenovo.  Lenovo customer service is okay.  I love it and don't want to send it back but I think I will.",1,1

9SIA9B557X4201,34-234-404,1/1/2017 6:34:57 PM,Anonymous,Solid product for the money,4," In the last few years, laptop processors  seem to have reached a limit around 2.5-2.7 GHz, so the 2.5 GHz Core i7 offered in this unit is fairly close to the top of the line. The 1TB HDD offers very reasonable data transfer speed averaging 80Mb/s, which is good for a non-SSD drive. I do not find booting time slow.  The size of the drive is a plus. You can do a lot with 1TB storage space. The full HD screen is excellent. Matte is much better and less eye strain than the shiny displays of few years back. I like the fact that this unit (as most ASUS laptops) has good cooling, which prolongs the life of the electronics. The fan is located at the rear panel, which frees up space for USB port at the sides and cools the processor efficiently. The laptop is quite light for a 15.6"". So far so good."," The weakest point of this model is the Wi-Fi WLAN. The Atheros/Qualicomm chip they have put in this model is advertised as low-energy, which is supposedly good from a radio emissions standpoint, but I find that the connection quality degrades quicker with distance compared to my other wireless devices. At 15 feet distance, I found it hard to download stuff quickly. ASUS customer support got back to me pretty quickly with an updated driver, which seems to be working better.  I haven't used it long enough to give a final verdict.Other cons: The CD tray is made of thin plastic and could break if you're not careful. Not a big issue for me since I don't use CD/DVDs too often. Same critique applies to AC power socket, have to be careful there since plastic quality around it does not inspire much confidence. Overall, I would say the plastic housing more generally appears made of plastic that is a notch less durable than older ASUS models. I suppose that is OK, since they have to cut the quality somewhere in order to give you that price."," As I expected, Windows 10 has many annoying GUI features that I managed to get rid of using some simple software that restores some of the lost Windows 7 look. Can't say too many positive things about Microsoft because I feel that 80% of their time is spent in undoing the positive things they managed to get right in the previous editions of Windows. The tiles in the start menu are just as dysfunctional as the idea that you should have the same OS for both smartphones and desktops. The graphics of some legacy elements inherited from Win 7 (e.g control panel) look  fuzzy and you can tell they are being piped through an application that loses some of the original resolution in them. Providing feedback to these guys is a useless excercise since they never listen, or rather, listen only to those users who tell them what they want to hear. If the next edition of Windows isn't better, perhaps the time will have come to switch to Mac or Linux.",None,None

It's been returned twice, 1st for a bad power adapter, took over a month to replace.  It's been at Asus now for over a month with a bad keyboard.  Have called 10+ times, and every call is the same.  They say they have not received the unit.  I provide a tracking #, then they change their story and say they have received it but don't have status.  They say they have sent a message to the dept. that has received it asking for an update.  Each time I call that's the run down, and it takes about 1 hour for each call.  I ask for a supervisor and get the same story and they ask me to call back tomorrow and they will have an update.  Tomorrow comes and I call back but the story is the same.  I'm convinced they have lost it but no one want to say that yet.  Great hardware is nothing if the company can't process a simple RMA.", I own my own business and provide IT services for 100+ customers and make sure each and everyone knows not to buy Asus based on my experience.,1,2

Let me preface this by saying that I have bought Asus products for years - this was my 3rd laptop from them and I had also bought a motherboard for a desktop from them. I never had any serious issues with those purchase so I decided to stick with them for my latest purchase. As you have probably guessed though, it wasn't long before it started having problems. It stopped charging within a couple of months of buying it. I contacted their customer service people and found that Asus customer service is especially abysmal - emails from these people were in unbelievably broken English and the things they told me were inconsistent from one rep to the next. The only thing that was consistent was that they were all of very little help. Eventually I was told I would just have to buy a new charger from them. That irritated me but I was desperate, so I did it. A few months later, guess what - it wasn't charging again. So I called up the customer service people again and after a lot of back and forth was told to send the computer in. I did this and a few weeks later they sent it back in exactly the same condition, still not working. I called them up again and after some more back and forth was told to send it back in. I did that, and a few weeks later it came back with another new charger and a replaced part. I just got it back and is working for the time being, but I have very little confidence in it and it has been a huge inconvenience. I have owned this computer for less than a year and in that time the computer has literally spent months being of no use to me either because it wouldn't turn on/charge or because it was in transit back and forth and back and forth from Asus.On top of this the firmware they have for the touch pad is really awful, and the fit and finish is not as nice as my friend's Macbook Air. Basically, under close inspection/first hand use, this think is pretty junky compared to the Air as far as I can tell. In addition to my more major hardware problems, I have a couple dead pixels and the ""feet"" on the bottom of the computer aren't perfectly aligned such that when I place it on a flat surface there is a slight wobble that can be felt.This most certainly the last Asus product I will ever buy. My advice for people in my situation in the future would be to go with the Apple not only does it appear to be a better product with better customer support, it's also an American company. Hope you learn from my mistake!", Do youself a favor and do not buy this computer!,None,None

Then I have formatted the hard drive and installed Kubuntu 12.10 Linux. In Kubuntu you can set the mouse gestures and user 3 finger scroll and pinch zoom (go to system settings). The webcam, audio, wifi, blutooth, video hardware acceleration with 3D desktop works and smooth. The battery life in Windows 7 is 5 hours and the battery life in Linux is 8 hours which makes scene since Android os is Linux. The sleep, standby, shutdown, restart all works perfectly. The standby especially works very well I use it ever day, it puts every hardware to sleep and on lid open it turns every thing on in an instant (In Linux)."," Battery does fast in Windows. USB 3.0 hardware for this motherboard is not fully understood by Linux kernel (3.5.0-34-generic and below, don't know about the newest)  which means you can not read from USB 3.0 port when the flash drive is USB 3.0 however you can read and write to flash drive that is USB 2.0 or 1.0 on both USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 ports. Other usb 1.0 and 2.0 devices words perfectly fine. Also if you have an external USB 3.0 HDD enclosure that has a chip controller (which is 90% of external USB 3.0 hard drive enclosures out there) then this laptop's USB 3.0 port will work with the external USB 3.0 HDD enclosure and you will get the full 80MB/s and up speed.Avoid Kubuntu version 13.04 it has problems. 12.10 works perfectly."," Very strong, well built, light, professional looking laptop. Batter life is very impressive on Linux. I fell like I can carry this laptop with me anywhere and do anything because of its lightness, powerful processor and long lasting battery.This ultrabook can take abuse like no other. It runs cool and make no noise. I could not find any replacement for this so far. Every day I go to work I carry this 2 pound laptop and I do not feel it. On the train I use this laptop for an hour then at work for another 2 hours and going home another hour. When I get home I have 4 hours of battery left.

I couldn't believe how well the OS supported its components out of the box. The wiki wasn't kidding. Near everything works including the buttons that control stuff like screen brightness. Wi-Fi N works as well (at true N-speed).

Lots of expandable storage (potentially three M.2 SSD's and one 2.5in drive).Can handle GTA V at mostly maxed out settings, at native resolution - I was really impressed!The included 1TB drive is a 7200RPM HGST (Hitachi) drive - in my experience, Hitachi drives, particularly their Ultrastar enterprise-grade drives (which this is not) are extremely reliable.Screen looks great!  Nice hi-res display, clear, no darker/lighter areas, and great viewing angle.Macro keys are extremely convenient - they can perform sets of keystrokes, open programs, change fan speed, volume, etc.  I decided (for now) to use only one set of Macro's - you can have up to five different sets of macro's.The ""fan speed"" controls also seem to control performance.  ""Eco"" mode causes noticable lag in games, ""Normal"" is decent, and ""Turbo"" makes a lot of heat and noise, but is the best performance.The glossy trackpad shown in the pictures and complained about in reviews on YouTube from about a year or more ago, is GONE!  My unit arrived with a matte finish trackpad - much nicer than the one shown in pictures."," Gigabyte's Aorus software is a bit buggy, occasionally doesn't work right, crashes, and has a lot of engrish - but it works for the most part.Sound quality isn't the greatest even through there are plenty of speakers - on the left/right front grilles, and center-top grille near the power button and screen.  Aorus offered an equalizer in their driver update program, which sounded like it might be cool and help, but it does nothing.  Open the program and it must crash before doing anything at all because it does not show up in Windows processes or even pop up a window.Screen doesn't open that far - angle is a bit too shallow for what I'd like, but it is workable.   For example, if you have your legs propped up on something that's higher than your lap (like sitting in an office chair with feet on desk), the screen is at an uncomfortable angle and doesn't open far enough.  But thanks to the IPS display viewing angle isn't an issue.Also, related to the screen, there is a bit of wobble, even while having this on my lap typing this review.  I'm a bit worried to see if it will get worse over a few years of use.  Going back to the software issues again, Gigabyte / Aorus recommend using their own custom Nvidia drivers - which are SEVERELY outdated.  I haven't tried official Nvidia drivers yet but probably will soon.  I did some research and other people on forums have tried the official Nvidia drivers and had issues.I have had some issues with network connection dropping out while on battery, several times, and about five feet from the router.  I'll see if I continue to have issues."," Things that aren't cons, since they are to be expected:Black finish is a fingerprint magnetBattery life is pretty bad...Loud, loud, loud...  And hot.  But to be expected in a thin machinePlease note that I have only owned this computer for a day.

If you're looking at this laptop as one of your options, I advise you to watch a handful of videos that are in depth and cover basically everything about it. You can compare what you learn about this machine or others that Aorus has built, against other brands and builds and make up your mind from there.

Because the lid was closed and powered itself on, it confused itself and attempted to go into sleep mode at boot, so the laptop would not recover. The only way to recover was to force shutdown, which caused an error at boot. All of the ""wake on LAN"" settings were turned off in BIOS and in the Power Settings of Windows, ""magic packet"" disabled in Device Manager, etc... I know the laptop natively came with Windows 8 and this comes with Windows 7; I don't know if there is a NIC driver that didn't jive with the onboard NIC? Not sure. The other alternative is one of the NIC's could actually have been bad - not sure. Regardless, I had to arrange a return right after buying it, which was a bummer. The NewEgg folks worked with me since there wasn't a replacement in stock. The whole experience was a pain, but to NewEgg's credit, they did work with me.

Went to win10 before cloning drive.  Everything works great although it is a core i3 from 2010 and im typically a desktop user but it does the job it need it to-websurfing-bills-remote connection to work pc.  I bought the dock station separately and now they are including it so for the current price it is a great deal for an older laptop.  if i needed a second one i would buy it right now! but i have no use for it-  the battery life is a little questionable even for the second one.  i'm only getting about an hour but it may be because of the power settings.  The only issue i found in win10 is a power setting when trying to shut down-it will keep rebooting-it just needs to be disabled in power settings and you are good to go(i believe its a quick boot setting?)  Also this will handle at least 6gb of ram and ssd(cloned) win 10 pro.

Bought refurbished before and there were always some issues with condition but not with this seller.  Item looked nearly new and worked well.  Early generation I3 with 2 cores and 4 threads.  Great laptop for the price.  Excellent for everyday use., Not really any cons at this price but touchpad did not work until I updated the driver.  2gb Ram will slow you down.," I had to update the touchpad driver with version 7 -- version 1 was installed and touchpad buttons did not work.  Not a scratch or mark on the laptop - nice.   A lot of HP Enterprise bloatware - not really bloatware but built in security and software management for central management of laptop configuration.  Removed McAfee and the HP business apps that are not needed.  Was still thirsty for RAM and only 110mb of 2gb was available after boot and loading services.  I added 2gb of Elpida DDR3 1333 - same as memory HP uses in these laptops -- and now running 4gb in dual channel mode.  Big improvement in performance.  Be advised, this comes with the original Windows Professional that was installed when new.  It takes a while to get all the updates from Windows update and then you have to install SP1 for Windows 7 Pro.  Took several hours to bring the OS and drivers up to date.",1,1

It came with a fresh install of Windows 7 Pro 64-bit, which I have already upgraded to Windows 10.  The laptop is cosmetically 9/10, with a perfect screen and only a few minor blemishes on the case.  It came with a OEM HP power brick and TWO batteries, one installed in the laptop amd a seperate BRAND NEW battery sealed in an anti-static bag. Ar first I was hesitant because of the lack of a grade in the product description (I have seen ""C"" grades that look like they were pulled out of a fire....) but after reading the positive reviews I gave it a shot. I am definitely not dissapointed.  I purchased this on sale for $109, and even after spending another $20 for an extra memory module  (this laptop only comes with 2GB), I still believe I got a great deal.  For the cost of a new copy of Windows 10, I got an i3 laptop with Windows 10.  I have an extra SSD from my old computer that I will be installing this weekend to really get this thing going.  Awesome seller, and I will definitely look here again when I need another laptop."," The only con with this computer is that Windows 10 does not shutdown properly.

I personally use a powerful gaming tower, but i purchased this for the girlfriend as she likes to game too! +This computer is fast and powerful. The dedicated graphics card allows for great performance, especially in what she plays (smite, minecraft, starwars, life is feudal, couter strike). Plenty or RAM and graphics power for even more modern games.+ I was honestly surprised how large this laptop actually was, I read the specs but still it's huge!+ Great sound design and picture quality, truly is a full 1080p laptop.+WiFi card is strong! Was able to pick k up 3/4 bar connection while being 3 stories away from the standard modem from the cable company. +windows 10 upgrade  was super sweet and simple, wish it was pre-installed though. +ample storage for her needs. +full keyboard+textured track pad. This is a major bonus as I have an issue with track pads, get really speaking thEnglish feeling of them really annoys me but not with this computer. + plenty of USB 3.0 ports allowing for a mouse and headset, with some left over ports. +lite and heft? For its size it's lite (still heavy please not FOR ITS SIZE) but it doesn't feel flimsy. +cooling. As far as laptops go they all run hot. This one is significantly less than those in have encountered. This can run games even on all poorly ventilated surface for hours before I would consider it dangerous. In comparison to my old asus laptop that would litterally leave a burn just after a few matchest of smite it's night and day.+This computer looks nice, it certainly was not cheap and you can tell, quality and visually this computer is top notch. +My favorite feature is the stress free charge port. It doesn't matter which way you try to plug the power brick in, it is a rectangle with nothing easy to break. No light or fiddling needed!+price to performance this computer is a steal. I would even say it rivals the $1200 msi and asus rog gaming laptops for a considerable amount less."," This computer has been extremely pleasing. But does have flaws. -some keys, are well just odd? Size and location some keys are slightly off from a standard keyboard. I may be use to a mechanical keyboard but letters see to be shifted to the right slightly. - F1-12 keys and the FN Media keys are switched from the usual. This may seem like a minor things but is a major issue in some games, namely smite. There is no real fix for this either. So basically you have to hit FN to use the F1-12 keys which is nothe ideal at all as it forces you to lose some conerol while upgrading abilities in smite and a few other games. We rebinded the keys in game, which shouldn't need too happen and after 2 years it was annoying to learn the new binds as the default method was muscle memory at this point. -viewing angles are average-pointless builtin sofware that is tough to remove. -battery time is middle of the road."," All in all this computer met and exceeded my personal expectations. I have high standards for computers and I bought this for her, but with my standards. I have no issue stealing it from here while where away to play my games. If your on the edge with this computer or brand DONT! I am a huge asus fan, they make a pretty and reliable product. This Lenovo scared me as they kind of used to think they where crappy. I'm beyond please as they have truly stepped their game up! I have and will continue to suggest it as they typically run cheaper for the same power as their competitors! This pc will not disapoint.

I called Best Buy to see if they sold this brand and whether or not they could do the repairs for this machine.

Not a huge gamer on the PC but do like to play my occupational few. Has played all I have installed as of now with great framerate. Laptop is fairly thin for a 17+ inch screen. Very clear and no glare, matte finish. With it turned up to it's brightest I guess it could be a bit brighter, but still can see clearly see it even sitting out on my patio.The sound of the JBL speakers is super clear and pretty loud for the size they are. Very little bass but there is zero chatter or distortion when cranked all the way up. Loudest and best sounding speakers I have heard from a laptop as of right now.Construction is great. Nice metal chassis and very tough looking/feeling. Feels very well built and sturdy. No play in the build at all.The keyboard layout is blah and cramped. They have more room on the laptop, they should have made a different keyboard. Wife has a G50-80 and it's the same exact keyboard as a $400 laptop.Metal case being tough, shows finger prints everywhere. Just have to keep it clean. That is more personal preference though.The default UEFI settings are a bit confusing. I understand keeping it locked down and secure, but for about 5-10 minutes was wondering why it would not boot from disc and could only boot to PXE. Two settings I had to change in the UEFI fixed that. Have to turn the laptop on using a small button to get to that screen (size of a reset button on smaller devices. Used paperclip) is a little different. Would have never used it without searching up how to get to the UEFI.I guess for the price you pay you lose something. That is the bottleneck 1TB 5400 RPM HDD. Swapped it out instantly with a ARC 100 OCZ 120 GB SSD. So can't compare...but it's FAST!!!Battery life is average for the size of laptop. Being a 17.3"" screen with ""Energy Star"" settings (not power saver) with screen brightness maxed and music playing at medium level I could surf the internet and move files around for a good 4+ hours. SSD I think makes a huge difference in battery life. I guesstimate I gained an hour on basic usage.Other than that, great laptop. 16GB ram is great, guess I will never have to worry about upgrading that!For $799 I have this laptop with a 120GB SSD. Not bad price at all for everything you get. hope it can last. I look at about 5 year windows with my notebooks. Anything over that is a plus. Last was a NV55C that lasted just over 5 years.

Something I did not imagine I would get in a laptop for under 1200"," - To actually upgrade the laptop, I took an egg off because of the time it took and it looked scary seeing the laptop completely dismantled. Detached screen, detached keyboard, detached mobo, etc.- No dp connection. It has HDMI and the new USB connection but I really would have wanted DP. Its easier to daisy chain external monitors that way. I feel limited to only 1 extra screen for a total of 2 screens. I wanted 3, and without the need of an external adapter."," - Here it goes, out of the box, this laptop is pretty capable. I spent a month and a half using this laptop as it was out of the box. With that, it was a decent laptop. I had to find programs to turn off some motherboard settings because the i7 would not turbo up to its peak speeds (my chip now caps at 3.2GHz and before it would stop at 2.6). While this helped a little bit, the laptop was still not feeling like a thousand dollar laptop.Upgrading this laptop:First of all, there are step by step videos of how to dismantle this laptop by a few different users. Information is not hard to find. Having said that, this is the first time I have ever taken apart a laptop and it was rather fun. The total time for me to take apart the laptop, install new RAM, thermal paste over CPU and GPU, SSD, and M.2 SSD and to put it all back together took 30 minutes. I will admit that the sight of a completely dismantled laptop made me question if it would work once I put it back together but, Im writing the review on this laptop 2 months after upgrades.My upgrades:RAM - hyper x impact 16 gigBoot drive - Samsung M.2 950 pro 256gbMain drive - Samsung 850 evo 256gbI can play GTA V - 1080p - with over 50fpsCounterstrike Source - 1080P - over 100 fpsESO Online - 1080p - steady 100 fpsAverage temperatures are 77-81 celcius WITHOUT a cooling pad.All in all, I say this laptop is a serious workhorse.

You have to disassemble the entire machine to a point where you can remove the motherboard to flip it over to get to the M.2 slot. Your stomach will churn as you trust flimsy plastic to not break while you dismember it without ever even using it just to add a M.2 card. Also the battery is not replaceable, again, in 2016 you make a laptop with this much proprietary junk! They must assume this is disposable.Okay now on to my purchase killer... the ""precision touchpad"". Yes this was pushed on manufacturers by Microsoft, but they could have said no. Stay away from any laptop where the touchpad looks like a single panel, no buttons. These things are terrible, there is lag, there are jumps, the buttons and scolls don't work as expected, there aren't many settings to change because windows controls it, not synaptic's or elan. I have a saved chat with an Acer customer support that ends with them giving me Microsofts 1-800 number, never again Acer, never again. You will notice on high end gaming and business machines they have NOT moved to the ridiculous ""precision touchpad"", there is a reason. Also because of the touchpad it is impossible to run windows 7 without any control over the touchpad, it will load as a basic mouse, but it will jump all over the place and there is no driver you can install to give you more control or functions, you have to disable it every time you want to type.Again, without Windows 7 support you loose 90% or more of the business market, and 60% or more of home users. Maybe windows 10 will  make it, I don't know the future, but it is years away from happening and what I know is that right now in my secure business environment I have to run windows 7 with our proprietary software, so this machine is out of the question with its unofficial windows 7 support and no touchpad support whatsoever in windows 7. you have been warned. again, fantastic specs ruined by Acer disposable engineering and Microsoft precision touchpad",,0,1

Also, I wish it was amber."," So I have the 4th gen I7/860M version of this laptop. BOY WAS I SORE when 960m hit a couple months later, now it's 960m+6th gen i7. Ouch. I digress though. I've owned this laptop for just over 1 year now.I love this laptop. Upon arrival, I immediately gutted it out, popped in a crucial M2 SSD, and some more ram, (VMs for work) and put it back together. This requires, on the 17inch model, that the board come out completely, as it must be flipped over to install SSD or RAM. This may have changed on the 960m board, but FYI, that was my experience.The fans get audible when you're going full bore on a game, but for me, this is on a desk, table, etc. so it has never seemed excessively loud to me, ""normal"" compared to standard fanned laptops. Nowhere near as loud as a ROG can get.The keys are mounted in with small melt-over plastic rivets. Probably 40 or so, it took a while to get apart so I could paint it without ruining the keyboard. Keep in mind though, if you mush a key REALLY hard and pop a rivet, it'll be very difficult to repair without expert hands and a good understanding of plastic adhesives. DONT mash a key. It is strange the keyboard isn't screw mounted anywhere, but at this price, I'm very happy.The whole thing is about an inch thick at the thickest. With the keyboard light turned off, no one would know this was a gaming laptop, which is a boon in business environments when I'm doin' stuff. I do onsite SMB response and IT consulting, so it's nice to ""look"" professional with my most powerful portable.ITS BIG. I recommend you handle a 17 inch laptop prior to purchase. I frequently reach for my  surface pro out of convenience because you cannot safely hold this with one hand and type on it with the other, it's not balanced for it, and it's not effective.The touchpad isn't good. at all. It uses a ""rocker"" switch with a single clicker and a contact on each side - so it's very difficult to right click, and all clicks feel ""spongy."" It's fine for browsing, but for any heavy use, precision, drawing, gaming I bust out a mouse.

9SIA3FA3KF3063,34-315-168,12/21/2015 1:07:35 PM,DANIEL N.,Decent Laptop for the Price,4," Beautiful crisp display, the entire body of this laptop is covered in that soft rubber/silicone that makes it look and feel pretty cool. The downside is that I can foresee this wearing away over time leaving use patterns... or perhaps peeling. I've owned this for about a week now, and done some gaming on it. It does run pretty hot while in game and making full use of the graphics card - on some games in ultra settings with DX11 I have actually seen this slowly drain the battery while it's plugged in. Not a huge concern for me because I mainly play ArcheAge with custom settings in DX9 and it performs extremely well and no issue with the slow battery drain, but if I were a bit more extreme I'd be alarmed. I like the way the keyboard types (I know... just a matter of taste), some nice buttons to kill the keyboard backlight as well as the touchpad. Aside from the sluggishness of the 5400rpm hard drive, this thing is really fast. I plan on upgrading the RAM and adding an SSD later on, which I imagine will make this puppy sing. All the games I play including ArcheAge, Eve Online, SWTOR, The Secret World, Dead Space, Skyrim etc... plays on high or ultra settings with no issues."," The heat when in game worries me. The complaints from other users about how difficult the ram, battery and hard drive are to change worry me.. though haven't looked into those yet. I am an extreme do it yourselfer who has fixed countless laptops and replaced screens etc for all my friends so I don't imagine it's outside my realm of capability but still. The battery drain while in ultra settings in games worries me. Too small of a power supply? I dunno... not a huge deal for me right now, but others might seriously take that into consideration. There's also this annoying audio thing that happens... system sounds... any sounds really that hit a certain frequency causes the chassis to rattle and sounds like a blown speaker. I can put my palm firmly on the surface of the machine and it stops the rattling but... gawlee. Alright, I could nitpick it to death if I wanted...."," All in all it's a good machine that handles my games as I need it to, and doubles as a work computer. With all the negative quirks I mentioned above, I still feel like it was money well spent. I did know getting into this that getting a medium end system was bound to have it's cost to cons ratio. For now, it purrs like a kitten and unless I'm actively looking for things to be wrong with it, I don't even notice any of the downsides.",1,1

Wrong. The process of getting to the RAM module and the M.2 SSD slot is unbelievably over-complicated. There's no reason why Acer couldn't have put a RAM module window on the bottom of the machine (like every laptop manufacturer used to do), but they want you to pay more for the upgraded machine so they make self-upgrades nearly impossible."," I gave this machine 1 egg because the lack of customization makes this an obvious bad deal for budget-conscious enthusiasts.

This laptop is a beast for running VMs, some medium gaming, etc. Backlit keyboard is unintrusive yet effective in low lighting conditions. Battery lasts decently considering what is under the hood."," There are some really annoying hardware quirks/driver issues.#1.  SOUND DRIVER.       I am using windows 10.  This laptop has specific drivers for windows 10 (yay!).  The problem I'm having, is the laptop is overamplifying all audio and limiting it down, resulting in audio that sounds like a pop song.  If there is a moment of inactivity for audio (eg, loading a new youtube video) the limiter is removed and it gets VERY LOUD. According to windows, no software effects are being applied HOWEVER, I have no access to a Realtek control panel to configure the settings properly.       I have spoken to a few different ASUS reps who have replied with ""reinstall this driver:"" and none of their solutions have been of any help to me.       To add insult to injury, if I uninstall the driver and use the generic one windows finds, there is no problem.  However, I need the drivers to make use of some audio programs, so I feel a little helpless there.#2.  DISPLAY PANEL     The panel is a 15.6"" 1920x1080 IPS panel.  It is sometimes a little harsh to look at, but that could be adjusted in color settings.       What I DO have an issue with, is the panel has an ""Auto-brightness"" feature that turns the brightness down when looking at something dark (eg. 75% black pixels) and then CRANKS it back up (slowly) when viewing a webpage (eg 75% white pixels).  I have looked for an option to change to no avail, reinstalled the driver as per the ASUS rep's recommendation to no avail, and am getting rather frustrated with this feature.#3. INTERNAL SPEAKERS     The internal speakers in this laptop are awful.  Maybe it's a result of having a refurbished model, but my speakers at +50% volume start to sound like blown speakers.  They sound unnatural, and what with the broken driver, they sound even worse.  I'd sooner watch a video without headphones on my phone due to the sound quality in these speakers.#4 KEYBOARD LAYOUT     This is a small one, but I didn't notice until I got the laptop that the ""END"" key has actually been replaced by the power button.  Yep.  The power button is actually a keyboard key.  Not a separate switch.  This means the only way to use the ""END"" key is to toggle numlock off and use the number 1 key as end.  That is super annoying to me."," It's a super deal for the price, but I think it's a little too good to be true.  There are too many cons for using windows 10 and that shouldn't be a problem considering your alternative is to use windows 8.1 (yuck).",None,None
N82E16834232361,34-232-361,7/20/2015 11:39:06 AM,Joshua O.,Yet another great machine by Asus,4," So I have only owned this laptop for a little over a month now, but I have to say that I am EXTREMELY satisfied with this purchase. Hardware wise:-it has 16gb of ram. 8 is sufficient for pretty much anything you need to do so 16 is just great.-The NVIDIA GTX 860 is a really good graphics card - I did a ton of research before making this decision (it's also the most widely used in gaming laptops, mainly because it works so well and it is very consistent).-When running with that Intel Turbo technology thing, the CPU runs at 3.5ghz which works amazing for any type of game. This laptop runs every game I've tested on Max settings with no framerate loss.-Maybe this isn't very significant, but the hard drive is much more efficient as well! It spins about 40% faster than most other laptops, which makes it run a little faster in all aspects, not just gaming (loading files, stuff like that)."," There's no SSD, but hey, that jacks up the price by quite a bit. 1TB is plenty if you're like me.When running graphic-intensive games, this laptop will get pretty hot, but only by the fan. It isn't uncomfortable on your hands. I just have a cooling tray so it isn't a big deal. Also, if your room/house is air conditioned, that keeps the laptop significantly cooler as well.""It's a fingerprint magnet"" yeah it's black and fingerprints show up. Just clean it with microfiber or something similar. Not a big deal at all.

CPU is capable of handling anything I throw at it and then some. Was able to run 2 VM's on it with virtualbox and still didn't hiccup. More than enough memory for now. I'm sure in the future I will get more use out of it but for the time being the amount of memory is overkill.,"  Mine came with the BIOS 208 revision. Boot times were terrible because it wouldn't keep the fast boot setting and the boot process seemed jittery. Something VERY wrong with the BIOS firmware!! Also, some settings are unavailable for some reason. Kinda strange. Rolling it back to BIOS 206 revision has it's own set of problems."," I now have the just released BIOS 211 revision and it partly fixed the fast boot problem and also added a setting to allow RAID 0 (you need to read the terrible instructions BEFORE trying to use the RAID 0 setting!!!). Updating the BIOS to 211 is pretty easy. Just use the winflash program that Asus provides. I did not get mine through Newegg. I ended up purchasing through a distributor. Wish I had waited because I could have gotten it for about $100 less through newegg.**** UPDATE***** After threatening to take legal action against Asus to get my money back they sent me a link to a new BIOS that WAS NOT out on their website publically for people to find. It is revision 213 and it finally seems that it has worked out the fast boot issues. However, once again there are settings that are no longer available. I have no need to stripe my drives and tweak settings for gaming. So for me it is a non-issue. However, I am sure others will not be happy about this. It really is a shame that Asus has treated people the way they have on this subject. If you go to their forums or check online people are outraged over this (and very well should be!!). This is supposed to be the absolute top of the line laptop they produce and to go through the kind of issues I have and be treated like a second rate customer is absolutely unacceptable.

Not sure how much you would have to remove to get it out. They clam that it should last later than normal because of how Windows handles the charging. Well I am not sure how that will far. I had a G74SX and had to replace the battery after about 2 years. I think it would be nicer if they had a 512GB PCIe over 2 x 256GB (Note: after some testing you do not want to copy from PCIe to PCIe, it is a bottle neck and is very slow. PCIe to SATA is very fast and you will max out the SATA port.) Knowing this it would be better to have just one PCIe drive until Intel or whoever increases the bus on the PCIe port.Speakers are located behind the screen so depending on the volume of what you are listening to it can be hard to hear. G-force experience software boots very slow about 3 to 5min, you would think it crashed. Fix is to uninstall Asus Game Frist software. X-split software to record is a bit buggy. Have not found a way to config hot key to another application if you want to change it.", Unit looks good and frees good. Good port layout. Glad they have the boot drive as PCIe. The indicator lights could be a little brighter. After you fix the shipping config with BIOS and software it is a great system. Games installed on the PCIe drives will have amazing load times. Windows 10 is a bit to config and learn but not to bad. If you have the money and want a laptop that feels like it will have the power to last for awhile and if the battery is not a failed design it is a good purchase.

The dedicated 940MX also has some kick and is useful when video streaming or playing casual games. Storage-wise, this laptop is lacking but is perfect for me. 256gb of super fast SSD storage is more than enough because I hardly ever use more than 100gb at any given time. The 12gb 2133hz DDR4 memory is also excellent because that means it will last a long time. Most PCs don't even use 8 unless you start doing some heavy video or music editing."," Bloatware: As with any laptop, this comes with several pre-installed programs from Lenovo many of which aren't necessary.Keyboard: I can't tell if it's backlit or not, and that's not good. It claims to be backlit but its pretty dull from what I can see. Also, the arrow keys cut into the right shift key so it looks kind of weird. Not an issue for me though because I don't use right shift at all.Battery: Only lasts a few hours. Again, not a problem for me since I'm not that mobile anyway."," I bought this laptop because I was looking for a crisp display, fast CPU, dedicated graphics, small SSD, high RAM, a sleek design, and a DVD drive. It's absolutely perfect for my purposes but I know some people are more mobile and need more storage, for instance. In that case, you might want to look at another laptop or consider buying an external storage device. The battery life really can't be helped though.Overall I'd recommend it.",1,1

I have to keep mine at 100% max brightness (adaptive brightness is off). Just for perspective, brightness slider at 50% is like other laptops brightness settings at 10%. Like there's no point on this laptop giving you the option of lowering the brightness past 50%, no one would bring it that far down, even in pitch black room. With that said, leaving the brightness setting at 100% is fine for me (and is probably the level of brightness that's ideal to me) but I wish it gave you some wiggle room to increase it even further just in case.-Also, the battery life isn't amazing.

I was going to get (and actually purchased) a refurbished MacBook Pro 2015 with the default specs for CDN $2,300. My gut feeling told me cancel the order. Soon after cancelling my order, I decided to try out Ubuntu on my 2012 laptop (CDN $400), since the main reason I liked the MBP was the Mac OSX. Best decision ever, I felt in love with Linux. I purchased a separate ssd where I installed Ubuntu. I also have an external hard drive of 1TB so the 256GB is only used to download programs.-- Why I didn't get the MacBook Pro --The price. In total I saved CDN $1,300. I plan to use that money to travel when I graduate in 2.5 years. Also this computer is just temporary as I will also buy a power house desktop in 3-4 years. I think that this laptop will be able to handle that amount of time.TLDR: Great laptop, recommend getting an external hard drive and an additional ssd to install ubuntu since the ssds are removable (if you are into web dev. of course)",4,4

Only answer I found, but it works, is remap the up arrow key to right shift.  A remap utility is available for download.  I tried for a week before doing that.

Yes, please.-20 seconds from fully shut down to desktop-Extremely light and portable. Also, doesn't make a sound, as it has no fans (don't worry, it doesn't get hot) or spinning HD.-Great battery life-Screen actually looks very nice for something this cheap. Viewing angles aren't great, and its only 720HD, but... $148.-Keyboard feels good and track pad is big and responsive"," -Seems a little flimsy, but again, $148-As others have said, the 32 gig SSD doesn't leave much room for software/storage. I had 20 gigs free after upgrading to Windows 10-Upgrading to Windows 10 was easy, but a WIFI driver issue I had afterwards was NOT (more details in ""Other""). However, that is not  the machine's fault, so I'm not docking a star for this."," I know people are going back and forth on whether or not it has enough room on its SSD to upgrade to Windows 10, but I didn't have any space issues. I upgraded without a usb-iso. Also, very glad Microsoft is still providing free upgrades to Windows 10, because just an hour of messing with Windows 8.1 on this was infuriating.However, after the upgrade, the wifi stopped working, and there is no ethernet port. Checked the adapter/drivers in device manager and it claimed to be up to date, but the adapter wouldn't 'start'. I used another computer to download the latest drivers from the Asus website, but these didn't work either. It appears this is a common problem with this machine's Broadcom Wifi adapter and Windows 10. I spent 2 hours searching for a more (or less, as some claimed older drivers fixed the problem) up-to-date driver and finally found one (version 5.93.103.4, if this happens to you) that worked. After that, everything was a breeze!Again, this is a refurbished budget machine, so you can't expect everything to be perfect. It would probably be helped by another 2 gigs of RAM and 64 bit OS, but whatever. It will be perfect for what I intend to use it for, which is checking email at work and travelling without the fear of getting an expensive laptop lost or broken.I had an Acer netbook from 2010 which I used and loved for a few years. This EeeBook improves upon everything that made my old one great. Just don't expect a real powerhouse, and you'll be satisfied.",1,1

Micro SD for expansion.As a refurb, the 32gb disk is wiped, so there is no recovery partition, and the Windows recovery tools don't work.

On the hardware side, the backlit keyboard is useful for dark areas (as well as showing off to family members). Plus it's pretty light. The screen can bend nearly all the way back, which is impressive but also kind of scary for those who aren't used to that kind of flexibility. The sound is great with the Dolby Digital Plus software that's pre installed. And the battery life isn't half bad either."," This laptop is far from perfect however, It's a windows 8 laptop, so the problems with OS that are still in effect here. However, the Classic Start Menu program I downloaded from the net made it much more useable. The touchpad is good, but not the most reliable. Sometimes it doesn't respond to movement unless you press hard on the pad. This happend on my old laptop too, so it may be an issue with my fingers... Anyway, the screen looks a bit ""off"" compared to normal laptops. And although it's 1080p, not all games will run well at that resolution. I'd also be lying if I said I was happy with only 3 usb ports, but I'm sure a USB hub will fix that problem. It has, for the record, only one audio jack that functions as a mic and a headphone jack. The headphone jack mode works, but each time you have to switch settings around in a menu to make sure it's on the right mode. It's annoying, especially when you are running full screen programs, plug something in, and get dumped to the desktop, but nothing I myself can't handle.

Plenty of HDD space for projects, video work, etc.  The Optimus Technology set up from nVidia takes a little to get used to swapping between a standard Intel graphics card and the nVidia GeForce mobile card; though this can be overcome by swapping between the cards when necessary.  While I haven't gamed with it, friends that have similar have relayed their satisfaction to me in case I ever decide to do some mobile gaming. Also surprising is that the picture didn't show that the keyboard has an under light (which has a smart shut off when on battery power).  Full 104-Keyboard and placement of the Touchpad makes it easier to type without fumbling with errant mouse clicks most of the time."," While the main body of the laptop is brushed aluminium finish, it's still plastic.  While I accept that sacrifices were made for the lightness of the laptop, the cover for the body of the main laptop (keyboard area) doesn't seem to be stuck to the body/guts of the laptop itself.  While looking at the keyboard straight on seems to be level, creates the sort of optical illusion of being warped/misshapen.  Typical Acer applets are bloatware though easy enough to remove  through add/remove programs.  McAffee also added and easily removed."," While I have never been a fan of the Metro Interface in Windows 8, seeing the Windows 10 icon a couple of weeks later is making it easy enough to tolerate until Windows 10 goes gold.

The sound is also decent compared to other laptops I have used. I was able to install Arch Linux on it with no problem after I disabled UEFI. I was able to utilize the dual GPU (Intel and NVIDIA) even though it is tricky with Linux. It supports 6 Gbps SATA (revision 3) if you have plans to change the hard drive."," Minus one egg because of the difficulty in upgrading the memory. It took a lot of time. The memory slots and hard drive are not easy accessible through a simple removable panel. The touchpad does not have physically separate left and right buttons and is a bit large for me, but I know some people like both of those feature.", I installed Arch Linux and upgraded the memory immediately after it arrived. Until there is better support for UEFI I would switch to the legacy BIOS boot to save yourself trouble if installing Linux. I never booted into Windows with this laptop. I probably spent more time tweaking the Synaptics touchpad config after installing the OS than anything else. Be prepared to edit your X11 config file. To upgrade the memory I used 16 GB of G.SKILL F3-1866C10D-16GRSL. It was no problem once I actually removed all the screws and disconnected multiple ribbons and cables to get to the memory slots.

9SIA0AJ34U2681,34-318-092,1/30/2015 8:03:17 PM,Jonathan C.,Great laptop for the price,4," Good specs, great screen resolution and brightness, good graphics, decent integrated speakers, easily customizable, strong build quality, 2 USB 3.0 ports, never gets loud or terribly hot, runs Ubuntu 14.04 flawlessly."," Very short battery life, hypersensitive touchpad, slow HDD, weak wireless card."," The Lenovo IdeaPad Z710 has a lot of things going for it. The Intel Core i7 processor can handle anything I want it to do with ease and never gets too hot or loud while working. The display is sharp but has a glossy finish, so if you use your laptop outdoors or in really bright rooms often, this will definitely bother you. The Intel Integrated HD card handles the desktop environment just fine, whereas the NVIDIA card takes over for the more graphics intensive processes, a job which it does quite well. However, I can't speak much about how well it runs PC games.The build quality of this laptop is excellent, as there is no flex to the case at all, even when putting a lot of pressure on the corners. That said, the chiclet style keyboard will depress a tiny bit, though this is hardly noticeable.If you are looking for a laptop that will run Linux, either alone or side-by-side with Windows, this laptop fits the bill perfectly. Every device on the laptop is supported by the kernel, so you shouldn't have any problems with compatibility.As for the negative aspects of this laptop, battery life is at the forefront. The battery can only withstand about 4 hours of web browsing and word processing before it needs to recharge. When streaming video or playing games, don't be surprised if the battery lasts less than two hours. A 4-cell battery was a poor design choice for a laptop with such a large screen and powerful CPU. If you plan on using your laptop away from an outlet regularly, you will definitely want to look elsewhere.Additionally, the touchpad is both too large and too sensitive. If you rest your palms while typing, you can be assured that you will accidentally brush the touchpad every so often. This can get annoying, but if you typically use a mouse, there are programs available that will disable the touchpad anytime a mouse is plugged in, alleviating the problem. The 5400 RPM hard drive can slow things down a bit, although this is not a surprising feature for a laptop in this price range. Finally, the wireless card in this laptop (Intel Wireless AC 7260), while fast, is also a bit under-powered. From the room adjacent to the one in which I set up my router, I only get 2-3 out of four bars of signal strength. For those in bigger houses, this might be an issue.All things considered, this laptop is probably best suited as essentially a mobile desktop, which is what I was wanting. I take this laptop with me to work, and I'm rarely away from an outlet for more than a few hours, so the battery life doesn't affect me too terribly much. I replaced the OEM hard drive with a Samsung EVO SSD, and the computer is stupidly quick now (boot times of 20 seconds for Windows and less than 10 seconds for Ubuntu), so I would seriously recommend swapping the hard drive out.Ultimately, there are a lot of things I love about this laptop, and only a few things I don't. If the problems aren't a deal breaker for you, this is one of the best laptops for",2,3

9SIA0AJ34U2681,34-318-092,12/22/2014 10:48:12 PM,Carlos A.,Strong Machine Given Specs,4," Given that the machine's got an onboard 840M, a mid-range Nvidia GPU, you're not going to get especially impressive graphical performance; with that said, the strong i7 chip coupled with a solid 8GB of Dual Channel RAM makes this machine good at running low-demand games like League of Legends at it's native 1920x1080 resolution. When it comes to more demanding games and processes, like render-heavy video/photo editing and games like Battlefield 4, the machine will begin to struggle--but this a given for almost all laptops at this price range.Though you shouldn't expect to run demanding next-gen games at high settings or perform extremely demanding tasks on this computer, you shouldn't expect the same of any laptop at the $800  price range.Outside of this, the laptop is excellent. The fast processor makes for seamless multitasking between low-demand programs (so your typical tasks like internet explorer, word, etc), video streams beautifully on a native full 1080p screen and it'll play most modern games at mid settings. The laptop is also good at light video/photo editing, but don't expect to be moving gigabytes of raw video data in and out of the laptop with much ease. For all practical purposes, the laptop is an excellent choice at this price-range. If you're looking for a high-end gaming/editing machine, I suggest moving your budget to the $1,100-1,400 price range--spending this little for tasks of that caliber will result in underwhelming performance."," There are two small issues with this laptop: the battery life is quite short given that it's a 4-cell battery powering strong hardware and the built in mousepad is, to me, a bit counter-intuitive. If short battery life is a deal-breaker for you, this is definitely NOT the laptop you'd want; battery life can be as short as 1 hour if you're running demanding programs. The mousepad takes some getting used to. Though it's definitely not a deal-breaker, you'll probably find yourself buying a separate  mouse for day-to-day use.",,3,4

It is extremely fast, especially when paired with a SSD.I really cannot explain how awesome this machine is. If you are looking for a low end gaming laptop or everyday laptop with some gaming, I HIGHLY recommend this machine. You aren't going to play Far Cry 4 on Ultra high settings, or even Skyrim. But you can play them on High settings with some other options tweaked down and still get a display that looks better then the PS3 :) I am very satisfied.", TrackPad Driver/Software (See other thoughts)," The trackpad sucks. Its not the hardware either cause using my Ubuntu build it is actually quite nice. But in Windows with the drivers installed, its very annoying.When you double tap and hold the second tap (similar to left mouse click down and hold) upon releasing your finger from the surface of the trackpad, a standard left click event is sent to whatever program you are using. So if you double tap and hold to select text, image or anything like that, upon releasing your finger, it sends a standard left click event clicking once on whatever your mouse was over. Thus, unselecting everything you just so precisely selected. Get a mouse if you plan on doing a lot of mouse work. I do a lot of programming so it only bothers me a bit. However, using your second hand to hold down the regular click still works fine.",3,3

It came with Windows 8 -- aka, the bane of anyone's existence. Thankfully the Windows 10 upgrade fixed a lot of the issues."," I'm not hard on my laptops. While I do carry them to/from work 5 days a week, I use a padded case, padded backpack, and I'm careful during transportation. This is my second ASUS. The first one lasted me 5 years... I'll be lucky to get a full year out of this one. Multiple screws have fallen out of the case. Replacing them isn't an option, as the screw holes are basically stripped. The face of the CD drive comes off all the time -- another missing screw perhaps?The worst issue is that despite gentle use, this computer now picks and chooses when it wants to turn on. About 75% of the time  time when I open the laptop (after being in sleep mode), it refuses to turn on at all. The power button is unresponsive, and none of the computer lights are on, despite the computer being plugged in and charged. This has caused multiple problems at work -- late for video conferences, printing out materials, etc. Thankfully I've discovered that if I plug/unplug between 20-50 times... it will suddenly turn on again.

I'd suffer in quiet dissatisfaction through the flimsy discount construction (you've probably gotten sturdier fast food containers) and the fact that it seems to have problems extending to other monitors at 1080p, if it wasn't for how absolutely frustrating the track pad is. The cursor likes to shift dramatically under the slightest pressure and the left/right buttons are part of the trackable area. So if you position the cursor over something, when you lower your finger onto the right-click area, it'll register it as movement before it registers it as a click-- so the cursor moves and you right-click somewhere else. Drag and drop: same problem. Scrolling? Same problem. (Two finger swipe-to-scroll works with IE, not in chrome. I guess that's a software issue and not a hardware issue, but due to the fact that I can't work around it by using trackpad ""normally"", I'm counting against the laptop itself.). The Fn key to disable the trackpad doesn't even work, so even when I plug a mouse in, the slightest motion of the trackpad while typing sends the screen into a frenzy of undesired activity."," Contrary to the experience of another user, I upgraded to Win10 the first day I got it with no heartache other than possibly losing any pre-installed track-pad disabling software. Whatever other bloat there may have been was wiped clean too, though.Final thoughts: I assumed at a $500 pricetag, I'd be getting a decent degree, and I just haven't seen that.

Black texture seems to pick up scratches and smudges really easily, particularly on the back of the screen.  Disappointing lack of an SSD"," I bought this laptop in August 2015 as a daily carry and light use PC for classes. When I first started it up I noticed two things, it made a surprising amount of noise for a new laptop, and it was riddled with bloatware. I fixed those issues as best I could and proceeded to carry it too and from classes for about 6 months now. Over that period of time it developed a number of issues. I began to notice screws falling out of the bottom of the PC, the keyboard dropping keystrokes fairly regularly, and the CD drive has locked up to the point where it won't open, and I'm afraid to force it. Another frustrating issue is the trackpad. Even at the beginning it wasn't great, but that was just a lack of responsiveness. Now it will occasionally stop working altogether, necessitating a reboot of the system. I've also noticed a drop in battery life. When I first got the computer I could get about 6 hrs of battery at medium screen brightness.

None of them have been perfect in every detail but very close!  If I wanted perfect I would order new and pay the premium.

I purchased this for a client, not only did they fall in love with it, but so did I. I was a little skeptical about purchasing from this seller but at the end of the day I did not regret it. product shipped quickly, it was well packaged, and it had a pristine cover and screen. It was clean on the inside, hard drive was running incredibly smooth and well (diagnostics said it didn't have much use)."," Although this product had many pros which I listed above, I have purchased hundreds of laptops for clients over the years, and this one had me concerned at first. I did mention the case was immaculate but upon opening the lid i realized someone had coated the laptops typing surface and palm rest in a protective layer of plastic. I promptly removed it as it made the product look cheap and of poor quality. I then removed the stickers that were for some reason placed on the keys to cover their damaged surface, not only did they look worse than the minor imperfections with the keyboard but they also ruined the aesthetics as the font on these stickers was hideous. The computer itself ran perfectly fine, so I am rating it based on that, but it was preloaded with Windows 7 home premium which I quickly removed. the windows that came preloaded had this odd feel to it, it was also branded by the reseller which was not okay with me. the cons have less to do with the units itself and more to do with what the seller did to the product to polish it up, which was a bad call in my opinion. One other issue I had is the plastic covers beside the battery compartment that shield the Ethernet jack just randomly fell off. I fixed it with some adhesive but this isn't new so it's no big deal. *****IMPORTANT*****one issue many may experience, especially those with little to no tech experience is that IF and only IF you install Windows 8, the system itself will attempt to download drivers for the video. this will cause the screen to go black. this is a common issue with this specific model as there is an issue with the driver, not the product. if you have this issue go to the manage devices tab and uninstall the video driver. this will solve that issue. a few notes for those wondering what it comes with or doesn't come with: -No fingerprint scanner -No webcam (its a security issue with most enterprises) -The speakers are NOT for regular use. When using these laptops for audio processing you're usually supposed to use a digital output or the 3.5mm port if it is all you have. -No serial port -No HDMI (only displayport out and D-SUB) "," The product itself was great, there were no cosmetic issues or hardware issues aside from the battery only lasting 20 minutes. I purchased a 12 cell battery for this laptop from a third party seller that supplied 6-8 hours of continuous use on the ""performance"" setting in windows power manager. so overall great product. I love the design. it works well, runs extremely smooth with Windows 7 and 8. I'd recommend this to anybody in need to a business laptop and I will maybe purchase a few more in the future depending on the clients needs.",None,None

I never had to use customer services, until today.  The WiFi network card in my replacement E6410 (it got very difficult to type the keys of the 1st one after 15-30 mins of use, I guess it was because of the heat from battery) was not connected.  This problem should have been spotted and corrected in QC but it was not.  I am certainly disappointed on 2 failed units.However I do have great appreciation for Patricia of customer service for working with me to return the replaced unit and sending out another replacement unit - I am hoping it will work this time.  What Patricia did is to keep an old customer - I have been with New Egg for many many years.  It is certainly very disappointing to have the replaced unit failing - particularly this is a birthday gift for a dear old friend.  But Patricia shows New Egg is a responsible company with great staff to serve customers.  And that is the reason why I will continue to be a loyal customers.  The ability to right the wrong is the commitment to customers, and Patricia shows me just how good New Egg is!  I hope Patrica is recognized for what she did and her supervisor should be proud of her.  Thank you, Patricia!"," Although the items I purchased this time (my 2nd time and 1st time was a a different but excellent unit) is a refurbished one and probably sold by 3rd party (maybe not by New Egg.  It should not failed two times in a row.  Particularly the problem of the WiFi of the 2nd unit should have been spotted prior to shipment.  It would have saved New Egg shipping cost, customer service cost, and even reputation.  If the unit is supplied by a third party, New Egg, to keep the hard earned reputation, should consider stopping using this vendor until its QC catches up.  However, if the units are supplied by New Egg directly, then New Egg needs to plug this whole by improving QC of units prior to shipment."," In summary, I am disappointed with the QC of the units (two units) while very grateful for Patricia of Customer Service - her excellent service and efforts save a loyal customer for New Egg.

It was in decent shape, but had some signs of use. The mounting hardware for the lid/screen was somewhat loose. The battery tested quite low, according to Dell's software. However, the computer booted-up without any problems when plugged-in to the included AC adapterThe computer came pre-loaded with MS Office 7, which was fine with me, since that was the version still being taught where my friend was taking an introductory computer class.NewEgg offered special low cost deals on MS Office subscription and on Norton Anti Virus.  That was a nice extra bonus. I purchased both later and installed them on the new computer.The computer is easier than most to add RAM to, and to install a new hard drive.A DVD and CD drive is included as is an HDMI connector. It lacked some features such as the backlit screen (optional for this model) but has more features overall than some computers built in the same era (mine was manufactured in 2011)."," After installing the MS Office and and Norton anti-virus software, the computer ran quite slowly especially at startup and a wait of a few minutes before proceeding into application programs was necessary. So, I first replaced the standard 4 GB RAM memory with 8 GB. That made some difference, but the computer still started up really slowly and certain programs such as Adobe Acrobat Reader had problems opening files without slowing down and freezing. Internet Explorer was also really slow. I suspect that the anti-virus software may have had something to do with the slowdown."," I later replaced the 320 GB hard drive with a new Crucial 525 GB hard drive. That made a HUGE amount of difference. The machine now works and responds like a newer computer with very little delay. All three internet browsers (Internet Explorer, FireFox and Chrome) work quickly.  The computer appears to run a little cooler and there is less noise. Startup with Windows 7 is quite fast.I also updated some of the drivers to the latest ones that Dell offered on their website.I also bought a new battery, but haven't used it yet. For now, the computer will be used mostly as a plug-in computer.The computer now works well and will hopefully work for a year or two for my friend. But if I had to do things over, I just would have bought a new computer. I spent too much time and additional money upgrading this computer.It is unclear how well this computer will run Windows 10. Some users report success. But from what I've read, It appears that Windows 10 is not officially supported on this model, and that some features may not work properly when the Windows 10 upgrade is done. Do a Google search of ""Dell Latitude E6420"" and ""Windows 10"" to find out more.I would recommend this computer because it does work well and has good features. But perhaps it it best suited to someone who has access to RAM and an SSD at low cost, or already has these items laying around on their hobby bench.",None,None

I did not mind that, as it was a C-grade refurbishment. Everything worked, including the speakers and headphone jack.  Unfortunately, the unit I received had the problems listed above (loose hinges, loose power port, and battery in poor health). I returned it. The process was pretty quick and easy via telephone with Newegg, and the replacement laptop arrived six days later. Note that I had to send back the original laptop before they would ship out the replacement. The whole process was six days.The second laptop is in much better condition than the first. The exterior is almost entirely blemish-free, and it still had the original Intel and Windows stickers on the palm rest. Apart from a little wiggle in the power port, all ports are nice and tight. The USB ports are like new. Additionally, the second unit came with a modem (which I will never use--the first one just had a blank cover over this port). It also came with the dual Intel/nVidia graphics cards, which is an upgrade from the last one. The hinges are tight, and the battery is in ""moderate"" health. I was able to install Windows 10 on it with no problems.Overall, I am happy with the replacement, and am going to keep it. I would rate the condition of the first unit at 2 stars, and the replacement at 4. The customer service was good, but the whole process was a bit of a hassle.

Some have been in the field for a number of months without any issues. We have tried various brands to supply to our sales guys, and the E5xx series holds up well.- fairly solid build. There is some flex in the body, but nothing like some of the other brands have in this price range. - easy to upgrade. There is one large latch at the bottom to change the HDD and add some more memory. (We switched all the cheap Seagate drives with SSD's right away and upgraded the memory to 8GBs. I noticed the last few we received all have WD Blacks now, which is a nice change)- good performance. I say 'good', not excellent for a reason. These laptops will be great performers for most daily tasks (especially with an SSD), but don't think you will be impressed with gaming and re-encoding videos on these."," - touch pad. Like some other reviewers have mentioned, the touch pad click does not register well. The hardware buttons above it work like a charm though.- 2 of the laptops had to be sent back because of bad video cables. Must have been a bad batch of them, since they had the same issue. Wasn't a big issue for us, since Lenovo took care of it promptly. But I can see how this would be an issue for those who would be pressed for time. Took an egg off for the QC. These units were DOA."," If you want to be happy with this purchase, spend some extra $ on a 250GB or 500GB SSD. I personally found the Micron (Crucial MX) drives a good value, but whatever tickles your fancy. Also, the move to 8GB will not just increase your memory size, but will move you to dual channel as well. So an additional memory stick would be good too. (I found them to be using a SAMSUNG 4GB PC3L - 12800S with CAS 11, so anything that matches that should be good.) So in summary, these are good value oriented offerings from Lenovo.",1,1

Laptop shipped with Windows 7 pro pre-installed.  Once turned on, I tried to check Windows 7 update.  The update took forever, never ending.  Googled for solution.  There is really no solutions that can resolve this issue.  I managed a few updates installed by a suggestion using msconfig to disable a Windows service.  However, this approach does not resolve automatic Check Windows Update issue.  Nearly a week past, the machines are still running Check Windows Update.  Even worse, I called Lenovo Support to request Win 10 pro media that the document says consumer of this machine is entitled.  I found a few days later, the order has been canceled for the reason Lenovo would not say.  Re ordered yesterday.  Still no confirmation of shipping tracking is provided which Lenovo promised to send with 24 hrs.  Really tired of this.I would not recommend to buy this.",,2,9

Lets be realistic when reliability is key AMD is not going to be the best option especially for Linux users.-No m2 addon card support-FN Key is in the bottom right, which is extremely annoying-The mouse touch pad click sucks. The hardware buttons make up for it."," I have recommended this exact model a handful of times. I actually bought an open box and have minimal regrets. The screen has some weird shading in the size of a windows COE sticker, but Last time i sent in an open box for repair they kept is so eventually Ill just upgrade the screen myself to a 1920x1080 panel. According to the Googles its a 30 dollar panel and not much work at all.Right away before I even used this machine I doubled the Ram, added a ssd, used a caddy to replace the optical drive with a 2tb platter drive, and setup the Dock. The dock is recognized ootb in Fedora 24, as is the finger print scanner. I have no real gripes aside from the configuration options, as such I have already upgraded to a Lenovo P50 for more power.

I needed to get a personal laptop so chose this model. It is very much like my previous Lenovo which was exactly what I wanted. I have used it for a few weeks and am very happy with the purchase.

I know what she uses a computer for and I know what she needs.  This computer packs the epic Sandy Bridge based i5 processor which still packs more than enough horsepower for everyday computer tasks.  The computer was in excellent shape and looked like it had been hardly used.  There are no dead pixels on the screen and the Windows 8 install upgraded to Windows 10 no problem.  The battery holds a charge just as expected and my mom has owned it for about a month now without any problems at all.," The product took some time to ship from the retailer.  I am pretty sure they were pretty busy due to the holiday season.  Irregardless the product arrived on time and it was well packaged and safe so kudos to them; however, the length of time it took it to ship made me a little nervous.  Also - there is no finger print reader on the model of computer that i received.  That is the only problem with the product that I received but I don't really care because my mom would never be able to figure it out anyways and it would be just one more thing I would have to trouble shoot for her as soon as she messed it up.  I am removing one star simply because that part of the product description is wrong."," I picked up this laptop with a free carrying bag for 199.99 on a Newegg.com daily deal.  For around 200 dollar shipped I was able to pick up a nice laptop that my mom is going to be able to use for years.  This laptop is also stupid easy to upgrade.  I dropped another 4 gigs of RAM in it in less than 5 minutes.  The entire bottom of the laptop comes off with the push of locking latch.  Everything is right there - hard drive, DVD-ROM, memory, even the wireless networking radio is all open and easy to access for upgrades.  With the extra memory Windows 10 64bit feels fast.  I will probably drop an upgraded solid state drive into it at some point (simply because I anticipate my mom will drop it).

The only thing I did out of the box was to replace the memory it came with, with two 4 GB SO-DIMMS (CORSAIR 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3 1066 (PC3 8500) Memory for Apple Model CMSA8GX3M2A1066C7) which, of course, I ordered from NewEgg at a great price.  Needless to say, the MacBook runs fast with the added memory.  Considering this is potentially a three year old unit (a MacBook 6,1 - released late 2009), it's speed is definitely usable and I intend to upgrade it to Mountain Lion (i.e.  Apple's site indicates that it qualifies)."," As mentioned, the refurbished unit is functionally perfect and arrived with the screen and keyboard showing no cosmetic imperfections or signs of wear.  However, the outside of the case and the screen cover are a different story.  The bottom of the case has discolored yellow blotches on it, as well as a red area where it looks like someone tried to wipe the case bottom (the case bottom is actually a removable cover) with a red cloth trying to clean something off the case bottom.  Also, the top of the case has many minor scratches.  Overall, you can tell this was a used item that has been functionally refurbished, but not cosmetically.  I didn't expect this from a NewEgg sales offering."," I re-read NewEgg's definition of a refurbished product, and while it implies that a product may have been used, it doesn't say that unit may be delivered with cosmetic imperfections and/or non-functional blemishes.  Also, I interpreted the description as implying that the unit is refurbished by the manufacturer...  That lead me to believe that these were units refurbished by Apple.  I've purchased Apple refurbished products in the past and they looked and functioned as if they were new.  So, that's the type of product I thought I was going to receive.  While I intend to keep this unit because it's 100% functional, I don't think I will buy another refurbished product from NewEgg.",8,9

I'm glad I made this decision. Comes with a power adapter and a few sheets of paper with the instructions. Windows 7 key is on the bottom of the laptop.The laptop I received was in very good condition, I would grade it a ""B"" or ""B+"". I may have been a bit lucky due to some or the prior customers' reviews. This laptop shipped from New Jersey. No goo or junk in the ports or on the sides. The keyboard still is springy and has a fresh feeling. The screen has no scratches and is immaculate. Ethernet and wifi and bluetooth all work fine.Upon set up, the minimum processor state is set to 100% when plugged in. This gets the fan going, so you must adjust this. This laptop can get fairly hot if you don't. This Dell booted up fine the first time. Installed some updates to get it ready for the Windows 10 upgrade, cloned the hard drive to an 480gb OCZ ssd and swapped them and began setting up Win10 as we speak. No problems. I'll upgrade the ram soon.Great laptop for the money. A good beginner book for a student on a budget or someone who is waiting for the price to fall on those sexy thin/ flex notebooks. This Dell e6410 belongs on a desk to work on, on your lap it will get too hot and maybe too cumbersome in the time of ipads/tablets. Processor alone can cost $70.Free Windows 10 upgrade until July 29 seals the deal, so hurry. :)"," Gets  a bit warm, but this is a previous generation laptop...", this laptop has great value for being a little more than $100. I would buy another unit if I had extra cash lying around.,1,1

I have to say that Newegg was wise in selecting JoySystems as one of their refurb companies: they have done a GREAT job on this.  Remember, these are Grade C refurbs, so they will not be perfect.  The laptop came with a fair amount of scratches, missing screw, spots where it was obvious stickers used to sit, grainy stickers on the keys (nice ones) to make them sharp/readable as the keyboard was heavily used, and things of such cosmetic nature.  What it did NOT have was any blemishes on the screen, which was my biggest concern.  Software was a clean load of Win 64 bit home, which is just fine.  Upgrades to Windows 10 with no problems.  It is a refurb license, but it really makes no difference."," standing behind their product, despite the fact that they are under no obligation whatsoever to help with a battery.  Nice.   Not really a con, but more a warning:  There should be no issues with the software, but be aware that this is a grade C laptop.  Keep your expectations low, your skill level high, and you will be rewarded!"," I wish I could select suppliers of these refurbs.  There are some great companies (like this one), with outstanding customer service, and a willingness to get the professional end user what they need to get the job done.  I would give 6 eggs if I could.  Great job.",6,7
9SIA0AJ43C3622,34-298-770,8/4/2016 11:19:00 AM,Anonymous,"Very, very good laptop for the price",5," There's a lot to like here.- Current gen quad core i5- The 960M isn’t going to blow you away but it’s decent enough to play most games of 2015 and similar at a mix of medium/high settings at acceptable frame rates.  Additionally, Dell gave it *4GB* of DDR5 vram, instead of the usual 2gb of DDR5 or even DDR3 you find in this price range.  That's great for newer games and open world games that benefit from more GPU memory.- Very easy for the end user to service - single screw access to all the internals is NICE.- Good upgrade options.  You have a free M.2 SSD slot and a free ram slot, so a couple of simple and cheap upgrades can give you a great spec boost that puts you in line with models that cost several hundred dollars more.-A number of small things that add up: backlit keyboard with a couple of brightness settings, number pad on the keyboard, big battery, red accents give it a good but not overly aggressive look, IPS panel instead of a TN panel, huge rubber feet on the bottom that really work well to keep the laptop from slipping and help with ventilation, indication light on the charger end so you can see if it’s got power, very little bloatware, etc.  It’s a bunch of things that taken on their own might not be a big deal, but together make a pretty compelling bunch of bells and whistles."," It’s not perfect.  To get to this price dell had to cut some corners, and it shows.  Many of these are nitpicky and they obviously don't affect my overall satisfaction with the laptop, but you should be aware of the drawbacks.- Stock HDD is slow, specially for gaming applications.  Do yourself a favor and buy an M.2 SSD (2280 size) when you buy this laptop, and install it right away.  Make a recovery image of Windows on a USB or something and install it on the SSD, then wipe the HDD and use it for bulk storage.- The trackpad is serviceable at best.  You will get used to its quirks eventually (and it does take some getting used to), but it’s not a great option.  If you can, bring a mouse.  Likewise, the keyboard is OK (better than the track pad) but it won’t be winning any awards.- DDR3L memory instead of DDR4.  In the grand scheme of things this is a minor issue; I’m aware that for now at least, gaming really doesn’t see a benefit from DDR4.  Still, it would have been nice to see Dell future-proof this part since the CPU is built for it, and especially since they went the extra mile to future-proof the GPU ram.  On the plus side, DDR3L is faster and lower voltage than regular old DDR3, so it’s acceptable.- The screen, while IPS, has color reproduction issues (look at some of the professional reviews online for more in-depth analysis), which would probably make it unsuitable for photo editing and the like.  For gaming, I haven’t found it to be an issue.  Additionally, some light bleed at the edges is noticeable when the image is very dark.  Again, for gaming I haven’t had problems.- Stock wireless card is slow, and for me at least it had connectivity issues.  This is definitely an area where Dell went for budget over performance.  I upgraded it to an Intel 7265 which costs about $20 and is super easy to replace (thanks, single screw internal access!).  No more problems.- Sound is OK (gets loud but tends to wash out at higher volumes), but the “subwoofer” is a joke and might as well not exist as far as bass is concerned.  Also, they put the sub off center, so it can seem like more sound is coming from one side than the other.  All in all, plan on using headphones if you can.- No cutting edge ports.  Here again, Dell decided to cut some corners to keep the price low.  The included ports are adequate, but you won’t find Thunderbolt, USB 3.1, or DisplayPort options here.- No optical drive.  Not a huge issue for most people anymore I’m guessing, but if you want to use this to play DVDs and the like you’ll have to buy an external.- Don’t plan on gaming on battery.  Battery life while doing intensive gaming sucks, and framerate takes a nosedive.  Also, battery gaming sometimes produces a weird rubber band framerate effect where it will mostly be OK but every few seconds it will drop down to a single digit slideshow for an instant.  Makes the experience unplayable."," In summary, this is a great laptop for the price, probably the best in this entire price range.  You can find this base model for about 750 to 800 on the regular, and at that price other companies are often giving you a weaker CPU or GPU, or both.  Plus, the 4 gigs of DDR5 ram on the graphics card is a unicorn at this price.  Just spending an extra hundred bucks on a small m.2 SSD and extra ram stick will give you specs and gaming performance on par with most gaming laptops in the 1,100-1,300 dollar range - and you only spent 850 to 900 total with the upgrades.  Just be aware that some corners were cut to keep the price in the basement.  In my estimation, the benefits so far outweigh the downsides that those downside are easy to overlook.If you are looking for a machine that will give you entry- to mid-level performance in gaming while you are away from your desktop rig, while also doing general mobile computing and surfing very well, you can’t do much better than this.",4,5

I easily added 8gb of RAM( $30 USD) and a 250gb Samsung m.2 SSD($90USD) to beef this laptop up! Samsungs software made transferring the OS super easy to do. Google this laptop and how to upgrade, there is a great video that walks you through the process.*  Backlit led keyboard, keys dim after inactivity to safe battery life* The keys feel good, I don't have any issues with the keyboard"," * The trackpad really does suck, it feels like when I stop, the cursor still slides a bit. It feels, a little slippery, not in a tactile way, but in how it performs. My finger doesn't slide, but the cursor moves about .3 inches further than I want, so I need to sort of brake ahead of time. Really, this track pad is the worst I've ever used. It is passable but it takes getting used to and really, is the worst part of the laptop imo. The buttons themselves on the track pad aren't a problem, it's one of those kinds where the whole thing is a button, you don't feel the left or right click buttons, they're marked but the whole thing is flat. In that regard, the trackpad is fine, it's merely the ""slipperiness"" of it that bothers me.* There is some screen bleeding toward the bottom, you only notice it on an all black screen."," All in all, this Laptop is a very good middle of the road laptop that can play games. It isn't very heavy, it's pretty slender and upgrading it/accessing it's innards is easier than any other laptop I've had. One screw is all it takes to get inside and access most of the important stuff. For an extra $120 or so, you can double it's RAM to 16gb, throw in an m.2 SSD (Sata not PCI!) and transfer your OS onto that easily with the samsung software. (if you get a samsung SSD). They cut some corners with the trackpad, and screen quality but those are the corners I'd rather they cut, than put in a bad processor or gpu. Assuming you're playing anything worth having a gpu for, you'll be using a mouse anyway. The screen quality isn't something I can really notice. The bleeding is, like I said earlier, only noticeable on a fully black screen, in action it has never been an issue for me.All in all, this is a 4 out of 5 egg laptop, the trackpad definitely makes it lose an egg because it truly is annoying to use, and unfortunately for me, a lot of what I want to do with it involves the trackpad, but for the most part, this is an affordable, mid range laptop that, of all the choices at the time of writing , is the laptop that was the best option available. Unless all you do is use a trackpad, I would recommend this laptop without hesitation.",6,6

N82E16834154262,34-154-262,1/2/2017 9:35:08 AM,David W.,Great hardware specs - software has a few bugs,3, The device is very slim and light weight.  The build quality is good.  Very high end and hard to find specs such as Thunderbolt in a reasonably priced package.," The USB ports seem a bit finicky.  I bought an external CD-ROM drive and noticed it was being repeatedly detected by Windows as being plugged in and unplugged.  So, I moved the cable in the port slightly and it again was unplugged/plugged in Windows.  So, I presume this will be a constant issue - if I find other USB peripherals/devices having this problem then I will likely return the device for a refund.The slim bits of aluminum around the ports near the bottom of the case seems to bend outward from the device after very little use.  On my device it's the USB3 port closest to the SD card slot that is bowed out slightly.  This is the same apparent design flaw that I saw from another purchaser on their Ethernet port which they had assumed may have been done during their upgrade of the M2 drive - apparently not as I have not opened the case at all.  Considering my USB problems (above), I'm starting to wonder if the device is lacking enough structural integrity to handle being lifted from one corner.  I suspect that the case flexes a bit causing the aluminum to bend and possibly causing damage to the circuitry beneath.The keyboard has very awkward key placement (arrow keys half under standard keys and half under number pad, duplicate backslash keys, smaller number pad keys, non-standard windows key placement - can be swapped in the BIOS, etc.) that I still haven't gotten used to after two weeks.  I'm also not a fan of the design of the backlit keyboard.  I prefer keys that only light the letters as apposed to the edges which I find distracting.  But, that is a personal preference and I can see how some of the gamers out there would prefer the design as it is.The ""stutter"" problem many have documented is a real problem.  It seems much better after wiping the system and reloading from scratch - so it's most certainly a software/driver issue of some kind.  However, the system now won't shutdown properly half of the time (it powers back on after powering off).  I contacted support regarding this and they said it was likely a Windows update and requested I reload the system to stock software and settings using the recovery media.  Considering the problem occurs after the OS has been unloaded and it is inconsistent, I feel like this is a sledge hammer approach that may resolve the problem, but is no better than rebuilding a house with squeaky floor."," While the ""straight out of the box"" experience would be great for casual users, that is not the audience/demographic this device is targeting.  The power users and gamers who buy this device will be a bit frustrated trying to get the system to meet their expectations, but if they can indeed push through that frustration and smooth off the rough edges, it will serve them well - assuming the structural integrity problems I hypothesized above are not fact.",None,None

I am a little tech savvy so I looked up the possible reasons and updated a wireless driver to fix it. That was all well and good, but then I got another bsod for an entirely different issue. I managed to get that one to stop after downloading nvidia drivers, but then the laptops microphone and audio quit working. I got them fixed, but then the bsod came back. I found an older driver and got all of that working... I think. Then a super high pitched sound started coming from the upper right corner of the laptop. My graphics cards clock speed kept shooting up and down and I couldn't get it to stop doing that. The high pitched sound matched the clock movement of the graphics card. I tried so hard to love this laptop. I spent days trying to get it to act right. Every time I got one thing working though, something else would quit."," Besides the software issues, the screen was one of the worst I have ever seen.

I have people with their fancy macbooks turning their heads when they see the multicolored keyboard illuminate. It definitely beats the competitors to the looks department. It seems the competition hired designers from the 70's trying to envision how future electronics would look like in the year 2000. Performance is comparable to a GTX 970 which is impressive considering that laptops of last year were half the power at twice the size and weight. The typing experience on this laptop feels fluid. I would have no problems using this keyboard to type a paper for school. I can's say the same thing about the trackpad though. There is just too much force needed to click and the accidental right click all too often. I would recommend programming the two finger gesture the click function.Battery life is about as good as my previous  i5-5200u Zenbook. I can squeeze 4 hours max with eco mode turned on. The only major gripe I have isn't with this notebook but the poor customer service. When I had a question about setting the displayport to refresh at 144hz, the representative seriously told me buy another laptop because he couldn't find the answer to my question. What a joke! I would would suggest trying to get a third party warranty instead of buying directly from these guys.",1,2

Disabling it would cause the DPS latency to normalize.-Second unit still had stutters, not as occurrent compared to the first but it is there. Killer 1535 is still causing the the issue. Although, it seldom occurs. This brings me to think there's more to it than the wifi card. I did not bother to look any further.-see Chunpi J's review below. Could probably be connected to the high DPC latency issue caused by Killer 1535?Biggest gripe here is that these issues can easily be mistaken as ""ok"" to people.

Bad Kingston memory??," Whatever happened to quality control!? Recent purchases with electronics has been nothing short of frustrating. Bad pixels on Dell S2715DG (7 out 9 had problems and had to be return/exchanged just to get 2 good ones) and razer keyboards with sticky keys 2 out 4. And now 2 out 2 for the MSI GS63VR has bad memory. Sorry for the rant, but this has been most frustrating.My first GS63VR seemed alright at first. Ran game benchmarks fine, gets the expected scores for the GTX1060. But then it started to random blue screen. One time it even corrupted the windows 10 install and wouldn't boot. That is when decided to really check things. Run memtest86 (passmark memtest ver 7.1 latest as of now) and within minutes it was spewing errors in excess of 60K+ all over the place. Needless to say this thing when back to Best Buy.So now on to my second GS63VR. Runs memtest86 for a full 4/4 pass no error. You'd think things are good right? Install all the other software games, etc. But now that I've been nervous about things, I run more memtest overnight. I get 1 error out of 8 passes of memtest86. Run it again on another night, no errors. Try it again on another night and I get another error out of 8 passes of memtest86, this time at test 7 in contrast to test 13. For couple I try just hammering test 7 and 13 and I get no errors. Try it another night, I get 1 error at the same address location for 1 out the 8 passes again.What is someone supposed to do about this kind of intermittent error that is just so hard to find? Has anyone else encountered memtest86 errors on their GS63VR? Is this common place? Has MSI picked a bad supplied in these Kingston MSI24D4S7S8MB-8 DDR4-2401 memory? To date I've not had a single blue screen or abnormal windows behavior in my regular day time use when I am not testing the memory.I really wish there was way to change the wait states, fall back to say cas latency 18, or bump the voltage or something to work around this. I noticed that my first GS63VR was running with bios version E16K2IMS.10A whereas the second one is running the slightly older E16K2IMS.109. So it make me really nervous as to whether if I should even attempt to go to E16K2IMS.10A which may just screw myself over and cause the memory to fail in lots of places. Any advice, guidance, or moral support is welcome.BTW thanks for letting me rant.",None,None
N82E16834154262,34-154-262,11/24/2016 8:18:44 AM,Abhinav D.,Does shatter desktop performance!,5," -Very lightweight and thin! My previous laptop from 5 years ago was super powerful but weighed at least thrice as much as this does. I was surprised at how light this was, even though I had seen the weight specs beforehand. I haven't made an actual measurement to comment on how close or far it is from the company stated weight-Love the colors on the display. I've always used anti-glare display, so that was a must-have feature for me. The screen has a very wide viewing angle too -The fan is very quiet. I needed something I could take to meetings without it sounding like a lawn mover and attracting everyone's attention, while also being able to run heavy CFD simulations, generate detailed renderings and play games when required. I haven't been disappointed with this machines on any of those fronts so far.-Even with very heavy workloads, the laptop hasn't shown temperature reading of over 70 C, and no part of it was uncomfortable to touch. The felt lining on the underside helps a lot too.-Battery life has been better than expected. The company claimed 2 hours. While I haven't tried gaming on battery, under usual office workloads, I have been able to get 5-6 hours out of it.-The touchpad is very responsive. I thought it was a little too responsive initially but I guess making adjustments to sensitivity and getting used to it has helped. (See cons section too)-Lots of connection options. I was waiting for the MBP to come out so that I could decide between this and the MBP, but that was this year's biggest joke!-Keyboard (See in the Cons section too) - Love the travel and feedback from the keys. They are not very noise and clickity-clackity either"," -Keyboard - This might not be a con for everyone, but I would have preferred a more professional looking font for lettering, especially because I take it to work and conferences too. I did know what it looked like before buying, and it doesn't look that bad in person, but I went for the laptop anyway because nothing else came close in terms of performance and portability and I wasn't going to let the lettering be a deciding factor.-Touchpad - I would have preferred distinct left-and-right click keys. Being able to get the right click working took a lot of tries and it still doesn't always work, especially if you have another finger somewhere else on the touchpad.-The fans sometimes whine when they are running at high speeds, but it's still not loud, just a little irritating if the room itself is very silent.-The laptop also makes weird sounds when the charger is connected to it, but it's fully charged. Again a very low-intensity sound, but can be irritating. It seems to come somewhere from the grill on top of the keyboard, but I'm not sure what exactly is making the sound. It goes away as soon as I disconnect the charger. The sounds are low enough such that you won't notice them at all if you're wearing headphones, even low-priced ones (Newegg won't let me use the word I wanted to describe them :P)-The red trim around the touchpad can be a little distracting sometimes, mostly because it is shiny and reflective and tends to reflect overhead lights straight into your eyes when working on a table.-Came with a lot of bloatware. I did a clean install (and upgrade) of Windows and reinstalled drivers and utilities from MSI's website-The body is a fingerprint magnet!"," -Screen - The screen is manufactured by LG. Some other websites claim washed out colors on the LG screen (at least on the Best Buy model) and it seems that some models ship with a Samsung display instead. I have absolutely no complaints regarding the color, though. I haven't done a hardware calibration on the screen so far to give actual numbers.-Storage - I immediately replaced the HDD with a 1TB Evo 850 SSD, so I again cannot comment on how fast the HDD would have been. I'm using it in an external enclosure as a backup drive though and get about 30 MBPS write speed. For those interested, it was manufactured by Seagate. Some others seem to have received HGST drives.-I chose this over the 4K version of the laptop for battery life concerns and for running legacy software without glitches.",1,1

Super thin for the amount of power this laptop offers. Despite its actual size and weight, when it is open and running, it feels a little bigger than it actually is.-The SteelSeries keyboard is becoming my favorite part of MSI laptops, or laptops in general. The GT72 I had before this had soft press keys which were awesome, but this keyboard has a little more resistance to the keys and I am finding it to be much better with the feedback because it lets me know I did indeed press that key. I was also worried about the keyboard being really scrunched together when deciding on buying the GS63 over the 73 but that is not the case at all. It is spread out with a decent amount of space between keys so I don't have the issue of pressing a couple at once like I have with other laptop keyboards of this size. -The display is very clean and colorful. Viewing angle is amazing because of the anti-glare coating and the screen color configurations also help.-The touchpad is responsive and good looking. Has the left/right click at the bottom and a page scroller on the right side. This was a pleasant find for me because most other laptops I have owned either had two buttons separate from the touchpad and/or did not have a scrolling function. -This laptop runs cool under load. You might have to crank up the fan speed settings but it does the job it is supposed to do while gaming or working. (Caution though:: I would recommend getting an extra laptop cooler to go underneath if you plan on extended periods of gaming, because after awhile, it does tend to get pretty warm)-Tons of connectivity options as stated in specs.-This laptop has ripped through most games I have tested on it, at max settings:: Metro: Last Light, World of Warcraft, Witcher 3, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Dying Light, DOOM, and GTA V. (*See Cons and/or Other*)-The battery I found lasts a decent amount of time. From my experience of bringing it to lectures all day everyday for a good couple of weeks, it will last about 5ish hours on battery saver with light coding/web browsing. It is quick to recharge, about an hour and a half.-Comes with a bunch of useful software from MSI. (Dragon Center)-The bottom of the laptop has a layer of felt, which was a great touch for when the laptop is on my lap, it does not slide off as easily. (Does not make the laptop even warmer)"," -My biggest beef with this laptop is the storage. Absolutely underwhelming. HDD at 5400RPM is a joke. 128GB M.2 SSD is great, but almost solely as a boot drive and barely able to add much else. Before I was able to even allow this machine to play games on it, I had to replace the HDD with an SSD. Otherwise people who buy this would have a hard time getting those max settings on heavy games even with incredible hardware elsewhere. -The power button is in an odd place. I am going to place this in the cons section because I know some people might find this really annoying. At first, I was always hitting the power button because I am just used to it being up above the keyboard. After awhile I was able to finally be more aware of where the new power button was and hit it less often. You get used to it and it really only puts your laptop to sleep which is not a big deal.-""What battery?"" -says laptop while gaming. Unless you are playing a less demanding game, you should always have this plugged in for gaming.-A surprising amount of people care about how loud their fans are, so I will put this down here just in case. Since this laptop is insanely thin, the fans installed had to be insanely thin. At very fast speeds, the fans have a slight shrill sound to them. To me, it is not super obnoxious but I can see how it would bother some others. -With every pre-built PC or laptop, you will have to do a bit of cleaning on the OS."," I also chose this model over the 4K version because the card in this laptop is not capable of running the Benchmark games at a playable fps at 4K. The connectivity allows you to hook up to a 4K monitor with great speeds if you ever feel the need to watch videos or just surf the web at 4K. -This laptop does support SATA III 6Gb/s so if you replace the HDD with an SSD 2.5"", it will run at full speeds (Read/Write). The laptop also supports NVMe PCIe x4 M.2 SSD which will also run at full Read/Write speeds. I would absolutely recommend replacing AT LEAST the HDD with a decent size SSD. This is the biggest upgrade you can make to this laptop. I ended up replacing both because the M.2 SSD that comes with the laptop is not NVMe. I used a 500GB for the SSD and a 512 for the NVMe M.2 both Samsung. (850 Evo and 950 Evo Pro).I am going to school for computer engineering and software engineering so I needed something compact and light but also able to do some work under load. It has made schoolwork a breeze and when free time eventually rolls around, this laptop has made gaming on the go very convenient. I would absolutely recommend getting this laptop.

It handles a modern fps on very low settings.The sound is a ""better than expected"" thing.It's not sexy unless you understand the specs. It's big. It's heavy. It has a VGA port.

One can always plug in a separate good quality webcam, but the built in camera is not as good as the standard cell phone these days."," I would recommend this to anyone who wants an overall great performer at a reasonable price.  I did not compare battery life with other laptops in this price range, so no comment there.

My wife needs to have a good webcam to video conference but we will returning this machine due to the webcam being so low quality.  I was shocked and extremely disappointed.  Tried contacting ASUS support to see if there was a driver I was missing but the download link I was sent to showed no improvement.  I'm reluctant to return the machine because its such a powerful laptop, but we need a decent webcam.

The keyboard is great and is one of the best keyboards I have used on a laptop. It has some resistance when typing which I prefer and also has a clicky feel to it like a mechanical keyboard.

Amazingly fast on the SDD.Radeon R7 (built into the A12 APUs) and a separate R7, haven't tested that yet.Two sticks of DDR4 (verified with memtest). If dual-channel even applies to DDR4, it should be running.Builds a complete Linux kernel in about seven minutes on the SSD using schedtool -B -e make -j 5.I bought this in part to play Skyrim, which it does well in 1080 on High settings, possibly even Ultra, with the following notes: 1. The cooling is inadequate for gaming. The SSD actually pulled an overheat event. I solved this with one of those cooling pads that blows on the bottom of the laptop.2. Install Skyrim on the SSD. Makes a huge difference. I tried using the SSD as Win10 Readyboost and it made no difference.3. This is not sold as a gaming laptop, but for the price it does a pretty good job if adequately cooled."," Defective keyboard: keybounce got progressively worse, and it also started missing characters I had typed so much I couldn't ascribe it to an unfamiliar keyboard. Got replacement, which is about the same. Screen is mediocre, can't really do black but sort of very dark grey. Adequate for coffeeshop use, and for plugging into a  tv or monitor for gaming and movies (tested, works). Get something with a better screen and keyboard if you don't plan on using external tv and keyboard.The two USB 3 ports are too close together to use both at once with two keys, same as the other Acer I had. Fortunately cheap adapter cables are available for the USB-C port.Internal cooling inadequate for gaming.It's a heavy beast, not the best choice for a backpacking trip, but fine for coffeeshop and home use."," This would be a five-star unit with a good screen, four starts with a good keyboard.  Typical Made-in-China: quality control is left to the end-user. Don't hesitate to return China goods, because it might take one or two before you get a good one. If you get one and don't like the bad keyboard, just get something else, because you'll get the same thing if you get a replacement.Linux notes: I installed Mint 18 (KDE edition).With the shipped BIOS (1.05 I think), I could not get the EFI BIOS to recognize the Linux bootloader in ""Insecure boot"" mode, had to put it in ""Secure"" and then set EFI to accept the Grub loader. I've upgraded to the 1.09 bios, same thing.Another reviewer had to remove the SSD to install Ubuntu. It is possible he ran into the problem I ran into, where it *appeared* grub wasn't getting installed, but it actually was and the EFI bios wasn't seeing it without putting it into secure boot mode and manually adding it. I did not have to remove drives. Of course I originally installed to the HDD instead of the SDD which could explain this.I moved /home to an encrypted lv on a bcache device using about 70GB of the SSD as a writearound cache of the underlying LVM vg on the HDD. It is if anything faster than running straight from the SSD, and the writes bypass the SSD and go straight to the HDD, minimizing erase cycles on the SDD.",0,2

You can prop it up when youre watching something or just live with it. Wouldve liked to see them on the top but whhhhhatever.It was a real hastle to install Linux on. Main issues being UEFI junk and issues with the dual GPU. the UEFI part youll have with any recent laptop, Thanks Windows. I had to add custom boot entries with UEFI shell when installing Arch Linux.  Also, for now, the amdgpu drivers are wonky. Lots of wierd kernel errors with 4.4 kernel, having to use the bleeding edge 4.8 kernel for now until thats fixed. Also, had some issues with the HDD going to sleep too often, due to power saving set too agressively. Can be fixed with ``sudo hdparm -B 128 -S 60 /dev/sda `` so, if youre a Linux beginner I probably wouldnt recommend it for that, for now at least. but if you know your way around, it can be done!Windows 10 isn't that bad, just watch out.

I spent a lot of time looking at various laptops in this price range and for my purposes, so far, this one is working out nicely. I nuked the pre-installed windows10 OS immediately and replaced it with Ubuntu 16.04. It is for this reason the lack of touch screen isn't really an issue for me. Note - if you plan on doing this and you're not a linux guru (which I'm not) - you're going to want to remove the 1TB drive before trying to install Ubuntu. For some reason the installer doesn't know where to put the bootloader and the install will fail if you try with both drives in. What I did was remove the 1TB drive, install Ubuntu, then put the drive back in. As I'm on the laptop a lot coding, the feel and layout of the keys is something I'm very particular about. This laptop has, to me, an adequate feel. That is, it won't feel as good as a good mechanical keyboard or even what' s on the Toshiba Flipbooks, but it also doesn't feel like garbage. The keys don't feel mushy, and the entire keyboard doesn't bend when you hit a single key. Also, unlike the entire Lenovo line, the right shift key is where it's supposed to be so long hours coding doesn't become a frustrating nightmare when, every time you need to type something like if (foo != null) { yadda yadda... the cursor moves up a line instead of allowing you to type the '!' character. The display isn't bad. Again, I'm not gaming on this thing, nor am I doing photo editing, so to me, it's perfectly fine. Also, my expectation for this price point wasn't a display that would blow my mind. All in all this laptop, with a few tweaks, could've been amazing.  For my purposes it gets the job done.",10,11

So disappointing.  1920x1080 is great to have, but to hit this price point, Acer has chosen a screen worse than I've seen in a while.  Off angle viewing is non-existent, and on-angle viewing isn't much better.

The original laptop came with Professional and the product key for Pro is still attached - but there's a new product key for Home Premium for Refurbished computers. Haven't tried the Pro key to see if it's been disabled/blacklisted - but in any case this DOESN'T come with a valid license for Pro.Second, Windows wasn't activated.

Though these kind of things don't really bother me. The screen also doesn't have a great viewing angle, but hey, the screen is on a hinge so it's not exactly hard to just adjust it when needed.

The hardware is great, it runs extremely fast and quiet, and the touchscreen is superb.For a first time Windows 8 user, I highly suggest watching a Windows 8 tutorial on YouTube and googling for some tips and tricks.  It will save you a bunch of growing pains.I really like the full size number pad being built into the keyboard.  Screen brightness and sound are easily adjusted with the F keys as are many other great features.My only dislikes thus far are the touchpad and the right shift key.  The touchpad is not centered for whatever reason and can be tricky to get used to (left hand may accidentally touch the pad while typing.  Also, the right shift key is half-size.  As someone who always hits shift with their right pinky, I find myself (even as I type this review) constantly hitting forward-slash instead of shift.  I'm sure that you can get used to that fairly quickly though.Overall, this is another excellent Lenovo product.  If you're waffling on what to get, buy this.  I use it for home and occasionally business use and it has far exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend getting this model over a model without a touchscreen.

Before you suggest the battery died coincidentally - it was plugged in when it died both times.  Tried other sockets on different breakers, blah blah blah.

Newegg had stellar customer service regarding the return.Overall thoughts: I got this despite there being practically no reviews after searching google for about 30 minutes.

Arrived in great condition, clean and without dings, scratches, or any other visible defects.No bloatware except for a few, easily removed pre-installed Lenovo and Intel programs. Comes with Windows 7 Pro, and up-to-date with Windows updates.Runs well, once everything loads completely from a cold boot."," Most noticeable is boot time. Fresh, out-of-the-packaging boot took about 4 minutes.Then, when I ran Windows Update right away, I seem to have caused a minor, optical drive issue, unless it was there to begin with and I didn't notice it in my haste to get the laptop up and running. It isn't fully ""integrated"" into Windows, so to speak; rather, it now always appears in the notification tray under the ""Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media"" icon (green circle, white checkmark) like any other devices you plug into a USB port. It's more an annoyance than a problem, so I'll get around to troubleshooting it fully when I've got more time.Back to the slow boot time. Googling revealed that there have been a number of other users who have experienced the same or similar problem (in years past, at least) with this model of Thinkpad. In the intervening days, I seem to have managed to get the time down to 2-3 minutes by un-installing a few of the unessential Lenovo and Intel programs that came with the unit as well as by a couple of other minor tweaks.(irritatingly, programs also uninstalled very slowly).

This looked like a good deal, particularly with the excellent reviews on here and on the seller's page.However, I'm disappointed with my purchase, mainly for the technical issues I described above. It could very well be the luck of the draw and I ended up with a unit that has these minor issues, or maybe it's just old, which this model is.

The 1TB drive is certainly a plus and the AMD graphics is excellent.

9SIA9JJ4R49848,34-265-266,9/22/2016 7:28:56 PM,Anonymous,"Excellent value, but a few tweaks would make it better",4," I bought this laptop for my college age daughter for school and light gaming. I chose an AMD Carrizo because I feel that in the less expensive price brackets an AMD based machine will game better than an Intel based machine. If you double the price of this machine the situation would be reversed because you could get an i7 with discrete graphics.List of pros:- Modern, decently fast quad core processor. Feels very snappy for any typical application.- Very decent integrated graphics. Plays light games and older hardcore games great. For example, it plays Witcher 2 on high detail; it plays Dragon Age Origins on max; it will do the 2016 Master of Orion on high detail. If you're an RPG player it does just about anything you'll need, such as Divinity Original Sin on high detail. On the other hand, if you play AAA shooters and need 60 fps, you probably need to save up more money for a laptop.- Great keyboard. Not backlit, but really nice feel, good key spacing, and a number pad- Decent screen. 1366 TN, which the first instinct says would suck, but actually has really color accuracy and surprisingly good horizontal viewing angles"," - Single channel memory. As you know if you're tech savvy, putting dual channel memory on a Carrizo increases the gaming performance a lot.- High latency memory. The stock memory is CL11, which higher latency than typical. This decreases the gaming performance about 15% over CL9 based on my testing.- Lousy wireless card. It comes with a Realtek wireless card that has pretty short range and has issues with power saving mode"," So in response to the cons above, I made 3 immediate upgrades to this laptop:- I put in lower latency memory. Though it sounds silly to immediately do that, I bought CL9 memory and sold the CL11, for a price difference of not very much- I put in a better wireless card. I went with an Intel 7265, which is very inexpensive but worlds better than the one that came with this- I swapped the hard drive for an SSD. This is of course not a cheap upgrade, but pretty much requiredAlso, a few technical notes. This is in response to the other review that said it would be a better laptop if it was higher than 1.8 Ghz as well as some observations of testing...This laptop has a base clock of 1.8 Ghz, but it has a max boost clock of 3.2 Ghz. It's set to a 15 Watt TDP, with a 25 Watt burst mode that's limited to 200 seconds. The sustained boost clock is 2.6 Ghz, and it has enough cooling to maintain that clock for extended periods of time.So in short, the real clock rate of this laptop under extended load is 2.6 Ghz. I have run CPU-Z under a variety of loads, and it will do the burst thing for a couple of minutes then it will settle long term at 2.6 Ghz on all 4 cores and stay there. The GPU has an extended load clock rate of around 800 Mhz. Like the CPU, under no load it clocks way down to save battery, does a short term burst, then settles at around 800 Mhz and stays there. Because of the sustained clock rates, this is a great laptop as far as extended gaming, assuming the game is within its capabilities.$.02",5,6

For the price (on sale under $3XX), it's a pretty good deal.  HD and RAM slot is easy to access. Empty RAM slot means you can max out the RAM at 12G instead of 8G.

My low end HP laptop stop booting and had a CPU error code (determined by flashing lights). Since it was out of warranty I figured it would cost more to fix than buying a replacement. I came across this refurbished laptop and the price was excellent. The touchscreen works well. I also like that it has a 10 key pad. The power cord is a nice change from my previous laptops as well. I like the form factor and not having a heavy brick. It plugs into a powerstrip without blocking the adjacent outlets., I'm not real fond of the keyboard layout. I don't care for the spaces between each of the keys.," Before buying I read the reviews and am not sure why some users thought it had bluetooth. Maybe the description changed by the time I bought it. I did see the complaint about Windows updates not working. When I first tried to manually install all the important Windows updates, it failed after running a very long time to download, apply, then back out the updates. I was disappointed but found what worked for me was to simply allow Windows to apply updates at shutdown. It did not apply all the updates, but each time I shutdown and allowed updates to be applied, it worked. I beleive all the important updates were applied in 3 reboots. Then I manually applied the optional updates. Lastly I updated from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1. A little time consuming but I just let it churn away while I used my desktop.If you're looking for a heavy duty gaming laptop, this is not it.

The keyboard was shipped USPS Priority 2-Day.  I exchanged emails with Plan-IT-ROI customer service Wednesday morning, she said it would go out that day, and I received it on Friday.3. The keyboard is ""brand new"".  It was manufactured in 2012, but looks unused: there's absolutely no keyboard ""lint"" trapped between the keyboard and the clear plastic backing and the ribbon cable doesn't have the usual practical creases in it (just the theoretical-but-not-quite-right factory creases)."," I sent Plan-IT-ROI 4 emails over the course of 5 business days (7 calendar days) before they replied to me, specifically to my 4th email.

(I isolated the problem to the keyboard by swapping it with one of the previously purchased laptops.  Also early on 9/2 I purchase a used keyboard from the popular auction website as it was only fifteen dollars, including shipping, and it'll cost that much or more if Plan-IT-ROI insists I pay for return shipping the laptop to them for repair, which I'll decline.)9/3, late: After two full business days without a response, I send the same email a 2nd time.9/5: I write my previous review (and receive my used keyboard from the popular auction website).9/6, early: I send the same email (3rd time) to Plan-IT-ROI customer service after not generating so much as an automated acknowledgment from any previous email.9/8, early: I send the same email yet again (4th time).9/8: Newegg publishes my review.9/9, early: Plan-IT-ROI replies to my 4th-and-latest email asking if I wanted a replacement keyboard (which I hinted at in my email) or a replacement laptop.  I reply saying I want a replacement keyboard and provide my address.  She responds back saying a repacement keyboard will be sent out that day.9/11: I receive the replacement keyboard by USPS Priority 2-Day and successfully test it on the laptop.So what happened to my 1st 3 emails to Plan-IT-ROI?  All emails were exactly the same, sent from the same email address/account, to the same email address, the only difference being the day they were sent.

When I first turned my computer on, the battery was NOT recognized, and I was concerned that the battery may have been dead. Here is how I fixed it for anyone with a similar issue. First boot up Windows completely. Second, with the computer on AC power (plugged in), remove the battery from the computer. Third look at the power management/battery icon in the notification area (system tray) and wait for it to show no battery connected. Finally, put the battery back in and Windows should recognize the battery and begin charging. After fully charged, Windows 7 is showing 7-9 hours battery life remaining on my computer.

It claimed to be charged fully to 100% but after disconnecting the powercable, the computer went to sleep within a minute or two due to low battery!  Also, I noticed that when the screen was dim a while, when it bumped back up to full brightness, there was a distinct flashing connected with high contrast areas (ie areas where white was against a dark background).

Nice machine with no scratches, cracks, or dents.  It seems fairly fast, though I haven't pushed it too hard yet.  I am happy it has Windows 7 operating system.  Not ready to put deal with Win8.  The keyboard has a good feel to it, though it was a little dirty.  The mouse seems to be responsive, but not squirrelly."," I was very disappointed that the battery was DOA.  It would not take a charge. “0% available (plugged in, not charging)"" is what the battery monitor reported.  The good news is, I emailed the refurbisher, U.S. Micro Corporation, and got an immediate response. (support@usmicrocorp.com).  A rep named Richard Herman responded, ""Sorry, Tom, we will have the battery sent out.""  I got the battery within 2 business days!"," U.S. Micro Corp was quick to respond to my DOA battery issue.  Although inconvenienced, I was very pleased to get help so quickly.",1,1
9SIA0AJ38D8404,34-257-730,12/17/2013 3:30:20 PM,JONATHAN B.,Nice notebook...,5," Robust design, fast i5 M250 CPU, sufficient RAM (Samsung), fast 7200 RPM Western Digital HDD. Excellent display, WINDOWS 7, everything worked out of the box - WI-FI etc. Comes with Windows DVDs (32 and 64 bit). A bargain for the price. NO bloatware installed.", Keyboard a little grubby but I cleaned it with Q-Tipl. It was certainly cleaner than the ones at work. Very slight scratches on the lid - to be expected with a refurb product. I don't think a 'normal' person would notice this., An awesome notebook for the price. You can get the specs at HP but this is a seriously durable notebook. We paid well over $1k for these at work about a year ago. US Micro is the refurb-er - if that's a word. They did a nice job.,4,4
9SIA0AJ3SB4757,34-260-029,1/20/2017 5:14:18 PM,Dennis R.,Pretty Hard To Beat - Not Any Longer-See update,3," Bought this on a Shell Schocker for just under $300 with free shipping and it's really hard to beat for the price. Usage is websurfing, email, MS Office, YouTube and other non-resource intensive tasks. No, don't try to play your games, edit video or run Photoshop on this machine.It's very lightweight, runs quite cool, and came with an optical drive which many budget laptops now omit since opticals are considered legacy devices. And you have your choice of three operating systems: Windows 7 PRO is installed and an HP Windows 8 upgrade DVD is included. Then you can migrate to Windows 10 immdiiately using Microsoft's downloadable Media Creation Tool.And last, the hard drive and RAM are easily accessible for upgrades on the bottom by removing one screw. Many budget laptops are now making upgrades much more difficult by requiring major disassembly to access components (like removing the top cover and/or keyboard). The 4 gigs of RAM are on one module, so upgrading to 8 gigs requires only purchasing one additional module rather than having to replace two 2-gig modules with two 4-gig modules. It doesn't get much better than this."," The only con I can find after a month's usage relates to the touchpad, and it's not enough to drop an egg. This Synaptics pad uses two-finger scrolling (ala Mac) rather than the side and bottom bars on the touchpads of many laptops. If you don't keep your two fingers perfectly vertical the the scrolling manuver instead changes the zoom setting in your browser, requiring a trip to Settings > View to restore Zoom back to 100%. A minor annoyance that just takes a little finger adjustment.I wish it had a lighted keyboard but it's a feature that is almost impossible to find at this price point.Update: it is now 14 months later and this laptop's screen is defective.  It has a black line almost all the way across horizontally about one inch from the top.  This laptop has never been abused: no drops, no spills, nothing to cause the screen damage.  As a matter of fact this laptop has never left the house.  I will order a replacement screen and do the job myself but this can't be anything but poor quality on HP's part.  Rating reduced from 5 stars to 3 stars."," How to make this laptop faster: download and run the free PC Decrapifier to remove all the HP and other bloatware. Run msconfig and turn off unnecessary startup programs.Finally, spend around seventy to eighty bucks for the 256 GB SSD of your choice and put the removed 500 GB spinning drive in an external enclosure for backups.As an aside,  I would submit that for most users the speed increase from the SSD will negate the need to add an additional 4 GB of RAM.",None,None

I am a tech for an IT company and when I received the laptop, I opened the screen and noticed that the 2 hinges that attached the screen to the body of the laptop were prone to causing excessive screen flexing if any pressure was put on the back of the screen. I work in all sorts of closets and mech rooms always balancing the laptop on my lap and as it slides around, I grab the screen and pull it back to the center of my lap. When I grabbed the screen only the whole screen flexed and bowed in my hands as it is very thin and if I was not very careful, I could tell it would easily crack the screen. The laptop is very thin and the reason is that the screen is very thin with no strength to it at all. While it might work well for others, it would not work for me at all in the field.

I own somewhere between half a dozen and a dozen machines. I keep one Windows partition around only because I haven't upgraded my glucose meter to a modern one with Linux software for data dumping. I keep that on whatever computer I'm using as my ""travel"" computer. This was to be my new ""travel"" computer but HP used ALL 4 primary partitions. This left me with the following options:1) wipe the drive to install Mint 172) Nuke the recovery and HP tools partitions to install Linux3) Use Virtualbox VMI was pressed for time so I chose option 3.

Got everything I wanted:----8GB of RAM----New Broadwell CPU and it's i5!----New wifi spec: 802.11ac--Fast bootup, like about 5 seconds even with the slow HDD--more on this below in Cons.--Love the button on the left side that boots you straight into the BIOS. No more figuring out which Fn button to hit. Very innovative.--Super easy to swap ANY component--only takes 3 screws. My last laptop took about 20 screws, and 1 screw would say warranty voided if unscrewed. Not here.--Love how Lenovo swaps the function key functionality. Meaning, you can just press the top row function keys to do media functions, without having to hit the Fn button first, and then the function key. Very smart.--Bigger than I thought it would be."," Would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that it has a ton of bloatware, and I couldn't uninstall some it, even with PC Decrapifier, which is insane! And then it would say it was uninstalled, but then when you went back into installed programs, it would still be there, and you could still launch the program! It would take forever to FULLY boot up. Meaning, it takes about 5 seconds to get to the desktop, but then another 10 minutes of background program loading because of the bloatware. The bloatware I think was also the reason why it took forever to shut down the laptop, and each time after literally waiting for about 5 minutes of it saying SHUTTING DOWN, I gave up and just manually held down the power button to shut it down. I ended up swapping the HDD for an SSD and reinstalling windows 8 with a license that I had. Now, this thing is amazing. Would totally buy it again. Lightning quick."," I didn't need a gaming laptop. Therefore, for productivity and web surfing at $530, this thing is a steal. I've seen similar specs closer to $1000. Granted, those $1000 laptops are lighter, but whatever. This thing is thin, and light enough, though it is kind of heavy. The non-1080p screen resolution isn't noticeable, which I thought would have annoyed me. However, if you don't have any tech knowledge and a windows license/disk and an SSD, then stay away.

It's been RMA'd 6 times over the course of ownership. The first time was immediately after opening the box (keyboard was unresponsive). Asus refused to replace the unit with another, instead opting for repairs at their service center in California. Apparently we were naive to think that we would send it off once, it would come back good as new, and I could go on with my life with this nearly $1000 investment. When we got it back, that's when things got really bad. It came back with all sorts of new damages, like screen watermarking, dents in the metal frame, damaged rubber feet (I presume because those have to come off in order to get to the inside). So we call ASUS tech support, still optimistic that this can be resolved. The first time, we had to pay for shipping to get it to the facility. The second time, the rep on the phone said that was odd, and he gave us a shipping label to use. Once it came back for the second time, that is when the screen had been watermarked (the backlighting of the screen leaking through and causing discoloration due to pressure). I was pretty livid by this point, but gave up for a while, as I didn't have the ability to keep holding/talking on the phone with them several times a week.Fast forward a few months, the unit had just been out of warranty for a few months this time. The hinge connecting the screen to the main body becomes broken. The computer is now unusable. We call Asus, and they tell us some good news: there was a recall on that hinge on this model, and they would do a free out of warranty repair. We send it in, (we pay shipping this time), the unit arrives at the repair facility and a couple of days later, we receive a quote for the damage. We call and say that we were told that this had been recalled and Asus was offering out of warranty repairs. They told me that they would look into it and call me back. They did not call me back. Before I was able to take any further action, they repair center sent back the unrepaired unit due to the invoice not being paid.We then get to call the tech support again, and are issued a new RMA WITH a shipping label before the unit has even arrived back with us, so we immediately put it back in the mail once it arrives. They fixed the hinge, they don't charge us for the hinge, but the screen is even more damaged, and there is more damage to the frame. The current RMA that the laptop is in for is regarding the damage caused by the RMA to fix the hinge, it was damaged both on the trip where they invoiced us and sent it back, and the time they fixed it. I took many detailed pictures of the damage, since it was required to make a claim with Asus saying that it was damaged in repair. I don't think Newegg would appreciate me posting a link in the review for security reasons. Feel free to contact me if you want to see the pictures."," I blame the seller in part here, Adorama Camera, because I think they may have passed a refurbished unit off as brand new and sold it to us. We initially tried to call them for replacement of the faulty unit, they told us they wouldn't do anything and that we needed to take it up with ASUS. (Bad review for Adorama here as well). But unfortunately, this bad attention had to turn to ASUS since they had the ability any time over the past two years to fix this by replacing what was clearly a faulty unit under warranty.If you get an ASUS product that works and never has any problems, then you are getting a great product.If you get something that does not work and has to be repaired/replaced, you are better off burning your cash than spending it on an ASUS product. It's a gamble.I would not recommend their products, I would actually advise strongly against it. Their customer service is largely reprehensible, although I ran into a couple of good reps on the phone that unfortunately weren't able to do anything.

The keyboard is also another good quality since typing is to easy to do with all the maneuvers with all the buttons being used at various points in time.  I was a fan of ASUS up until the right hinge broke from my laptop.," I got the ASUS Zenbook UX303LA back in 09/2015 and the hinge stopped working in 12/2015, with the warranty expired as it was purchased through a previous owner. Now it is March of 2016, and I've only used this laptop for about 6 or 7 months and currently facing this dilemma and seeing if I can get this laptop fixed for good. The right hinge was the one that started it all and I was very angry and disappointed when this occurred to me. I know for a fact that the hinge for the UX303LA model has a faulty design which I'm upset a lot about. Given that I took really good care of this laptop really disappoints me and for this issue to happen is unacceptable. Also, the warranty is expired and it frustrates me that ASUS cannot solve the hinge problem, but was hoping to receive help elsewhere. I think it's absolutely ridiculous that ASUS charges over $500 to fix the broken hinge when it is their responsibility to fix the faulty design of the zenbooks.  The usage has been very delicate and after reading online, most other people's hinge broke within the warranty period. I understand that it's not in warranty, but this is an obvious design flaw and poorly manufactured component of the Zenbook which shouldn't happen at all, but being that it did, it's absolutely ludicrous for this to occur. ASUS has failed to take responsibility for a manufacturing flaw with the product as a simple google search that discusses the same dilemmas for this particular model and brand. ASUS stresses the importance of innovation and quality, but after the right hinge broke as well as ASUS refusing to take responsibility, it has come to the point I wouldn't bother buying anything from ASUS ever again. Based on my google search, there have been numerous people who have experienced the same problems and were able to get their laptops fixed with no charge from Asus representatives from this very site.  I hope all goes well after people read this review I have written today."," The only thing that should definitely change about the Zenbook and this particular model is that the hinges should be redesigned into something more stronger, durable and long-lasting. The hinges are too delicate to break and the plastic cover of the hinges should be replaced with a stronger material and is something that ASUS manufactures should REALLY consider doing at this point. Given that this product has a faulty design and poor support services, I would not recommend purchasing any kind of ASUS product! Instead, save yourself the trouble and get a better quality and luxurious laptop such as Apple, Dell, Lenovo, etc.",1,1

Sure enough, if I tried to close the laptop lid, there was a cracking noise and the bevel separated further from the screen and base. When I closed the lid, the entire hinge snapped (think plastic flying everywhere) and the entire screen is off kilter from the base.

SSD boots around 7 seconds from shut down which is typical. I didn't get this computer to be a powerhouse of a machine; it is to be used for portability, and convenience, which it has done extremely well so far. I am getting around 6-7 hours of battery life, not running anything too intensive on it.Overall, for the time being, I am very please with this machine."," The power button is located in the top right hand corner, where you would usually be used to the Delete key located. I have yet to fat finger it, but it is a concern of mine. Came with a little more bloatware than I would have preferred, but it is easily removed. My only real complaint: when I put the computer to sleep, and then wake it back up, occasionally my entire UI is extremely small. I have yet to figure out why it is doing this. The taskbar shrinks along with the scaling sizes of everything on the screen. If I then press restart, it quickly reboots and everything is back to normal."," For the few days I have had it, I am very pleased. Very elegant, lightweight, and quite fast.

N82E16834300981,34-300-981,2/10/2015 6:57:55 AM,Andre J.,Highly recommended at $310,5," The biggest PRO about this laptop is the SSD.  Sure, it's a first gen Samsung SSD (SATA-2), but that's still faster than any conventional HDD that you're going to get in any new or refurb laptop.  In fact, given failure rates of HDDs in laptops, I would NOT want a refurb laptop with an original HDD.  If it hasn't failed by now, it'll certainly be slower than when it was new since it'll start allocating reserve sectors to make up for failing ones.I'd still trust the longevity/MTBF of a first gen Samsung SSD over any mfg HDD.And for a basic laptop, 128GB of space is plenty for most people.The system ships with a pretty clean install of Win 7 Pro x64.  No Home version nor 32-bit crippling the OS.  I was also pleased that the system shipped with the latest BIOS (A21) and there wasn't any bloatware on the system.Speaking of the BIOS, it has better-than-average customizations available.The battery functions as good as a new battery.  It certainly doesn't hurt that the laptop has an SSD which contributes to extended battery life compared to running a conventional HDD.Looks like they went out of their way to clean or replace the heatsink and cooling fan.  Bonus points there!14"" screen = less screen to illuminate = longer battery life & smaller overall footprint.To get this machine up & running took very little time.  Throw a free MS-Office-compatible suite on there like LibreOffice or OpenOffice, and you're good to go!"," Nothing significant, but I guess this is where I'll nitpick.  I have to keep in mind this is a refurb, so wear & tear is expected.There is a small cosmetic strip/line of rubber that is kind of embedded around the screen bezel.  A small section of this had come loose.  I just pushed it back in, but it didn't want to stay tight.  A couple of the phillips screws to remove the back plate were mildly rounded out.  I was still able to remove them, I just had to be careful.While the heatsink & fan were very clean, there was some minor accumulation of dirt/organic debris in some of the crevices elsewhere in the laptop.  It was nothing that compressed air (from a compressor, not a can) didn't take care of.Again, these things are nitpicking on a system with expected wear & tear.  If I'm complaining, it's because it's not ""like new"" inside and out.  And that's not fair of me.  :-)So really, there's no CONS about this system."," The memory it arrived with was a 2x2GB config of DDR3 PC10800 CL9.  The system will take PC3-12800.  I put an 8GB Crucial stick (N82E16820148734) in there and it accepted it without complaint*.  Brings the total up to 10GB of RAM.  Or run the 8GB by itself at faster clock speeds, but in single-channel mode.*CPU-Z reported the memory as 8GB, but the timings were a bit weird.  It's not worth detailing here since it didn't negatively impact system performance.I could've bought a matching 8GB PC3-10800 SODIMM for the same price, but since the PC3-12800 was the same price, I figured I'd get it and put it into a newer laptop down the line if it wasn't compatible with this system.  Note, the Crucial stick I bought was low voltage (1.35 -vs- 1.5v) and lower latency (CL9 -vs- CL11), which should match up better with the existing RAM.In short, 8GB or 10GB is going to be better than 4GB, period.  However, running one 8GB PC3-12800 in single channel versus 10GB PC3-10800 (8+2) in dual-channel is going to be unnoticeable in daily use.  You'll only see differences in benchmarks.  So go with what feels best to you. Or whatever is cheapest at the time.",11,12

Boot time in win 7 pro of just over 3 seconds from turn on to desk top."," The listing did not state if the webcam was included or had been removed on the referb. I took a chance on this one because the 6420 always comes with a webcam,but no dice on this one. Pet peeve, none of the dell drivers were installed and had boot issues because of outdated BIOS but once those were installed and updated it works great."," Three out of four rubber feet are missing, but that doesn't bother me.

As many others have reported it also occasionally ""flashes"" on the desktop, appears to be Windows explorer crashing over and over again. Sometimes this flashing is so bad that you can't perform any actions at all, requiring a hard shutdown to stop it.

I know, specs are not everything when considering a computer, but so far, this laptop has exceeded my expectations.  I read several reviews where it did not come with a backlit keyboard (which was kind of a deal breaker for me).  I just bought this black Friday week from newegg, and I can confirm it DOES HAVE A BACKLIT KEYBOARD, yay!  The pictures displayed on the Newegg site show the spacebar without the lighting logo on it, but mine has the logo on it, and a quick FN+Spacebar turns the lights on.  Remember to hold down the FN key while pressing spacebar.  I even called Lenovo to see if they could confirm the backlighting for this specific model, and they confirmed it has it.   I've played a few games on it, and so far so good, even with the slightly less powerful GTX 950m.  Star Wars Battlefront was running around 40 fps on default settings (looked to be set to medium).  if you're a gamer, this is not going to blow you away (you'll want a laptop with a 10 series card); however, I'm not a huge gamer, so this is fine with me.  Knowing I can get a decent experience while playing online with the kids is a bonus.  The sound seems to be OK as well.  It's a laptop, so you can't expect studio quality of course, but for me, they are perfectly adequate.All in all, this was an enormous upgrade for me, going from a single core machine with 4gb of ram and a non HD display.  I believe this was one of, if not the best laptop deasl offered black Friday/cyber Monday.  It's not a flashy machine, with RGB lighting, or a 4k touch display, or a new fancy 10 series GPU, but Lenovo has been making great products for a long time, and I couldn't be happier with the purchase.",3,3

I use this for college and it comes in handy. I was unsure about using chrome OS but I decided to take the plunge (I bought mine used online for $135 so it was a steal). It is linux compatible with a program called crouton. I'm sure there are others out there but this is a pretty popular one. Gives you Ubuntu 12.04 with the option of XFCE or Unity. Now here's the kicker. This is obviously not any sort of desktop replacement or a main laptop replacement. HOWEVER, chrome's remote access app is a game changer in my opinion. You don't have to give up your windows or mac os experience whatsoever. I'm able to remote in to my desktop running windows 7 PREMIUM which by default doesn't have full remote access. However with the chrome app you don't need that feature. As stated above the battery life isn't all that impressive, or even average for a laptop this size. I'm averaging about 4 hours with normal use. That's the only trade off with this chromebook in comparison to other netbooks.   It's nothing to fret over in my opinion. The speed of this laptop is well worth the cost, which is nothing as far as laptops and netbooks go. If you've been on the fence about it, I say go for it. Don't forget to utilize the remote desktop app. You'd be surprised how useful a lot of the chrome apps are.Hope this helps in your decision.",2,2

After showing the simple operating system I fell in love with it. Personally, I am a very techy teen (do not judge my review by my age), and it even met my requirements.

After one day I have found ""cloud"" replacements for all the things I typically do on the computer.  I would sincerely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a secondary computer/ laptop.  The reason I say this is because of its different local storage system.  Google WILL store all of your music (up to 20,000 songs) and store unlimited amount of normal sized pictures in the cloud.  Call me kooky, but I still like having a computer with the pictures and music physically on it.

I have never had this issue from Newegg before, and I've never gotten so little help from Google before... Very disappointed in both.The thing that really grinds my grits is they won't even try to help us because the product is open. I'm sorry, but I'm not telepathic, I can't tell if a product is going to do what it's supposed to do until I plug in the battery and hit the power button. Most any IT will tell you that's when the fun begins, because it's either gonna work, or you're going to have to run for the nearest extinguisher."," It was a pain getting any information on the problem, and some of the help topics drummed up stuff completely irrelevant and out dated to the product itself. When I looked into the product closer, I read from numerous sources that it doesn't even support WPA2 connections and prefers the ever weak WEP. I tried WEP and still couldn't get a solid line to hold. When I expressed that, they said they could test it but that if it connected to one of their routers we'd be billed the stocking fee.

It no longer feels like you have to make major sacrifices on performance to have an inexpensive web browsing system.Perfect for parents or grandparents who just need something to check their email. Rolling updates to the OS ensure they never have to worry about antivirus or exploits. OS Verification ensures you never have to worry about them destroying the system and needing a restore.With ChrUbuntu, this machine gets even better. Nothing you can't do on this. The Celeron is Sandy Bridge based, so you're not exactly settling when it comes to CPU power. (SB Celeron 1.1Ghz is roughly equivalent to a 1.6Ghz Core2Duo) The hardware is very well supported in ChrUbuntu and the only real issue has been some keymappings not carrying over from ChromeOS. (Brightness and volume, for example)Steam for Linux runs well, with some tweaks you can easily get 40-70fps in TF2. More complex maps and maps with higher player limits will cause framerates to drop, obviously. Minecraft gets a very solid 30-40fps. Plays Youtube 720 streams fluidly.

I guess YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS :p", Updated Cons. 1/1/20151. No skype / No regular android apk apps. Chromebook IO to android IO are just like Windows to Win RT / Mac OS to iOS. They are two different system. It's pretty sad but I believe google is fixing this now.," Some issues u may see them from other reviews:1. People said it's a finger print lid. YES IT IS but I don't care. I don't show off people my 200 dollars stuff so whatever it looks like.2. I believe 4G version is clearly better than 2G version. You can see many reviews comparing Acer 720 and Asus C200. C200 is a later one but there are some issues regarding as performance (slower than Acer 720). So, I bought this one. Luckily I got a very good discount which is even cheaper than 2G version :p.3. For personally issue, I need work in a quite environment. This beast is quite.4. I like right side power in. This power in is on left. Just FYI.5. I am a heavy keyboard user. I don't how poor Acer 720 keyboard is but this keyboard is good to type and NO SWITCHING ISSUE from pc user. EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT A TOUCH SCREEN, THE KEY BOARD AND TOUCH PAD STILL ROCK SUPER WELL.6. I am an Asus fan and I DO KNOW ASUS HAS THE WIFI ISSUE. They FINALLY FIXED IT ON THIS DEVICE.7. The screen works ok. At least you don't feel it's a cheap stuff. It's not fully HD but IT'S REALLY ACCEPTABLE for personal daily use.8. I have not experienced the 11 hours battery advantage yet but I believe it's cool.Last. I am from Taiwan. Asus is as well. Sorry for the grammar issue.",2,2

My goal for this product was for it to be light weight, small but not cramped, and have a long battery life. This product hit all those perfectly.Asus makes good quality products for a reasonable price and you can feel the quality here. Even though this is a cheap and light machine it feels well built. When first setting it up one may remember setting up windows... where you have dozens of questions (especially if you don't use recommended settings). However with the chromebook all you do is connect to the internet (which isn't even required) and login to your google account. I was up and running in less than a minute.", -RamThe only con here is the memory the haswell celeron with 2.16 GHz is great! However when opening multiple tabs you notice a slight slowdown which is most likely attributed to having just 2 GB of ram. But you can hardly notice.Most machines running 2GB of ram would just be horrendous but with Chrome OS you do not need the spec's of other Operating systems., Not meant for heavy workloads. But great for quick tasks and internet use. I use it for class so that I can type notes and at home when browsing the web. Does not replace my Lenovo Z400 but does do a good job of making it so I do not need to turn it on very often.,3,3

It only takes about 1.5 hours to charge from a dead battery.At 2.5lbs it's lightweight, no fan, no noise and great for general ChromeOS tasks. I personally purchased this for the low price and long battery life. Due to it's light weight I take it to work daily use it in meetings and even coding as there are some great web based apps and services like codepen that make traditional applications unnecessary.As a web designer I spend 100% of my day on the web so A Chromebook is a perfect companion.It handles HD video on YouTube and Google Movies without any stutter or buffering.", Javascript intensive sites tend to strain the CPU a little upon page load.

I'm running multiple tabs and listening to music via Google Play and I've seen no lagging, stuttering, or pausing. Battery life appears to be excellent -- my Chromebook has been up and working for a little over  hours and the battery shows 76 percent left, or another 8 hours and change. I wasn't expecting such snappy performance, or such an elegant build for the price. Well done ASUS!"," None really. It can't scramble eggs or run Photoshop, but that's because it's a Chromebook. I knew what I was getting -- or hoping to get -- and this little machine is spot-on."," If a Chromebook is what you want (what you really really want), then this is an excellent Chromebook to own. If you don't know how Chromebooks differ from Windows machines or Macs, do some research before you buy. But if it's a Chromebook you want, this is a good choice!",10,11
9SIA6V655P7754,34-298-773,12/21/2016 6:42:06 AM,Anonymous,"Horrible Laptop, crashes, freezes, and very slow.",1, -4k monitor resolution," -Very Slow-To little of RAM -graphics card not good enough to handle 4k resolution-Crashes, and restarts a lot, escpecially when running any adobe suite products"," If this had more ram and a bigger SSD it MIGHT be a little better, not worth the time or money to find out tho.",1,6
9SIA6V655P7754,34-298-773,11/3/2016 10:16:35 PM,RICHARD H.,After a Year of use: Extremely pleased.,5," - You are not going to find many 4K touchscreens in this price range, especially with such a powerful CPU and Graphics.- You have the i530 Workstation Graphics for maximum battery and the powerful nVidia 960M Gaming Graphics in a single system.  The nVidia control panel takes care of dynamically switching it, I don't have to do anything.- All ports are USB 3.0 not just some of them.- Very thin and light.  While it is still a 15.6 inch system that won't fit in most book bags, it is very thin and lightweight.- Extremely Long battery life when surfing the net or doing normal tasks.  Even when your gaming it is still really good for a gaming system.- Easy access to upgrade components or clean out dust.  With just a single screw remove the bottom plate giving you access to battery, 2.5 inch hard drive bay, M.2 SSD port, 2 memory slots (one is empty with 8GB version), Wireless card, and system fans, and heat sinks.  - Amazing cooling solution and design."," - The Bass speaker is overpowered and pops unless you turn it down in advanced audio controls.  Most systems in this price range have no bass speaker, so...- The touchpad is a TRACKPAD, as such there are no buttons, and the whole pad is the button.  - The Hybrid drive is not an SSD.  You are getting a Hybrid 1 TB Hard Drive with a 8GB SS cache.  I would suggest buying a M.2 SSD immediately, or just buying this with the SSD option.  - All ports are USB 3.0 making installing windows 7 difficult for the technically gifted, and impossible for the average user.  This is a good thing if you plan to just run windows 10."," - This is a trackpad, You click by pressing down with one finger anywhere on the pad.  A right click is detected by clicking the lower right corner or a 2 finger click anywhere.  The ""button area"" is just part of touchpad and this gives you huge touch area.  If you are a MAC user you will actually love the trackpad because it works just like a MAC, but if your a PC user like me it takes some time to get used to, after a year I now prefer it.- I added an SSD in the empty M.2 port, and currently have a dual boot.  Windows 10 takes 45 seconds to load on the Hard Drive.  It takes 5 seconds (not kidding you) on the SSD.  And this kind of performance difference is true for loading every program.  The benefits of SSD far outweigh the smaller drive that most people won't use. If you need space you can have a huge SATA Hard Drive for data, and the M.2 SSD for the OS, to get the best of both by having both. - When this system first came out it had driver issues.  Both the HD 530 from intel and the nVidia 960M were new, and had driver issues that made the system nearly unusable.  Every manufacture not just Dell had issues with these two.  The touchpad issues caused by lack of driver couldn't be understated.  Initially use of this machine was plagued by random movement of the cursor while typing, crashes in games and 3d applications, etc... and then Intel updated it driver, nVidea updated its driver, and Microsoft fixed the mouse driver.  These 3 major driver issues were resolved in march 4 months after its release and you should not have the issues experienced by early adopters.  These issues are why all the early ratings are so low, and the recent ratings so high.  Initially I would have given this system a 1 star.  You get to buy an amazing 4.5 star system that is underpriced because the initial problems.- There are 2 heat pipes (water filled hollow tubes that circulate without a pump through capillary and evaporation) that run to 3 radiators.  There are 2 fans that force air though the radiators at either side.  This design is what makes this gaming system so thin.  If you prop up the back the system (just put the power supply under the back bumper) it will cool without fans (unless your in a hardcore game, or its mid summer).  My only complaint here is that they didn't leave enough gap under the system to cool though convection and the fans will come on if you don't prop up the back edge to let the air flow without them.",8,8
9SIA6V655P7754,34-298-773,4/2/2016 12:49:05 PM,John A.,Upgraded from a toshiba T135 S1310,4," Fast hybrid drive, even though spins at 5400rpm--but if 1tb ssd comes down in the $200 range, I'll probably upgradeBought from Best Buy online last week for a few dollars cheaper.Gorgeous display. Rich colorsThere is a battery power indicator light on the front that goes off while plugged in and if the battery is not charging. I thought it was broke at first and so while reading thru the manual, I found out that that's how it's supposed to work. However, I found out a very cool thing--pressing Fn+H will change the light to act as a hard drive activity indicator instead--so very happy about that I can't tell you how much so--I'm addicted to the activity light.touch screen responsiveSince RAM upgradable, I can an add the extra much cheaper later (but haven't felt the need just yet).Although I normally use a Zalman laptop cooler, the 7559 seems really cool. And quiet. The only time I've heard the fans really kick in is when using Dell's Diagnostic test tool.While I am concerned about its durability, the keyboard's  pressure/action feels good. I'm still trying to get used to having an actual number pad. The layout of the keys are also pretty much where I want things. I normally have to remap my home/end keys because the are in such unusable locations...but these make sense to me. I love having a backlit kb but I do wish the had a more options than the 3 toggled preset states.Speakers sound good. The headphones sound night vs day better than in my toshiba--and they are just a cheapie five dollar pair.All the ports feel ""tight""--I had a problem with my usb ports in the toshiba becoming much looser over the six years I've had it. I think these might last a bit longer. Time will tell!The overall build feels solid and durable."," The touchpad is the weakest element of this laptop and is mostly what prevents this from being a 5 star review. It just feels flimsy, and is often non-responsive. The settings for it are also limited (can't set up touch/scoll zones for instance). In the interest of full disclosure, I didn't like the touchpad on my last laptop either, so used a logitech M705 mouse. LOVED it. But I don't want to tie up a usb port, so, I'm looking to invest in a strictly bluetooth mouse. If anyone knows how to replace the stock touchpad with a (better) 3rd party one, I would love to know!While it's not a problem yet, the keyboard looks flimsy--but as of now, it feels okay. I'm just worried about durability. And while it's not a loud kb, it certainly isn't one of the quietest out there... Bad if you are taking notes in class or in a meeting. Weight--it is heavy but then I knew that going in. However, I didn't know the power brick is also a weighty sidekick. But with the right backpack, that shouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately, the Battery/HD activity light defaults to Battery light on startup. I can't force it to stay in HD activity indicator mode when booting up."," Although I thought having a touch screen would be nice, I have to admit that it's a bit of a pain to use in a laptop form factor. I was actually looking at the ASUS ROG 15.6 laptop instead of this one, but the nontouch screen dissuaded me.  If you are still looking, you should compare these two--it might be a better deal if you decide that touch isn't as useful for you in this form factor as you may have thought. I know I could live without it now that I have it. That's not to say I don't want touch--I do, and if I could afford a Surface Pro 4 with these kinds of specs, I would get it in a hard beat for the touch on a tablet experience (would make grading essays much easier and convenient).While the resolution itself is not a con, Dell has a trick to make text bigger even though you're set at the highest resolution (to keep everything from becoming too tiny). In theory this is to make it easier to read things. Unfortunately, not all windows or screens get embiggened with the software (maybe it's a Windows 10 thing). So for instance, and this is a stupid example, but, the MS Word start screen is like 3/4 of an inch on my display. If it were something I actually needed to read, I would have a hard time. For example, I really had a hard time reading the menu that came up when updating the bios of the hybrid drive--the laptop kept rebooting to it until I finally realized it was a menu and not a message--took me a few tries to find the right option to boot successfully back into Windows. But for the most part, Dell's embiggening of everything works pretty well. I suppose, they do it to maintain the higher resolution for graphics and games.I'm not a much of a gamer but did load Civilization 3 on it (I know, I know) and it rocked (it was very slow and on lowest res on the toshiba). I do a lot of video editing, though and am excited to try it out--the toshiba was much too weak to properly run camtasia (well, it would run, but editing took forever bc I couldn't do it ""real time""--slow-mo and stuttered way too much).I am currently looking for  a backpack and sleeve to fit this beast... I used to use a zeroshock in-bag sleeve (awesome btw), but I'm not sure they have one that will fit the 7559.  Not sure about Dell backpacks, but like all of them, it really requires a hands-on test. Overall, for the specs at this price, and the overall quality of the build, I would probably buy this again. I don't know if there's a cheaper nontouch version, but I suspect if they had one, that's the one I would get.If I run into any weird problems or issues as I use it, I'll update this review.",2,2

Comes with several problems.,3, GTX 960m6th gen i7great resolution backlit keyboard heh :)," For starters the wifi adapter at first did not work, and i was not able to connect to the wifi to update my drivers. I had to connect via ethernet to connect to the internet and updated my drivers from there which resolved the issue. although it comes with 1tb of storage which is standard on most laptops, it comes with a toshiba 1tb hd running at 5400 rpsm. In other words you're going to want to upgrade to either a hard hybrid or a ssd which is what i did. I went with the samsung evo 850 500gb. the speakers are loud which is a plus, but there is an extremely obnoxious and extremely obvious static noise that it makes whenever you play something loud. if you play it quietly it sounds great, but once it gets to the level where you're comfortable with the sound the static gets extremely obnoxious as i stated before. I was reading about the battery life and was expecting a bit more out of it. only get about 3hrs tops on very light use such as web browsing. Not sure what's going on but at the same time when i put videos in full screen it gets extremely choppy. not sure what's going on with this. Updated all the drivers, but still have choppy videos. This goes for both firefox and google chrome. Games when i play have to be on fullscreen and not windowed full screen cause if not it'll start stuttering. (i play csgo and sc2) despite that stuttering, when it is on full screen i can play the two games on max settings of course and it'll run beautifully. ", Get good headphonesUpgrade to a SSDHave either a wifi adapter or ethernet cable on hand to connect to the internetdon't get if you use speakers or this might just be me If it didn't have the choppy graphics and horrible speakers.

You have to go into the settings and turn that ""feature"" off.  Next, the keypad/trackpad placement.  The trackpad is off-center from the laptop because this laptop has a number pad on it.  Nice feature at first but the placement of the trackpad makes my palm hit it inadvertently many times.  Even while writing this review, my hand has touched it at least 5 times.  This causes the cursor to move to somewhere else in the field and I end up writing my thoughts in another sentence. Then I have to stop, go back and write again.

Thus, when I gave my prior laptop to a family member and was looking to buy a new one, I went with a brand I knew I liked. However, I could not be more disappointed with my recent purchase. The first one I received, the motherboard completely crashed within my 90 day warranty, thus I had to send it in for a replacement. Newegg was great in being speedy and accommodating with this issue. However, this meant that not only was I put out of having a laptop for a while, but I had to reinstall all of my programs on my replacement.  The replacement I received was even faultier than the first. First, I believe the fan on the laptop is loose, thus it makes a loud (spinning) noise whenever the laptop is powered on.   Second, I’ve never had issues with malaware, as I’ve had with this laptop. I installed anti-malaware software which partially helps, but I have to run it almost every other time that I use the laptop and I still have about one or two popup ads on each page. This laptop is not what was marketed. I was expecting a laptop which was convenient for internet use and student use in general. I basically use it for internet searches, use Microsoft Office, and a statistical software program. However, all of these uses have performance issues, at times running so slow that I’m not even able to move my mouse.",,1,2

9SIA2NT3D88699,34-216-995,9/5/2015 12:11:17 PM,Anonymous,"Avoid, and I Mean It!",1, Nice audio, Everything else," I have owned this PC for several months now, and more and more problems continue to crop up with it.  The first unit I purchased had to be returned because of a defective keyboard.  The replacement has considerable issues with the touchpad, including horribly sticky mouse buttons, but I (unwisely) decided to keep it.  The touchpad continues to have issues - the left mouse button sticks incessantly.  In addition, the touchpad is so sensitive that I have personally witnessed movement and even mouseclicks when my finger was hovered several inches away but was not touching it - and NO, there is NO software correction for this behavior.  In the past month, I have begun experiencing problems with the touchscreen, which suddenly goes haywire and automatically records touches all over the screen when nothing is anywhere near it - you can see the ""touches"" bouncing all over the screen.  I even made a video of the dancing phantom screen touches, which Toshiba has no explanation for.  I have had to disable the touchscreen as a result,  which makes using this PC as a tablet impossible, and this is a tablet-convertible device!  So, I have a fancy convertible laptop that I have to use a mouse with because the touchpad is infuriatingly sticky and a touchscreen-enabled device on which the touchscreen has been disabled because it routinely goes haywire.  And don't tell me to update drivers and the like - all driver updates, Toshiba updates and Windows updates have been installed.  Based on my experience, I would recommend you avoid this model.  I have had nothing but trouble from day one, and this is my second unit.  Quality control does not appear to be a Toshiba priority.  Toshiba support says I should send the unit back for warranty service, but with only one PC what does one do in the interim?  Go to the library and use a public computer for a month???  All in all, I have been made a Toshiba-hater based on my experience with this device.  I will never buy another Toshiba product again - EVER.

The original was returned due to a keyboard defect (dreadfully sticky spacebar).  Alas, the replacement unit has its own issues, which leads me to believe that Toshiba has problems with quality control.  Let's see, the second unit has problems with the left button on the touchpad - it barely presses down and never ""clicks"" (by contrast, the right button works fine).  One key of the backlit keyboard isn't lit, and several of the keys are virtually flush with the keyboard surface, not projecting above it as they should.  Oh, and the base of the unit is either curved or the rubber pads are not balanced, because the laptop will not sit flat on a desk - the front right corner floats off the surface and the unit rocks back and forth as you type.  Just what you want with a fancy laptop, huh?  These issues, spanning two random units, are, in my opinion, indicative of incredibly poor quality controls and make me question whether I will ever purchase another Toshiba product.  Not sure what will happen to the laptop I now have - should I take my chances and return it again or accept my losses and turn my new, expensive 2-in-1 laptop into a desktop unit by adding a wireless keyboard and mouse?

The glossy screen is reflective but clear, just angle it to remove the reflections.  4Gig max may bother some, but typically no one opens that many windows to fill 4G. Note: extra Gigs does not mean faster unless you fill the 4G.  The keyboard is just a tad non-conventional in size but it's fine by me, as the keys are pleanty large enough and have a great feel.  I'm glad the speakers put out pleanty of volume, no need for any auxilary booster speakers on this machine.  I was concerned about speed with a 5400 rpm drive, but it's pleanty acceptable so far.  I upgraded to Win 8.1 for free, and put on Classic Start to make it a real Laptop, starting in the Desktop, bypassing that awful Microsoft Metro Tablet junk.  This is a great Desktop PC, you don't have to use it as a tablet unless your so inclined to like MSN Metro with the touch.

Ordered on a holiday (Monday) and delivered on Tuesday.The machine looks like new. In very good condition. And the OS was new, was installed at first start up, and I activated for the first time. The computer is fast enough. Does everything about the same as a supposedly more powerful machine. Officially it is a 1.8MHZ core 2 duo with 1GB RAM and 60GB HDD. Not much. But it has 3 times the RAM of my old Vaio, and 3 times the hard disk space, for only 10% of the VAIO price. This machine looks like it is a steal! I bought this machine because my 5 year old always wants to use mine, and I need to use mine. So i bought this for her. She can play all her education game CDs and also online games for kids. But the machine is nice enough, even I want to have it for me. I am seriously thinking getting another for me, as some sort of backup for my desktop. The key board feels good. The screen is bright enough when plugged."," The mouse pads needed to be adjusted to improve sensitivity. Not a big deal since it works very well after the adjustments. It is too early for now to find a con. The machine works and works very well, and looks nice and brand new too. The optical drive is a DVD-ROM, not a big deal since I use external drive instead of burning CDs, DVDs. But still a DVD+RW would have been better."," I paid 2 year replacement, which was steep at $60 for a machine priced at $214. But I don't have to worry about buying another machine for my kid for at least another 2 years. It has a CD/DVD drive, and firewire, and a PC card slot. Even a serial port (for joysticks?) at the back. One could also use the serial port for old palm organizers. the overall design, the 'look' or aesthetic of the machine is old. But the machine looks new, so it kind'a comes across as 'retro' and still cool. Not very thin, but not too thick either. Has WinDVD installed, so one can watch a movie right away. No other software. Which is good (no trial software trash, making the machine lean). Came with large battery. The battery indicator says I have 6 hrs 22 minutes on a full charge. Wow! But needs to be tested. Take this feedback with a grain of salt since this is day 1. Hope to get back after 6 months to see how it went. But at least for now, looks like an great machine via an amazing deal.",5,5

Absence of indicator lights on the keyboard.  The battery indicator light is on rear, left side and the SSD light is on the right, front side. Neither light is visible unless you lean way over or tilt the computer (the sides slant inwards just enough to hide these lights), thus you can't tell if the machine is off, sleeping, or if it's plugged in/charging.2. No sleep button. You must either use the power button, on-screen commands, or constantly close/open lid.3.  No hot key for disabling the tracking pad.

When I asked the customer representative what I can do about this (expecting to have to send/take it to a service center, which while not preferable still makes it feasible) the representative told me “we don't allow users to upgrade any notebook parts except RAM and HDD” and essentially told me that they don’t care. When I confronted the service representative about lying about the RAM (Intel directly states a maximum RAM capacity of 32GB and I know someone directly who is currently running 16GB in the same notebook) they gave me an attitude of not caring with “8GB has tested by asus and it is steable and safe”.

It has a very smoothe looking, but small (for a pc) touchscreen (11.6 inches) but still larger than any tablet.Of COURSE its not a powerhouse Crysis 3 pc... but then, who cares. Its a laptop that easily surpasses 3 hours of battery life with hard use and 85% brightness on battery. Hdmi output is 720p, but with an upscaling t.v. you wont notice. (most have this)I use this daily, alongside my phones tethered internet, to be able to do anything (literally) besides high end gfx processing, autocad type work or high end (most new) video games.Its so small and light that anyone can bring it along with them anywhere without being burdened. Of course, 2 gigs of ram and a dual core 1.5 is not blazing fast by any means, but the sleek Asus design and some of the apps like InstantON, really make it worth it.Asus' design on this one is better than the new models. the new ones are all multi toned, with sweat unfriendly palm rests. I am an avid pc user who is on a computer 8 hours for work and minimum of 1-3 more even on leisurely days. Truth be told, for 85% of peoples lifestyles/needs this pc and its specs will perform just fine (provided u dont have 200 browse rwindows and photoshop open at the same time)The touchpad is very nice, but make sure you configure the options for the touchpad to best suit your feel. ( i disabled every option including tap to click, so i could roll my finger around on the pad and keep my left index on the clicker.; realistically, this is an issue with ANY touchpad/win8 friendly touch pad"")The touch capabilities are nice on the side... nothing primary, but always good to have as another means to navigate/play. I use this for Magic 2014, and other low end gfx games... all my work from home, mostly anything... ( besides cd burning)I also have an i7, 6gb, 1gb video Dell Studio that i use at home for any serious gaming/permanently tethered to my T.V. So I do know/have owned a more powerful pc, which makes my opinions more relevant. I use computers all day for like 10 years plus."," Being an ultra/netbook this thing has no disk drive. =D So plan ahead for that. You ""Can not"" upgrade/change the battery or ram yourself, so dont bother trying to open the case."," Ignore the 5 reposted bad reviews by one user ""Bud"" who clearly does not know his feet from his hands, and must not be able to use any computer properly let alone this one.If youre  a heavy pc user (serious gfx, games etc) you may want to go for a model with more ram/processer/video card... but DONOT be surprised if that pc is way below 2 hours worth of battery life when actually being used, and of course being considerably more expensive.ive noticed, people buy laptops like they buy cars. They spend more than they should, for features and speed they dont even have the ability/time/space to use and always want the fanciest look for cheapest.Reality check; You dont need 450 torque to drive to work in the city.Have a nice day",8,9

This was perfect. while some may complain, I for one prefer matte screens over glossy and I'm quite happy with the 1366x768 resolution screen (you can force 1920x1080 though Catalyst Control Center but since the screen isn't meant for that so it's a bit blurry for fine text)The processor is more than powerful enough for most tasks, with 4 cores, and integrated R6 and 8GB of RAM, most things aren't a problem for it, although the laptop will get a little warm even with mild use.Instantly upgraded to Windows 10 and haven't had an issue."," If you're used to using a much higher resolution monitor (2560x1440 for myself) this laptops screen is a bit tricky to get used to, there just isn't a whole lot of desktop real estate, however most webpages show up just fine, so that's never been an issue for me.The biggest con I have however is how difficult it is to trade out that hard drive. The whole laptop has to be taken apart to get at the slow 5400RPM drive if you want to upgrade to, say a SSD, which is perfect for this computer as this isn't something I'd rely on to store everything with, but if you'd want faster boot times from shutdown and a lower power device, a SSD is perfect."," Wish it shipped with Win10 pre-installed and without all the bloatware but i get that this is an older model, just grab the free upgrade while it's available.I also wouldn't pick up up unless you can find it for $450 or less as I did. You can get something much better for $500 and above.",None,None

Ports are nice and sturdy.  Nice deal for a mid-range workhorse if you can find it on sale at around 400 bucks.," Much lighter than laptops of a few generations ago, but it's also somewhat flimsy.  Touchpad is the worst I've ever used to the point that I have to shut it off and use a USB mouse.  The screen is not going to wow you with vibrant glossyness.  The inverter/charger is just obnoxiously designed.Upgrading any of the hardware or replacing the battery on this lappy requires removal of 10 screws on the underside, peeling off the frontplate/keyboard, and carefully detaching/reattaching wires for the mobo, keyboard and USB ports.  Then you still have to get to the hardware you want to swap out.  Probably a job best done by a professional or enthusiast unless you like risk."," Like most off the shelf laptops, this thing came infested with crapware.  I formatted and converted the TB Toshiba HDD to an external and replaced it with a 120 GB SSD for about 60 bucks.

Second unit has no problems so far.A good general purpose laptop. Good for basic work and entertainment.

I am posting this review primarily to warn prospective purchasers about the crumminess of the internal wireless adapter. It only runs at 2.4ghz, which seems unnecessary with the proliferation of 5ghz networks. Moreover, I was having serious download issues (capping at ~4Mbs/sec) so I plugged in a $20 Netgear usb adapter and I can now regularly ~18Mbs/sec).

First time setup for Windows 10 went quicker than I thought it would go.- While not extremely lightweight, it's still light enough to carry around easily.- Manages to stay nice and cool, even with the bit of gaming I was trying out on here. You don't really feel the warmth."," - No keyboard indicator lights for caps, scroll or num lock. I use my external gaming keyboard so not a big deal for me, but would have been nice to have for the times it's not on hand.- I wish the location of the power button wasn't above the esc key and as close to it as it is. Unless you have great coordination, you might shut off your laptop instead of closing a window, especially if you need to do it quickly.- Not very user friendly from what I've looked up in regards to future hdd/ssd swapping/replacement. You have to take off the keyboard to get to it. Not recommended unless you know what you're doing and you want to impatiently void your warranty.- While the touchpad is large and makes it easy to use without going off the edge easily all while still being out of the way of typing, I'm not a fan of the combined pad/buttons setup it has. There's no easy tactile feel to know when you're above the buttons to know you'll actually press them when you attempt to do so."," I'll list off more when I've actually had this longer than a few days, but overall I love the computer. Windows 10 is better than I thought it would be and the cons also aren't a deal breaker for me since I can work around them (external keyboard and mouse), but something to keep in mind if you don't have those extras or don't care to use them.",3,4

The other differences are the SSD solid state drives which is actually a thumb drive that is faster higher capacity more than the regular thumb drives. The three other models are all identical except as shown the drives take a step up on each model. You can swap the drives but the ram is soldered and cannot be upgraded to 16 gig which all of the listed models are capable of using, I install 16Gigs of PNY Ram for 55$ and installed a PNY SSD 240GB drive for 59$, if you take any of the other models listed you will not find any significant differences in the operation of this MBP. NONE!. It has the same hardware except for the processor and Ram, it has the USB3 ports, 4.4 Bluetooth and the list just goes on. I have not yet heard the fan come on and I get over 9 hours of battery surfing the web, the bottom of the computer doesn't even get warm, its amazing! You hear from those that just do not realize that this isn't the same model as the 2012 model it came out with, it has that in it's name to describe the MB. No it's not four years old, mine was made in May 2016 & I bought it in June, take your serial number to the Apple site and you can get a build date. This is also the only MB that has a DVD/RW for those that need to create Logs, backups and Movies etc. If you do not want the DVD you can add another SSD with no GB limit for 40$ plus the drive in it's place and get an external DVD or keep it and get an external SSD. I cannot speak highly enough for this MBP, it is by far the best one you can upgrade for your hard earned money if you just use it for photo editing and internet operations. I paid 899$ on sale, SSD 59$ and the 16 gig ram 55$ and got a monster of a MacBook Pro for 1013$.", I can't think of one, I could list more but too tired of typing it all.,None,None

I am an IT professional and use this machine for things the vast majority of users would never think of. I immediately upgraded to 8GB of ram upon receiving it and so far have had no complaints. I can comfortably run a Windows 7 virtual machine and swipe back and forth between that and the Mac OS 10.9 host with no noticeable lag. If I boot into my Windows 8.1 partition I can play games with lowish settings and decent frame rates this includes rift, swtor, and world of tanks(at a little above minimum). If I play WoW, which is extremely rare these days, I can run it at medium settings with 40-50 fps. Not bad for intel integrated graphics. Honestly, it does more than I ever though was possible with an entry level(for Apple) 13"" laptop. I am typically a Windows user, and though OS X leaves something to be desired in the ways of window management, it still isn't bad. As for an average day to day user for checking email, watching youtube videos, and the occasional flash game, this will never be an issue. But, for a power user, the lack of reasonable window management can be frustrating. It is excellent for swiping back and forth between two full screen windows, but any more than that becomes cumbersome. Any time I do any web development, or extensive work with spreadsheets and databases and I feel burdened by the software. I also have a seperate Windows 8.1 partition which I use periodically for games. With the Apple bootcamp software, the trackpad and keyboard work wonderfully, take a slight hit in battery life, but otherwise, it works seamlessly. I would recommend this laptop to anyone that wants excellent battery life and quality.",None,None
9SIA6V656F2199,34-100-228,5/25/2013 4:35:30 PM,Anonymous,"Possibly the last great, cheap MacBook Pro",5," I own this, but didn't get it from Newegg (sorry guys, was able to get a much better deal with a NYC outfit this time around).I previously built a Hackintosh using Newegg components and really started to like OS X and the Apple ecosystem. I then decided to get a Macbook - but which one? The Air is an amazing machine, so slim and light. But I'm used to building things and tinkering with them.Enter the 2012 Macbook Pro.By getting the lowest ""base"" version, it opens up a great opportunity to expand.First, you can upgrade the 4GB RAM to 16GB. Most of the major memory manufacturers will sell this for around a hundred dollars.Second, you can swap out the 500GB drive for a SSD. I went with a 256GB model and it flies. I'm getting over 300MB/s writes and around 500MB/s reads. SSD cost was under two hundred dollars.Third, you can swap out the optical drive for a second hard disk. I put in a 500 GB Scorpio Black. Even with full drive encryption I'm getting 62 MB/s writes and 74 MB/s reads (was getting close to 90 unencrypted). Total cost including the drive, the optibay adapter on your favorite auction site and an external caddy for the DVD drive was under a hundred dollars.Total time to upgrade everything, including cloning the SSD from the original HDD, probably a couple of hours tops.So, for around four hundred you're getting a configuration for a lot less (Apple's configuration including a max of 8GB and a 256GB SSD, but NO optibay drive is $500 more). Why is this possibly the last, great, cheap (relatively speaking) Macbook Pro? The retina models coming out now no longer have upgradable RAM. The SSDs are a lot harder to swap out, and whatever storage you have on the SSD is pretty much it.With my config I have tons of space on the SSD for program files and important docs, and run Parallels images and music files from the second HDD.The CPU is sufficiently fast; I've never felt bogged down (especially with the SSD upgrade) and Parallels runs any Windows apps I need like a champ. Note: Newegg often runs deals on Parallels.", Can't think of any serious ones. If were to nitpick I'd say that the magsafe adapter pops out a little too easily sometimes.,,1,2
9SIA6V656F2199,34-100-228,5/16/2013 5:10:46 AM,Kevin C.,Nice when it works,2," Looks good, feels well built. Screen looks nice (though I prefer matte finish). Hardware is pretty good, runs most things without a problem. Nice keyboard, nice trackpad. I honestly liked using this laptop, until..."," ...things started breaking. Now I baby my electronics, I don't throw them in a bag or toss them on the table or whatever that causes wear on other people's laptops. I had no dents, no scratches on this laptop, I even had a screen protector on it and a keyboard cover. One complaint, the laptop always ran a bit warm. In fact, on occasion it would get very hot and I could hear the fan spool up and make noise. Come to find out, it's because I watch YouTube videos a lot as well as go to other flash websites and OSX is very inefficient at playing back flash - uses a lot more resources than it should. After about 3 months, it started getting so hot the laptop would shut off. I took it in to the Apple store and they had it for about a week, a defective heatsink they told me. I don't see how that's possible, a heatsink can't really be defective...maybe the fan, but I heard it spinning still and I already cleaned it out to make sure dust wasn't clogging it up. So that fixed I was good for about another month, then the thunderbolt port just stopped working. Back to the Apple store, this time they told me the logic board was bad and replaced it. Was really getting worried at this point because I didn't buy Apple care, but so far all under warranty repairs. I was using it up until last month, and now the trackpad has decided to stop working. I've been using it with a mouse and that's fine, but I need to take it back to the Apple store to fix the trackpad now."," I'm really disappointed in the longevity of this MacBook Pro considering how much it cost. I expect a lot better out of a $1,200 laptop. Before this I used a few cheap PC laptops, and while they were never super fast they did always seem to work. I got tired of having to replace those PC laptops all the time along with the shoddy build quality so I thought a MacBook Pro would be the solution. My warranty runs out this summer and I'm honestly just too afraid of something else going wrong on this. I'll get called the PC fanboy or whatever, but I just want something reliable that works. I'm going to switch over to a ThinkPad when I can sell this - I have a co-worker who has been on a T410 for the past few years without a hitch, and a company I recently did some contract work for also had a fleet of ThinkPads all going strong. Thing is, I can get a well equipped ThinkPad for about $750 which is going to be as fast as my MacBook Pro was - sure it will be running Windows, but as an IT professional I found myself running Win 7 VM all the time since Visual Studio and SQL Server still have no Mac versions and are required for the work I do.My qualms are not so much with OSX as it is with Apple's QA, I could accept a defect but going on the third one? I can't tell you the last time I had to replace anything on a PC laptop except the battery and a hard drive on one (But hard drives die randomly all the time, so I don't associate that with the vendor of the laptop). A friend of mine had to replace the logic board on his MacBook Pro out of warranty and it cost him about $400 which scares me to no end. A laptop should not experience critical failures if it's less than a year old (Heck, I ran on an old Dell from 2006 up until two years ago!). If you search around you'll find that MacBook Pros do have some QA problems, and that's just unacceptable given the kind of money Apple is charging for these. They're great on their warranty, but if you run out of it - well, you'll be spending a lot of cash.",3,3
9SIA6V656F2199,34-100-228,1/10/2013 9:52:16 PM,Sean P.,Price,4," Coming from a 17 inch Windows based laptop the smaller form factor is awesome for travelling, which I do a lot of. I've owned other Apple products in the past, including an late 07 Mac Mini and Macbook and several iPods and iPhones and I'm nothing but impressed by this product.I initially bought my wife the base 15 model which she loves.. My Windows laptop was failing so I decided to order the 13 inch to try out. I've debated between returning this machine and going bigger but I love this form factor. Performance is awesome on the base 13 but I think overall for price and longevity the 15 might be a better option. I bought a base level 15 for myself to compare this weekend, I bet that the increased performance from a Quad i7 and discrete graphics might sell me on the bigger machine. Either way I love Apple computer products.. Fast, reliable and well built."," Pricey for a lower end machine, they could have included 8gig rams instead of 4... Maybe make a 13 with discrete graphics and Quad core? As I said above I LOVE this form factor and design but the performance improvements in the 15 are huge!",,1,2
9SIA6V656F2199,34-100-228,12/28/2012 7:34:57 PM,Rev. H.,Excellent notebook computer,5," Overall, an excellent machine.  It's lightweight, the fan is absolutely silent in all but the most taxing of applications.  The battery life is stellar at 7+ hours.  It rarely gets warm to the touch at all (during 'typical' use, such as web browsing or desktop publishing, it stays cool to the touch).Graphics performance is actually pretty impressive.  The HD4000 Graphics are miles ahead of previous intel offerings.  The magsafe connector is fantastic, no more broken charging ports for me!I can never go back to a laptop without a backlight keyboard again, what a handy feature!Mac OS is incredible.  Windows is such a chore to use now, once you've been spoiled with the OSX experience."," It's a bit pricey.  Some will say you can get a similar laptop for a lot less money.  I don't think so (see below), but, if all you need is the same CPU, RAM and Graphics card, and don't need all of the features that make this unique, then you can spend a lot less money on a windows laptop.The aluminum enclosure is gorgeous, dissipates heat and thus stays cool, but may be very scratch prone.  However, because it's such a popular laptop, there are lots of protective options.The screen is bright, glossy, and beautiful.  However, it's smudge city.  It's difficult to keep clean, and attracts fingerprints.  Mini DisplayPort is the only video output option, which requires an adapter or dongle of some sort in order to handle most displays.  Though there are miniDP to HDMI dongles, there is no HDMI port on this machine.It isn't also a spaceship."," Some have commented that it's a 'waste of money' or that you can get 'the same thing' cheaper.  Well that's not true.  If you want cool, quiet, 7+ hours of battery life, a sturdy enclosure, state of the art I/O, all in a lightweight and portable form factor, you can't.  Dell and HP both offer similar laptops, with the same LiPo batteries (though still not quite as long of a battery life), many similar features, and the same basic specs, but they are as expensive or more expensive than the MacBook Pro.Bear in mind, however, that you are paying for certain things that you need to decide if they are worth it for you.  You CAN get an i5/4GB of RAM/Integrated Graphics laptop cheaper elsewhere.  Do you need a bright display, backlit keyboard, LiPo battery (others may promise 7+ hours of battery life, but if it's Li-Ion or otherwise, aka not LiPo, then within a few months that battery life will be drastically shortened), a silent laptop, and tons of available accessories and upgrade options?  Well, then this is for you!I am running this with 16B of RAM and two 256GB SSD's (a third party accessory allows you to install a hard drive in the optical drive spot) in RAID 0.  Performance is mind boggling out of such a small laptop.  I also have it attached to a 27"" IPS display, AND a 23"" LCD.  It drives a 2560x1440, 1920x1080 and the built in 1280x800 display all at the same time, with no performance issues whatsoever.  It's really a powerhouse.  I do have a homebuilt gaming PC, but it's now been reduced to gaming only, as the MacBook is capable of performing as well or better at all other tasks.",0,2

The first one was a MD102LL/A and this one (MD101LL/A).  I purchased the first computer from a local store and it had the latest version on Mountain Lion at the time (10.8.1).  This MacBook Pro however came from a very old lot of MacBook Pros.  The box was slightly damaged, and it had OSX version 10.7.4!!  It took me all day with my slow 6mbps download speed to conduct all the required updates to get the current version on OSX (10.8.2). On the plus side I would recommend getting the MD101LL/A over the MD102LL/A if you plan on upgrading the HHD with a Solid State Drive, and bumping up the RAM to 8GBs.  You will save about $400.00 and with an SSD the difference between the i5 and i7 is not really noticeable. If you choose to purchase this computer you may want to consider going to the Apple Store instead of Newegg since there is no real savings.

Cant quite figure it out. Replicates on both external display and on laptop display.Output Hz for monitors is based on Intel built-in display. Why??? Yes I knew there was an onboard but I did not realize the onboard would ever be relevant. Instead it is a chokehold on output to external display. I suspect this is also the meaning of the drop in FPS in Overwatch.Display blacks out on sleep now... Have to do a full reboot power cycle for it to work.Bloatwear is confusingly excessive - there is clearly a webcam built in but windows doesnt find it. Even with some random software pre-installed I cant seem to access it. There are at least 3 installations of software that supposedly impact/improve performance and it just seems silly.

Great feedback and click feel.-General specs: storage size, ssd, ram, cpu, gpu, chassis, cooling, etc are all great. While doing research for a new laptop (took my time for two weeks), I saw them all... Gigabyte, Asus, Acer, Aorus, Alienware, you name it. Not only was I looking for a good performance oriented laptop, but one just as equally as aesthetically appealing. The GTX 970M is one of the top 3 performing mobile GPU's at the moment. It runs all games at max settings without getting overly heated. I even hooked a 3K monitor up and it still killed it.-Weight: one of the lightest 17.3"" laptops on the market clocking in at just shy of 6 lbs.-Minimal bloatware for factory pc. Big plus."," -Speakers: underamplified if you ask me... it utilizes Dynaudio, but still slightly weak for my taste. then again, it's laptop speakers... that's why we have audio jacks!-Drivers: almost EVERY SINGLE THING on this is out of date and needs immediate attention. I know almost every factory computer is like this, but here's where I had problems... half of the updates wouldn't work. For example, the Steel Series Engine software needed updating so I did it, but then I couldn't open the Steel Series Engine software at all. I had to uninstall it and reinstall to get it to work. Same for GPU driver. just plain annoying.-Windows 10: need I say more. Windows 7 please."," For a mid-high end performance gaming laptop, I'd say my money was well spent. My last laptop was also an MSI, and I'm glad they made a product good enough to keep me in the family.

I've traveled across the typical gaming brands, and this time around I went with the MSI.  The overall build quality of the machine is noticeable, and the fact they put the rig together in a less cumbersome package than the last two rigs I've purchased (from other MFGs) was nice.I could go on and on about how nice it looks or how fast it is, but you can already see that for yourself.  It looks as nice in person as it does in the photos, and was an overall slimmer laptop than I'd expected.  A nicely designed rig."," -First and foremost, I would have given this machine five stars if it had come with a Professional license of Windows...and hadn't had a graphics failure in the first twenty minutes of use.-I had hardly finished the Windows setup when the graphics driver failed (multiple times) and the screen flashed various colors--ultimately sticking a rosey pink hue over the screen. It's obvious I simply received a machine with either a bad GPU or bad VRAM, which happens.  I've been building and buying PC's long enough to remember the days when sacrificing a lamb seemed to be a prerequisite to get a working mobo in the mail; so with that in mind, having a laptop with damaged graphics really doesn't seem all that bad.  I did a moderate amount of troubleshooting--but I manage a network for a living and didn't want to spend [even more] time troubleshooting my own laptop when I can throw a pen in any direction and hit another machine that needs work.Long story short: I RMA'd mine, but I still believe this particular model should be considered a 4 of 5.

I usually present by using live demos.  I also wanted something that could support light gaming while I travel, and that I could dual-boot.This lap-top has been perfect.  It's much smaller and lighter, so it's way less of a hassle to cycle with and walk around campus.  It has a much better battery (6+ hours under normal use) which makes it much less irritating to present with.  The SSD is also extremely fast, which is nice, and it has enough horse-power to run Visual Studio fluidly.I dual-booted it.  Hardware support under Linux - both Fedora 23 and Ubuntu Gnome 15.10 - has been excellent, with one single exception.  The system uses a hybrid GPU lay-out, with both an integrated GPU on the CPU die and an discrete GPU.  That set-up did not work correctly with either OS.  On Fedora, the system recognized the discrete GPU and used it with a GL3 profile, but it locked the display resolution at 800x600; I couldn't figure out how to change it.  Ubuntu Gnome 15.10, if glxinfo is any indication, does not correctly recognize the discrete GPU.  However, it has not limited the display resolution: the display works at full resolution, and it still has GL3 acceleration (through the on-die GPU).  Perhaps more annoyingly, with Ubuntu's older kernel, power management cannot turn of the discrete GPU, which impacts battery life - I get about 3 hours under Ubuntu, as opposed to 6+ on Windows.I went through this with my last lap-top, which also used a hybrid set-up.  It took about a year before the whole thing was correctly supported, I'm assuming that the next round of releases will support this set-up correctly.UI scaling is still a little dodgy, both in Windows and with Gnome.  Gnome apps work great, but non-Gnome apps don't scale correctly - which means they're tiny.  (I also had to prevent some Java class-files that were part of the Accessability system from loading, because they were crashing Java Swing applications.)  Windows UI scaling works a little better - and the scale is adjustable, unlike Gnome's, which is locked at 2x.  However, apps that do custom painting can still break - steam looks horrible, and the MechWarrior on-line GUI breaks if UI scaling is on.Finally, if you're going to dual-boot, know that Windows 10 license work differently.  They don't have product keys, they're locked to a key associated with your UEFI loader.  Before you re-install, in Windows, you need to create installation media so you can restore from that.  I stupidly didn't think the re-installation process through and wound up buying a new copy of Windows 10, herp-derp.",7,7

It stutters every time.- The discrete graphics card is fine for older games but forget running most new games at a decent resolution.- Because this is tiny, you're looking at a non-removable 3 cell battery, which is fine but not remarkable.

You can look at the Surface book which has similar specs but costs roughly twice as much.  Otherwise, you could move up to 14"" gaming notebooks (Razer/Aorus) which are great systems but also costs around twice as much (or even more).

It's pretty much on par with a desktop grade i3 from 4-5 years ago and that's not bad at all in my opinion.-good cooling, the cpu stays pegged at 3.1ghz boost clock under decently high loads while fan noise stays reasonable. Use headphones while listening to anything at a comfortable volume and you won't hear fan noise while at full load, at idle you can tell it's turned on but it's basically silent at idle.-8gb of ram, Hey you, yeah you... you like browser tabs? dat's good mayn, dat's reeeel good. You can upgrade to 16gb if you've got serious tabaholism or if your workflow demands it, I'm personally considering it.-SSD storage, boots up quick and file transfers are snappy, dunno what kind of interface it's one, some of these acer laptops just use SATA even though it's an M.2 drive which could go faster theoretically. I have no complaints and it's already have full.-1080p screen, it's got a matte finish and very good viewing angles from the side. For a laptop I have nothing to complain about. If your eyes aren't that good the screen resolution won't do much for you. -The aesthetic is professional, I removed the stickers near the keyboard which makes this thing nice and stealthy (isopropyl alcohol helps get the sticky residue off, vodka works to but requires more elbow grease, and precious vodka). It's all plastic of course but there's no glossy finish anywhere but the acer logos, instead you get a nice brushed finish or roughened finish. You'll be hard pressed to fingerprint this thing. It altogether feels like a solid, quality product compared to other laptops I've encountered, without feeling like such a sharp-edged brick like your usual standard issue business laptop for the corporate drones. If you want your laptop to look like a neon lit honda integra on cut springs from 15 years ago driving through a korean starcraft competition, you'll be disappointed. I have no problem using this in more professional environments.-The only complaint about the keyboard I have is there's no N-key rollover so some inputs while gaming don't work, not a big deal, there isn't any flex to speak of and the keys don't have the usual loose and mushy feel of cheaper laptops. Since it's a bigger laptop the keyboard is well sized, I have long fingers and have no problem typing up this 5000+ character review.-discrete GPU with 2gb of GDDR5, this is really the thing that makes this laptop compelling both for work, play and home theater use. For general video related tasks this makes up for intel chip's main weakness which is the integrated gpu (ugh!). The 940mx isn't going to get you the full PCMR (lol) experience but it's so much better than onboard intel ""graphics"" even just for the driver support and there's plenty of great PC games that aren't graphically intensive. MMOs, CS:GO, RTS games, competitive games in general will play at 1080p 60fps at least with decreased but still very reasonable settings. If you've got a backlist of games you haven't played from the last 5 years or more you can have a lot of fun with this. Most of my steam and GOG library can run just fine on this at 1080p at least with some tweaking. Aside from gaming, the GPU is probably a boon for 1080p video editing if that's your thing. I'm an engineering student and can report that solidworks can utilize the GPU, which is nice but you have to use the right driver, usually an older one. Technically Quadros and firepros are the only officially supported GPUs but ain't nobody got $$$ for that, plenty of people run it off gaming GPUs just fine, it just might take some tweaking. It makes a difference when you get it working."," -A bit heavy and bulky to carry around, I kind of have to cram it into my backpack, it can take up a lot of deskspace and I think it weighs nearly 7 pounds, get a 15 inch if that bothers you (personally I can use the extra exercise and I love the extra screen size)-limited drive space, remedied by an external drive-single channel memory, i believe an extra stick of ram will give you dual channel, higher speeds and more channels gives you higher cpu performance in my experience, though it can be a bit slight.-battery isn't removable, I love hotswapping batteries like rifle magazines on plugged in laptops to charge them up while doing other stuff but alas, this laptop prevents such nerdiness -4 eggs! jk-no dvd drive if you wanted that"," This laptop works quite well as an all-rounder. If it's going to be your only computer, it'll work well enough for all the computery things I would assume you're going to do. For what most people do on a windows machine I think this is a great investment. My workflow can be heavier than average sometimes I suppose. Running 5 excel workbooks simultaneously with very large data sets will hit the CPU hard and make it lag and chug, it's no workstation powerhouse but for less ridiculous multitasking the performance is quite adequate especially considering the price, I'm satisfied. My desktop's performance blows it out of the water (overclocked i5, gtx 970) but when I'm not home I sometimes need to get stuff done and this works adequately provided I take it a bit easy. For gaming, especially lighter/older games this is adequate for pushing 60fps at 1080p, it's no console killer but it will allow you to play some of the best PC games. It's not the most mobile device ever but it's good if you're moving from desk to desk, outlet to outlet. It's like a relatively inexpensive mobile desktop and that's why I bought it, money well spent in my opinion.",4,4

It would have been nice, however, if they had included a bezel to add to a purchased drive to keep the case uniform. -No backlit keyboard. :cries:"," I purchased this for one of my employees.  We will occasionally game in the office when things are slow.  (we drink beer too...  best boss ever amirite?) I looked over the specs and expected this to do fine with the games we occasionally play (WOT, SW:TOR, Dota 2), and it actually does well.  WOT plays with improved graphics 1080, most settings on medium to medium high at a solid 50-60fps.  The other games also have no issues.  Will you be playing SW Battlefront at max settings... no.  Will it run and look decent? Sure!This is the first Dual core I've purchased since I owned a core 2 duo back in the day.  It does fine for our office work, and the games we run, but multi-tasking, it struggles.  For instance, if windows is doing an update in the background, forget about playing any games while that happens.  A quad core has no issues... but the dual cores do.  I have to say, we've only had it a couple weeks, but the quality of the build so far, has impressed me.  The outer case is nice, feels sturdy.  The keyboard keys themselves are a little ""lighter"" than I'm used to.  But, the keyboard feels solid, no flexing.  Touchpad worked great and as expected.  Also, I had zero issues with drivers or anything right out of the box.  Everything just worked. I did have to remove some junk software, but overall, you're going to get that with just about every laptop these days.I haven't personally owned an acer product since I was in high school and my dad purchased us a Pentium 133 that came with 16mb(not a typo) of ram and a 1.2gb(not a typo) hdd.  We though it was amazing...  It wasn't.  We needed 2mb(not a typo) of video memory to run Starcraft 1 well... it only had 1.  We bought a new video card and threw it in the slot, but there was no way to deactivate the on board via the bios.. and windows 95(not a typo) lost it's mind when we tried to boot up with two video cards. The other experience I have had with Acer is more recent (past 4 years) with a buddy who purchased an acer laptop.  It was good enough, but the screen was garbage.  I am happy to say, with THIS laptop, the screen looks great.  Is it 4k? No.  Is it bind blowing? No. But remember how much you are paying for a 17"" laptop that can actually play games acceptably.  If you're on a budget, but like to game, and don't mind having medium settings... this is a good laptop to pick up.  The battery life (so far) has been great as well.  Very happy with this purchase.  Which is more than I can say for the MSI Leopard Pro I purchased for myself the same day.  It was far more expensive, and had much better specs.  Would've been nice if it worked when I opened the box.  The Wifi was broken the second I booted. The HDMI port was non-functional. And the fans ran at 100% speed ALL THE TIME.  The first two I fixed with drivers, the third I fixed with a bios flash.  It's sad to me that MSI was willing to let something that just simply didn't work out of their door.  It was the first MSI I purchased, and will probably be the last.  Back to ASUS ROG for me.  But I digress.The acer... the one I'm actually reviewing... Thumbs up for what it is.  Very happy.",8,8

The processor is slower and the screen is smaller, but it came with a standard hard drive instead of the SSD stick this laptop uses.It also had an optical drive included, instead of an empty bay like this device. (I replaced the Lenovo optical drive with an SSD anyway.)This probably won't be an issue for most users, but when I received the Lenovo:  I turned it on, wiped the hard drive without ever booting into Win10, and installed Ubuntu 16.04 without a hitch. No problems ever since.I've had a few hours to mess with the Acer and I have yet to get it to even recognize a ""bootable device"" after installing Ubuntu using several different methods.  This includes removing the SSD stick and using a formatted and functional drive to eliminate the SSD stick as the source of the issue.It WILL run the OS from a live USB, but that's the best I've gotten so far.  But Ubuntu will not recognize the OEM wifi device.  I had to use an external antenna to connect to the internet.-Many of the options in BIOS are inaccessible.

Hopefully, this laptop can replace 2 laptops that I have. So far, I'm satisfied with it's performance given that it's a I5 processor. It boots fast and the videos that I have watched are perfectly fine. My last experience with Acer was a joke so I've not looked at this brand in years, but, so far, I'm impressed. Unlike the other reviewers, I haven't opened the back to look at anything. I would like to add more memory and learning about an extra bay for future expansion is good to know. Good value for the price. I don't think you can find a better value right now.",6,6
N82E16834315672,34-315-672,11/20/2016 3:22:55 PM,Benjamin B.,Fantastic for the price,5," InexpensiveDecent battery lifeOpen 2.5"" drive baySlot to install a slim DVD driveLots of USB ports (2x 2.0 2x 3.0 1x 3.1)"," Internal battery, not user replaceableRAM module appears to be custom for Acer, PN on it not found anywhere on the web or on Kingston's website (maybe my Google-fu is weak)M.2 SSD is SATA instead of PCI-E/NMVe, haven't determined if the connector supports PCI-E, but it's fast enough as-isKeyboard isn't backlit, replacing the keyboard would require considerable disassemblyLCD quality is good, but viewing angles leave something to be desired"," Bought this to use while deployed in Afghanistan.  So far it's exceeded all expectations, and the large screen is fantastic for movie watching (using an external DVD drive, the internal one I purchased won't arrive for another week) and using Skype to see family.  Installing an additional RAM module or populating the unused 2.5"" HDD port only requires the removal of three #1 Philips screws and a small cover.  The M.2 module is also found here, but 256GB is more than enough for an OS/program drive.  It's simple to configure Win10 to automatically use a different directory/drive for files/pictures/etc. and the open bay have room for a 9.5MM or shorter drive.  No support or padding is present, but the bay is approximately 9.54MM deep so once the drive is installed the cover should provide sufficient security.  If a drive shorter than 9.5MM is installed, adding a thin sheet of ESD safe padding might be advisable.  The M.2 SSD shipped with the laptop operates on SATA 3 versus PCI-E/NMVe, but the connector is keyed for the style module to utilize the newer standards.  Replacing the module would be easy, but not needed for my current needs.  I'll gladly test the connector for PCI-E/NMVe support is someone wants to ship one to me!Acer appears to use a very similar design for a family of Aspire E17 models, some of which include a DVD drive.  This model does have a blanking cover over where the drive would be, and the normal single screw near what would be the rear of the drive to remove the blanking cover/tray.  Visible in the rear or the slot is a slim-line SATA connector, but without either disassembling the laptop or actually installing a drive, I cannot test it.  Spending a few bucks on a drive to test was preferable to voiding my warranty just to identify if the appropriate control circuitry is present, and if reviews can be updated (this is my first Newegg review) I'll update once I know if the port is live.  Given that a near identical chassis is used for multiple similar models, I suspect the mainboard is also similar if not identical between them, including those using the optical slot.The included 8GB RAM module should be more than sufficient for most tasks, but there is a second open port.  The PN on the included module (KN8GB070346240E210ML00 / ACR24D4S8MB-8) isn't found on the Kingston or Newegg site, but the laptop should support the 8GB DDR4 units Newegg does sell, at least according to the Kingston qualified memory list for this model laptop.  Annoyingly, CPU-Z reports the RAM as having a PN starting with ACR, which doesn't correlate with any common Kingston DDR4 SODIMM modules.  Again, any of the modules Newegg sells would likely work (don't quote me or hold me liable if you try it and fail, I won't be testing this until after I return to the states), but you might not be able to enjoy the benefits of dual-channel mode.Overall, the laptop is a solid deal.  It's fairly large/heavy (not a con, you don't buy a 17"" laptop and expect portability)Once I return to the US the laptop will become a desk ornament versus a mobile workstation.  The options for expandability (HDD/RAM) should ensure the laptop remains a competent bit of hardware for several years to come.  The latest Intel mobile processor paired with the discrete GPU/GDDR5 should allow moderate gaming.  Not a hobby I'll partake, but several of my peers are eyes this for that purpose.  5/5, would buy again.",22,22
N82E16834315714,34-315-714,2/18/2017 11:20:53 AM,Christina R.,Very Nice,5," 1. Price was great2.  Screen is beautiful.  1920x1080 goodness.  Nice glossy look.3. ""Convertible"" laptops are super convenient.4. The look of the laptop is just beautiful5. The Back-lit keyboard is nice in low light or nighttime use ,it goes off after a few minutes and back on when you use it.6. Touch screen is super responsive and very accurate.7. The hardware is decent in it."," None of these are truly cons or worth deducting any eggs for.  Just my feelings and opinions.1. The power button is on the side of the machine which is just weird IMO.2. The battery is not removable.  I am assuming you gotta take the unit apart to change/replace the battery.3. No SSD.  No biggie though.  Just nowadays with how everything has an SSD in it I was kinda surprised.  I plan to add one in the coming weeks.  it has a 5400rpm in it right now which I found amusing :)4. The bloatware, my G0dz.  Its insane.  Easy to uninstall all of it but its the fact you have to spend so much time wiping it.  Thank goodness for CCleaner!5. The fans run nonstop like others report.  They are not loud so its no biggie.  Thinking the thermal solutions might not be acquitted if the fans are going constantly."," With all my ""cons"" above ( which I don't think are cons at all but rather a place for me to vent about things) this is a great laptop!  Primary got this for my wife and her tiny business she runs.  It runs so smooth and is very easy on the eyes.  All around its a great computer and I would buy it again knowing what I know now.My wife will use it for MS Word and whatnot, watching shows/movies, Youtube, Facebook, and video chatting.  So nothing hardcore or really resource or hardware intensive.  I am willing to bet you could play some games on here but I wouldn't bet it could play BF1 or The Witcher 3 very well.  I am willing to bet the frames would be pretty bad.As for the shipping.  Newegg shipped this thing super super fast from the warehouse.  I ordered it on a Friday and had it Saturday before noon, unreal shipping.  The packaging is a different story though.  I know ACER is responsible for the packaging of the laptop and it had no packaging in it.  No bubble wrap, cardboard paper, nothing.  Absolutely nothing!  The computer was just sliding around in the box.  I have no idea how it got to my house undamaged but it did.  Not a scratch on it surprisingly.  ACER needs to not do that in the future.  VERY unhappy with how they did that.  Again, I know its not Neweggs fault.All in all if you need a laptop for general use like internet browsing, small business, movie watching, light gaming, then this is for you.  If you need something with some horsepower for gaming or audio/video editing then look elsewhere.",1,1

N82E16834315714,34-315-714,1/24/2017 10:43:13 AM,Ryan M.,Preliminary review of what looks to be a fantastic laptop,5," Best value for under $400, nice IPS display, comfortable spacious keyboard layout, 2-in-1"," 5400 rpm HDD = sluggish performance, persistent loud fan noise may be bothersome to some individuals, some bloatware but easy to remove"," I spent more than a month researching laptops in the sub $400 category and decided to pull the trigger on this one.  Being refurbished I was a little worried about the cosmetic quality or if I'd have to send back for replacement or repair.  The laptop looks barely used except for a couple of light scratches on the top cover.  The scratches run along the grain of the ""brushed metal"" appearance so actually they're not very noticeable and can only be seen on close visual inspection.  The bottom cover, keyboard and palm rest were in flawless condition as well as the IPS display.  If I was to give a cosmetic grade to this laptop I'd say it's in ""Excellent Condition"".  For a letter grade rating I'd give it an ""A-"".  There is a sticker on the bottom that says Acer Recertified Product Service with a support phone number and email on it.  The colors and the brightness of the IPS display are excellent.  One of the best I've seen on a laptop.  Laptop Mag and other reviews rated the display's brightness at 310 nits which is well above average for a laptop.  This display also has a relatively thin bezel compared to other laptops I've seen which I like.  There were no dead or stuck pixels and there is minimal light bleed.  Functionally everything works just fine.  I haven't noticed any issues with the hardware.  The keyboard is wide and the keys are generously spaced apart.  The keyboard backlighting works well.  It will auto-off when the keys aren't in use after about 30 seconds and as soon as you type again the backlighting comes on instantly.  The touchscreen is very responsive.  The laptop works well in laptop, stand, tent, or tablet mode.  Make sure you turn Dolby Audio on in the audio control panel.  Your audio level, sounds and music will sound much better.  The back cover comes off fairly easy.  Just unscrew the screws and unsnap the back cover all around along the edges using a plastic pry tool so as not to scratch the cover.  You will eventually want to upgrade the HDD cause it's just too slow.  I cloned the HDD using Macrium Reflect Free and a MantisTek USB 3.0 SATA HDD/SSD External 2.5'' Case for the SSD.  I replaced it with a 240GB SSD so the performance and boot times are now much improved.  I also upgraded the total system RAM to 12 GB by adding an SK Hynix 8GB PC4-2133 RAM stick.  I have no problems surfing the web with multiple tabs open.  It can play downloaded movies and YouTube HD videos just fine.  As far as gaming goes it uses an Intel HD 520 graphics.  I can play World of Warships on 1366 x 768 on low to medium settings with 30-45 fps.  I can play CS: GO at 1366 x 768 on low settings with 60+ fps.  I can play Battlefield 4 at 1366 x 768 on low settings with 30-60 fps (avg. is 45 fps).  Regular web browsing over the laptop's wireless adapter was fine but when playing games for some reason I had some latency/lag issues.  My ping times were not stable.  I don't know if it was because of the wireless adapter or my own WiFi network so I bought an Anker USB 3.0 to RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter to connect the laptop directly to the cable modem.  After that, the latency/lag issues resolved and gaming experience improved even more.  I bought this laptop to be used for general purpose stuff like web surfing, watching movies/vidoes, emailing and light casual gaming when I'm on the go.  If you don't mind refurbished, I think this is the best full HD laptop for under $400.  Spend a little more to upgrade to an SSD and maybe to max out the RAM and you've got a very capable laptop.  Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.",1,2

No hassle, and the replacement was shipped promptly.  Replacement works great, no defects found.  I replaced the HDD with a Samsung 850 EVO 250GB SSD and did a fresh install of Windows 10, which went smoothly.  The computer now boots in under 10 seconds (from a full shutdown) and my web browsing is clean and snappy.  I found the laptop has an available M2 slot if you wanted to keep the HDD and install a tiny SSD (M2 size), though it wasn't listed on the specs.  About the only complaint left is that the fan runs almost preemptively and isn't that quiet.  I found the trackpad quality to be quite good, especially the two-finger scrolling, which is on the same level as an Apple product.  The touchscreen is pretty responsive and accurate, but the glass can sometimes drag on your fingers if they aren't completely smooth and dry.  Overall, five eggs and worth the $400 price tag, so long as you aren't trying to play video games on it (always use dedicated graphics for that).",1,1

I installed a 120 GB SSD to replace the default 500 GB HDD, and I installed Xubuntu, rather than using Windows 8. Under this situation, performance has been very good. I can boot in 10 seconds, and the laptop is very responsive with few to no errors. It also stays cool, and I have never seen temps go over 70 C, which was an issue for my previous laptop. As for gaming, it's not a gaming laptop. I can consistently play TF2 at 30fps and any 2D game at optimal performance, but I knew beforehand that Intel HD graphics weren't gaming graphics. 4GB (3.7 usable) RAM is enough for me. This laptop generally isn't powerful enough to do anything that requires more than that, so I never eat up what I have available. The major con, however, is the keyboard. It's awful. This may be the worst keyboard I have ever used. The spacebar tilts and sticks, and all of the keys are significantly less responsive than normal, especially the tab key. If I go slowly and mash the keys, there's no problem, but touch typists should be take note.

It is generally customary that a restore partition is made available for recovering the system in the event that unfortunate things happen.  It is sad that ASUS seems to disregard that practice.

The textured finish feels nice.", The plastic casing around the keyboard keys feels flimsy. Comes with McAfee installed.," My initial feelings about this laptop are positive. It's replacing my older Asus laptop, which has a low-end AMD dual core 1.65 Ghz CPU (giving it away to someone at work). This one has the i5 which is also dual core and 1.6 Ghz, however, the i5 in this has hyperthreading which makes 4 logical cores, and performance tops out around 2.5 Ghz. I caught this one operating at 2.6 Ghz for a minute or so, so it's definitely not running at 1.6 all the time. I added another 4GB of RAM to it too, so it sails pretty smoothly through everything. This is a huge improvement over my last laptop. Sure, it doesn't have a 2GB+ graphics card, an SSD, or an i7, nor is it 1080p, but it's definitely got a lot of bang for the buck. I streamed a blu-ray rip from my media server on this thing and it looked good. Obviously if you want top quality, then watch movies on your home theater system or on a full HD desktop, but considering that this has 1366x768 resolution, it looks as good as one could reasonably expect. As long as you're not trying to play games on ultra settings or anything, this thing is great. My main uses for this are productivity, social networking, and entertainment on the go, so it'll do just fine. I even played Sins of a Solar Empire on it, and it ran just fine without any hiccups.

Asus laptops do not come with Recovery Media creation options like what other vendors provide and it is very expensive for the client to purchase a new hard drive, our data back up services and wait 2 to 3 weeks for recovery media to come through Asus snail mail then bring it back to our store for servicing.", You best bet is to go with a different brand. Even Toshiba provides recovery partitions and allows you to create recovery media either to USB or DVD.,2,7
9SIA0AJ3635451,34-232-278,2/1/2015 3:00:38 AM,Anne D.,Beware!! Update,1, The one egg in my rating goes to Newegg for helping me get a response from Asus. THXThis laptop has the potential to be a nice computer.," Unfortunately that potential cannot be reached without the tools ""to allow the unit to be restored to factory settings in the event WINDOWS crashed or it is no longer bootable"" and in-spite of what some have posted their is no free recovery utility that will allow you to create your own copy or ""backup image of the system using an external USB device or SD card that can be used to reset the system to factory settings if the OS crashed"" without a licensed windows disk or recovery partition which this laptop does not have!"," I have purchased windows 7 ultimate 64 bit for this laptop so my granddaughter will finally be able to get her much needed  Christmas present in February, however the added expense makes the purchase of this laptop a poor choice. Sometimes a bargain really isn't a bargain at all. With the licensed Win 7 disc she will be able to not only have a better OS but she will have the ability to create recovery discs or a partition if she chooses. I an thoroughly disgusted with Asus at this point and they have lost a very dedicated customer and advocate.",3,4

Very nice feel overall and seems much higher quality than it costs.  Easy to access RAM and HD Upgrades, but only 1 RAM slot (4GB permanently installed).  With an 240GB M500 and a bare install it cold boots in ~7 seconds to the 8.1 login screen!"," It had a piece of paper noting the recovery partition wasn't there (it was, but it didn't contain a windows installer in my case).Upgrading to the (smaller) SSD was a huge pain.  Clones always worked for a while, but using F9 at startup to attempt recovery always bricked the install with a 0xc0000225 error.  No amount of bcdedit or fixmbr would fix it.  Only resizing the main disk partition didn't fix it either.  Couldn't get it to boot without copying the recovery partition.  Using the windows tool to copy the recovery partition from the main drive and trying to boot to it on the SSD or an external didn't get very far.Eventually I found a guide (search for ""Obtaining your OEM BIOS Embedded SLP Product Key using RW-Everything (Windows 8.0/8.1 OEM Only)"" and after just downloading the correct copy of windows (it links you to an MS download site) the install was very easy once I had the knowledge, but I wasted about 3 days sifting through red herring commands and full drive SSD writes getting there.New world, new way of doing things with UEFI I guess.

Plastic tabs on bottom are easily broken during disassembly3. Speakers are so-soHere I launch into why I gave it one star. Thomas W. is absolutely correct; the design for the hinge is unsound. If I had to guess, it would be that the spring in the hinge is wound too tight. It exerts too much torque on the entirety of the computer. It ripped the screws right out of the body of the computer. I opened it up and tightened it down. Shortly thereafter, the screen started being pulled from the housing. It eventually got to the point that I super-glued the housing. This solved that problem, but then the housing starting being pulled from the hinge mount. I'm currently trying to secure that."," I recommend staying away from this computer.

The 6 GB of memory is definitely a plus compared to some of the other laptops on market today.  And specs are great for standard web browsing, office use, and the occasional lightweight game."," Taking an egg off for a few minor, but annoying issues.  Not a huge deal as it works as expected most of the time, but I've noticed some minor performance issues with the 5400 rpm HDD.  If I'm listening to music and the Windows 8 maintenance kicks on the music starts skipping until it is unplayable.  I've tested with heavy disc load so I'm pretty sure it's the HDD causing this issue.  Typical large file transfers don't seem to have a problem finishing at all, but the HDD definitely slows down if something is hogging the HDD resources.The glossy coating on the bottom of the laptop also started to peel off after a month of use.  Not a huge deal, but not a very quality coating at all.There are also intermittent issues putting the laptop to sleep.  For some reason if I close the lid or actually manually put it into sleep mode it will go to sleep but instantly wake up again.  Attempting to put the laptop to sleep again is usually successful.  I've only encountered this three times now, but there is also an issue waking the laptop from sleep.  For some reason the Intel wifi antenna does not switch power states correctly and fails to load the driver (error in event log).  Restarting the computer fixes this."," I've seen many reviews that complain about the keyboard and having to strike the keys in the dead center of the key in order to type.  I *have* noticed this issue with some of the keys, but I quickly adapted to it.  Likely was just a typing posture issue.  It's also annoying to have to use the Fn key to adjust the volume.  But nothing to get frustrated over.Speakers are typical low quality laptop speakers that needed a bit of EQ adjustment to sound better.To solve the HDD issues I'll likely switch out for a SSD, which I've read is pretty easy and straight forward with this laptop.And this is not really an issue with the laptop but Asus software.  The Asus smart gesture program runs some kind of task at login to patch the touchpad functions.  If this for some reason doesn't run the extended functions of the touchpad (zoom, two finger right clicking, ect.) fail to work.  Running the task manually or restarting the program fix it.",2,2

Wish they were on top. They're not as loud as Sony or Dell laptops."," I don't like that Asus doesn't allow us to change volume, brightness, and other FN settings without pressing the FN button on the keyboard. Really annoying considering the fact that volume is on the right end of the keyboard instead of being around the f1 - f3, so I can't reach it with one hand.Not the best keyboard but it was fine. I prefer my Lenovo T500 keyboard.No optical drive but it's ok, I can use an external one."," Been using it for about 2 weeks now. I received the laptop new even though I noticed it said refurbished. I checked the life of the hard drive and it was only around 160 hours, so whoever used it only did for a week or so. It looked exactly brand-new, no blemish anywhere. I do not have any issue with the laptop itself, everything works perfect. It even smelled and still smells brand-new:)I received the model with the Atheros card but it's working fine since I'm close to the router.

9SIA0AJ3A08915,34-231-573,6/1/2014 1:23:34 PM,Alex R.,Solid Laptop,4, 1. Screen quality/size2. Backlit keyboard3. Touchscreen 4. large HDD5. Battery life6. Sturdy, 1. squeaky space-bar2. HDD not SSD3. Battery has been used4. Few scratches," Firstly, I would like to say this has been an awesome upgrade from my other laptop. My old laptop had under an hour battery, the speakers blew out, and  part of the screen shorted out... It was time for an upgrade. When I saw the key layout, I thought it was a bad idea that the power key was located on the keyboard. I figured I would be prone to accidentally  powering off the laptop (I am a meh typer) . Turns out this is not an issue for me. I have read some reviews talking about this being a fingerprint magnet. It is in a different way. I don't consider this a con or anything, because the fingerprints are more of just dark marks that go away after you let it set. I imagine this will build after some ware and tear. I just rub the spot with my hand and it goes away. Now for the positive: I am very surprised to say this, I actually like the touchscreen. I thought I would never use it, however, when I am being lazy in bed it is nice to treat this similar to a tablet. The touchscreen definitely makes Windows 8 a little more bearable. Also, the screen is 1080p and looks beautiful. I am coming from a 768 display so this is another upgrade. I have wanted a backlit keyboard for awhile so I am very happy with this feature. The lighting has a couple of levels. I recommend turning it off during the day. It makes it harder to read the keys.  Again, I need to glance at the keyboard to re-orientate myself. The battery on this has impressed so far. I can go easily 4+ hours on the web with my screen brightness up. The battery icon in the taskbar has estimated 5.5 hours of life. I have only had this a couple of days so I will get a better feel for how long the battery will hold up. Overall build quality of this laptop seems rock solid, aside from the squeaky key. Not flimsy at all. Now on to the annoying...The spacebar squeaks. At first, this seemed like a minor inconvenience. However, this has grown irritating. I will pop the key off later and see if I can fix it. The battery has been used. To be more specific, there are 666 charge cycles on the battery. I thought this was going to be a factory refurbished model, with little to no use. The battery report seems to say otherwise and says that the battery is at 96% wear level. This along with the squeaky key is the reason why I am docking this an egg. There are 3 scratches on the top and bottom. I know I am buying B Grade refurb but I was hoping to have no scratches. The keyboard and screen are flawless aside from the squeaky key. There are two versions with the same model number. 1 with a bad wifi card and an empty msata slot. The other has a great wifi card and no msata slot. I got the latter. I believe it is 5Ghz which is cool, but I was hoping to run SSD and HDD dual.  Recommendation:I whole heartedly feel like this laptop was a solid buy. I got it for $490. For all the features you get and the rock solid build, you cannot beat this deal. I am overall very ha",2,2

9SIA9B553V1975,34-314-435,7/21/2016 8:57:05 PM,Anonymous,Worth the money,4," The low price, coupled with Windows 7 makes this worth the money.  I was on the fence about the purchase, but knew I didn't want Windows 10 and needed to get something soon. I just received it yesterday, after installing the entire MS Office 2007 and Adobe Creative Suite - it runs fine.  I tend to have at least four of these programs simultaneously and  I don't have issues with lag or crashing.I have had 5 Toshiba laptops in the past and the Acer was the only one available in the price I liked and the OS.  It is light enough to take with you in a normal sized backpack or large purse tote.Extremely quiet.The laptop stays cool while - on the lap.For me the battery power works for about three hours, which for me is to be expected considering the HUGE screen size and the way I run programs and videos."," The speakers sound cheap (but not a deal breaker). The touchpad will take time to get used to, somewhat large and sensitivity needs to be adjusted somehow (but not a deal breaker).   It does have the hot-key that allows you to turn off the touchpad while typing.  So for someone like me when I know I am typing up a long letter, paper etc., you simply turn off the touchpad with one push of the button."," Overall for the price, it is a good deal.  Sure there are better laptops, not sure how many others still have Windows 7.  And of those, I wouldn't look forward to paying a higher price when this one covers all the bases. The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the large touchpad, difficulty in finding out how to adjust sensitivity, and the placement of the card-reader, which is right near the left hand.",None,None

When I tried to update windows, the machine froze 2/3 of the way through installing updates, I gave it 4 hours just to be sure.. Maybe I'm spoiled from using a workhorse desktop and I'm out of touch with capabilities of economy machines, but the freezing seems to suggest a defect."," I'm hoping that this sluggishness is just due to 1st time use/not having anything cached, and that finishing updates and optimization will resolve some of the issues.

Probably won't handle the new high-end games, but I have played S.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear Sky, on Medium res settings... no problem.  I have also played F.E.A.R. 2, on higher res no problem.  Look into the video card specs yourself to determine if it's good for you.  I played for about 2 hours and still had 20% remaining.  I bumped my power settings to power saver mode to achieve this (not hard... just select from your power icon by the clock or control panel in windows settings).It has a really nice fingerprint scan security.  You can bypass it and use the password at any time instead, but it's a nice quick entry option for security instead of the password.The back-lit keyboard.Upgrading memory is really easy (I did -- went from 4gb to 8gb).Comes with CD Media to fully restore to factory, even though it doesn't have a CD ROM (you will need an external CD ROM to do this, which I have).Has integrated system restore partition, so you can do a system restore without the disks (assuming no hard drive failure, of course).  On that note, using the disks does a truly factory restore, while using the integrated restore does not actually reinstall all the security features.  I know, because Windows became corrupt and I already had to do this.  I reinstalled from the system first, and noticed I was missing a few extras (extras I liked).  So I reinstalled from the discs, and the finger scan security was and everything was setup truly factory.  The integrated restore really just re-installs Windows, and all necessary drivers.  So still a complete and function reinstall of the OS.Very thin, and lightweight."," The back-lit keyboard is really great for working in the dark. Perhaps I should list this in the cons, and may I will, but the only thing I don't like is it only lights up when you press a key... for about 3 seconds (and continues to stay lit as you continue to press keys). I wish there was a setting to leave the back lighting on. If there is, I have not found that setting."," I build computers.  I have since very young, and have always been a desktop person.

The 4 gigs of RAM are plenty for most purposes, and EASILY upgradable. I mean, 30 seconds to swap out your RAM without tools. There's just a back panel that is securely fastened, but buttons off and it pops open effortlessly, with your SSD/HDD, RAM, and other components easily accessible and labeled, including the battery which is safely contained inside the housing. The SSD is a beast, hitting the highest PASSMARK performance scores (literally better than any comparison drives listed), and outperforming most SSD's easily. HDD's can't even compete, and this thing boots up in about 10-15 seconds. The fingerprint reader is extremely effective and usually works on the first go without being careful, which is unusual on laptop fingerprint readers.  The security features on this thing are too numerous to mention. This thing SIPS power. I mean, I went from using an i7-720m on my last laptop, which used 130-140 watt adapter, to this thing, which uses 11 watts at full load, and comes with an adapter fit for a large tablet.The case is built like a brick, while still being light. It's one giant cold piece of metal, which is rock solid, yet stunningly light. No bizarre frills or bloatware, it's a business oriented system.I really liked this laptop when I saw it, and I have to say, it was actually better than expected."," Not a one. Just be sure to perform all updates right away, and there will be a lot, as this system has not only Windows updates, but HP updates which are generous and forthcoming (and that's a good thing)."," This system says it's a $1199 system on the specs, and although they generally have it much cheaper, it really is an $1199 system. It feels like you are holding a premium product, it has powerful processing and a rapid SSD, and comes in a solid body. It has a 3 year warranty (keep your receipt, that's the official warranty instrument, otherwise they use date of production) which is a fabulous warranty for such a cheap laptop. Also, you get Windows 7 and 8 discs, in full. You don't even have to make the backups (though you have no disc drive, so you need a USB one to use them). Ultimately, I am completely satisfied at this laptop. I owned a Dell, HP, Compaq, and Acer laptop during the last 9 years. This is the first one that hits the sweet spot of powerful processing and rapid performance, coupled with low energy usage (battery longevity) and almost no heat (idles at 95 F, working at about 130 F). I've struggled for years to find that (and spent much more money), and this really does seem to be the perfect package.You absolutely can't go wrong with this system. Also, the complaints about the track pad and rubber pointer you see on some of the reviews are nonsense. It all works perfectly, though it may be possible to get better, if you're willing to drop some serious dough on a much higher system.",1,1

This computer has the best keyboard by far and I spend all day typing on it; I type more than 10,000 words per day at the minimum.The only problem I have with this laptop is the mousepad. Often times it tapping it does not register. If  I click on a link, nothing happens so I have to do it again.

9SIA0AJ2M36128,34-257-686,12/23/2014 9:02:11 AM,David S.,Definitely Recommend,5," I've been using the 840 for a year now and absolutely love it.  Our business is switching over exclusively to these to replace our aging fleets of xx40, xx60 and xx70 series of Elitebooks.  Users of the older models complained of the weight and bulk and love the new lightweight and slim desgin of the 840.  Those that used the 12"" model appreciate having a 14"" screen that weighs much less than their 12"" did.  The backlit keyboard is a huge improvement over the LED light that used to be on the screen by the camera of previous models which didn't work most of the time.The speed and performance boost from the SSD is also a big improvement.  A lot of our sales force is on the road and they can be a bit rough on PCs so not having a mechanical drive means much less support is needed because drives aren't crashing like they used to from being bumped, dropped, etc.We order all our 840s with 8GB RAM standard which is more than sufficient, but they can run up to 16GB which again for those with resource intense applications is a great option.There is also a USB port on the left side (lightning bolt) that you can use to charge your phone even when the PC is off which I find as a great benefit when needing to charge while on the go (such as walking through the airport or taking a bus/taxi someplace)."," The only con for me is the 180GB SSD that comes standard.  For most of our users it is more than sufficient, but some of the IT folks and power users could use a 250GB or 500GB SSD (I happen to run multiple VMs on mine for testing) so space is tight but it was easily fixed by installing a larger size SSD.Some people might find the lack of a CD/DVD as a con, but let's be serious.  If you're still using CD/DVD media, you need to get with the times.  USB sticks are cheap and hold a lot more data than a CD/DVD can and are much more portable.  That combined with cloud and network based storage there is no reason to need a CD/DVD drive anymore.  All media can be downloaded and installed directly.  As a member of the IT team responsible for all client applications, I can't recall a time when we had any physical media to install software over the last 2-3 years unless it's a really old program that should be retired or upgraded to a current and supportable version anyway."," Had been a fan of the Lenovo line of notebooks for a long time but the newest Elitebooks have finally tipped me in favor of the HP notebooks.

This is a BIG improvement., - i5 CPU is slower and less powerful than in the HP 8460p- SDXC Slot is exposed which allows Card to be Damaged!- No CD/DVD drive- Screen is less bright than Elitebook 8460p- USB 3.0 Ports seem slower than on the 8460p- No 54mm card slot- Black Matte Plastic Top gets fingerprints and oil marks and it is difficult to clean.," I currently own HP Elitebook 8440p, 8460p, and Probook 4525s for my small business/home use.  I now have a HP Elitebook 840G1 with 256GB SSD and 16GB Ram running Windows 7 64-Bit Pro OS  which I have been using for several months.  Up to now, I have been very happy with the HP Elitebook series laptops because they had excellent features like e-sata ports, firewire ports, Display ports, rugged mil spec construction, upgradeable, excellent support from HP, and very good performance for the price.  The previous HP Elitebooks were workhorses but they were a little heavy.I like the slimmer design of the 840G1 and the lighter weight.  The battery life is a little better than for previous models which makes it unnecessary to use an extended life battery unless you regularly take very long international flights (they now have power ports at your seat so even that isn't a reason to get a bigger battery).   I also really like the new backlighted keyboard which lets me type in a dark room.  The older little LED light on the 8460p top of screen was totally non-functional.  I also like that the keyboard top is now sturdy like the older 8440 models such that I can rest my wrists on the front of the keyboard to type without disturbing the cursor.   Those are the only things I like about the 840G1.In general, the 840G1 is a step down from the 8460p in terms of processor performance and capability.  CPU intensive applications like video transcoding are much slower on the 840G1.   The lack of a CD/DVD read/writer is also a problem for me.  I have to load the files from another PC to save them to my SSD and that is much smaller than before.With previous models I put a 128GB SDXC card in the laptop to extend the memory capacity.  The 840G1 has the slot but it does not protect the card which sticks out about 4mm.  I managed to crush a card and lost all the files from that card with this PC!!!!   This is a BIG Problem for me.  You have to remove the SCXC card whenever you are not using it and that is a Problem.  They also eliminate the 54mm card slot so you cannot The screen brightness isn't any improvement over the 8460p either.  I would say that graphics performance is the same or slightly less than with the 8460p.  It certainly isn't up to the 8460w.Bottom line - The 840G1 is lighter, slimmer, and has a longer battery life than the older Elitebooks.   To get that, you have to give up features like a faster processor, sturdiness, CD/DVD drive, e-sata port, and a good SDXC card slot and a 54mm card slot.  I want HP to make a unit like the 8460 but with the sturdiness and keyboard of the 8440.   I will take the weight to get the features.   I would give up the 840G1 in a second but I have it on lease for the next two years.",12,28

I haven't gotten more than 3 hours out of this thing, even with Power4Gear installed. And this is after installing a fresh, clean copy of Windows without all the ASUS garbage.- Way too much bloatware. You guys don't need to add software and tools that do things Windows can do just fine on its own. This is, unfortunately, a lesson that manufacturers will never learn. You build a machine with decent specs, then completely hose it with unnecessary software that kills performance right out of the box.- No Bluetooth support. I know it's a budget machine, but given the fact you only get 2 USB ports, BT would be nice to maximize the number of devices you can connect to it.- The touchpad is cheap, requires hard pressure for multi-gestures, and feels too hollow underneath. Add some extra support below it so it feels more solid. There is a lot of empty space inside this thing that could be filled with added plastic framework to add strength and reduce that ""cheapy"" feel. This would probably help the keyboard, too."," This is a great laptop for simple work tasks, e-mail, photo management, and other home office functions.I fired it up for a few minutes out of the box just to make sure everything worked, then immediately yanked the drive and replaced it with a Samsung EVO SSD with a fresh install of Windows 7.

For everyone complaining that they didn't know it was Windows 8 or they don't like Windows 8, well, you should have either read the description better or done a little research. Anyway, right out of the box I started the upgrade to 8.1, which took about 2 1/2 hours start to finish.There was quite a bit less bloatware on here than previous reviews would have led me to believe, so that was a bonus as well as I didn't have much to remove. The machine is very responsive with every task I give it; from powering up the machine to logging on is generally less than 10 seconds. The graphic display is better than expected as well with the Intel HD graphics. I only play a couple of games but performance is more than acceptable even on the highest settings.The only problem I have with this computer is the battery life. Even just web surfing or doing non-graphic intensive tasks, 3 hours is pushing it. I knew coming in that it wasn't a large battery, but for a portable machine you should expect a better effort.

Every game I can play on my PC I can play on this laptop, albeit not always at Ultra settings. The thing I've always like about the Asus gaming laptops is that they blow the hot air out the back, and I've never had the bottom get hot on me. My only gripe with this model is they moved the intakes to the bottom of the laptop, where the last generation(G71) had the intake at the top, right by the screen. This made it very convenient because there were no intake ports to block when you used it it your lap. I will say I've had no issues using this one for true laptop gaming either, but I am more conscious to make sure the large intakes are not blocked by my legs, this isn't generally hard due to the size of the laptop. It can be easily positioned in your lap to have vents hanging off to the side, or in between your legs.Asus also really loves the soft touch rubber plastic, which feels great but loves to absorb oils from your skin and is impossible to keep clean.

Storage space is awesome and all the ports are good.," Storage space is partitioned a little weird but no big deal. A bit on the heavy side, but like I said, solid.

9SIA3FA3KF3078,34-232-602,10/26/2015 10:03:32 AM,Christopher T.,Avoid this product. Wireless & QC are poor.,1, The overall performance of the laptop is great. It can handle everything you throw at it. Though the cons outweigh the pros," The wireless card is absolutely horrible. It cannot hold a stable connection, making gaming nearly impossible if you are trying to do anything competitive online. Even pinging 192.168.1.1 the card spikes to over 150ms. No other wireless device in my home will have that problem. The Intel AC7260 is a very problematic card and a simple google search will show that many people have major issues with this card.There is an issue with the sound in which whenever a sound is initialized, it will make a crackling noise. This issue is also widely known and there is so far no good fix.The laptop also arrived with 2 broken keys. Was very surprised with that.I know back light bleed is like playing the lottery but even with the brightness on a lower setting it is very clear there is a yellow glow on the left side of the screen. This is very distracting during dark scenes/games as it is almost 4 inches down the left hand side."," I should have returned the laptop right away but wanted to upgrade to Windows 10 and wait for drivers but that has not worked out. I have already sent it to an Asus Service Center in which the wireless card was replaced and the sound issue was ""fixed"". The laptop is now a paperweight because it is much too frustrating to try and fix these issues every day or even try to ignore them. Every few minutes while I am playing a game I get massive rubber banding or skips due to the wireless issue. A laptop of this caliber should not have problems like this.",7,8
9SIA3FA3KF3078,34-232-602,9/28/2015 5:40:19 AM,Matthew T.,Pretty good laptop!,4, The laptop is pretty nice. Runs just about everything on max settings (Natural Selection 2 was only getting 25-30 fps on max)Nice screen and keyboard," Comes with windows 8.1. I upgraded to windows 10 and it broke the steam shortcut button in the upper left. (not that big of a deal but thought I'd mention it).Other than that, I have found no other issues."," Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. I've only had it for 3 weeks, but it has not disappointed (besides having 8.1 haha).",6,9
9SIA3FA3KF3078,34-232-602,9/12/2015 9:38:47 AM,Brittany B.,Fast and powerful computer!,5," I bought this computer because I'll be traveling abroad and can't build/take a mammoth system with me. I was hesitant to trust in a laptop for high performance--I run multiple art and graphic design programs at one time (Photoshop, InDesign, Sketchup, etc.), so I was skeptical. I was PLEASANTLY surprised and am very happy with my purchase.First of all, the build itself is perfect. The design is flawless, and I love how the system looks. The red is a lot of fun and makes me feel like I'm running some sort of secret agent tech device--all standard PC users think I'm hot stuff, man. The keyboard is great and comfortable and has this soft texture to it that is nice to rest the hands on, and the lighting effects are awesome and make it easy to see in any lighting. Plus, the system feels really sturdy. I don't toss my laptops around much, but I feel like this thing could take it if I did. The lid is so tight and secure, and I love that! The vents in the back are great, and the system does not run warm AT ALL. I ran this alongside my older, less powerful laptop while I was switching over data, and my other laptop felt like it was going to burst into flames before this one even started to feel warm at all (both the system itself and the power adapter). This one is so quiet, too, and that's awesome. Steady cooling AND quiet fans are awesome. The graphics on this system are amazing. It has the most vibrant colors I have ever seen. The SSD and standard hard drives are great, too, and the combo makes this computer SO FAST. It starts up in like 4 seconds. My old laptop took a good 30+ seconds to get going. I can start up programs in a flash and run multiple large programs thanks to plenty of RAM. It has plenty of nooks and crannies and USB slots and such to run everything I need and more, too.It starts with WIndows 8.1 but is easy to upgrade to Windows 10. I did have to temporarily disable my NVIDIA driver to upgrade, but aside from that, it was smooth sailing. I haven't had any problems with anything since the transition. ASUS also offers driver updates for Windows 10 upgrades, too. Thanks, ASUS!"," Everything that is a con is actually mostly fixable. Do not get distressed and give up on this thing without doing some research/customizing!! One size does not fit all, and this computer lets you change things to your liking (and I LOVE that).So first of all, the screen was almost TOO bright when I got a hold of it. It is at a really high resolution, and the screen is set very bright. You can adjust the brightness, gamma levels, and color balance to tone it down significantly--I am currently set at a level similar to my older HP laptop, but still with more vibrant colors than ever before. Furthermore, the touchpad works almost like a smartphone; you can zoom in and zoom out if things are difficult to read, and it really helps the eyes. Not only that, but you can adjust the size of text, so high resolution is quite easy to cope with if your eyes bug out.Second, the audio is not that phenomenal. In fact, it was sort of echo-y. However, after I downloaded the most recent driver from ASUS, it sounded much better. It's not the best audio, but I'd say it's pretty similar to anything else you'd get a hold of from a laptop nowadays. All the intense gamers of the world can put their gaming headsets to use if absolutely necessary.My only other complaint is that the DVD drive is on the left side of the machine right at the front where you might grab with your hands. I read this as a common complaint and didn't take it seriously. But literally whenever I move the computer, I open the dang drive. I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually, so it's not at all a deal-breaker, but it does drive me crazy sometimes."," My previous laptop regularly overheated and ran out of memory, so those were two things I looked for specifically when buying a new system. I picked this beast because I had been recommended ASUS by a friend and because it promised lots of memory and a cool experience. I have not been disappointed. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a sturdy, powerful system. Good job, ASUS!",18,18

Nice screen, good keyboard feel, not too heavy."," Has a lot of ""crud"" installed (not a bunch of trial-ware garbage, but the stuff they do pre-install takes up a lot of space)8gb ram is a little low (but again, cheap enough to upgrade after the fact, and very easy to do)Case does show fingerprints, if that bothers you. Track pad default settings are a bit overzealous and can be aggravating at times (this is a relatively minor gripe though)There's another that is a big negative but not really an out-of-the-box issue."," Do not waste your time creating recovery media. It will take all afternoon, and then it doesn't work. At all. Not even a little bit. I had a spare ssd laying around that I wanted to install, and thought it would be a good test of the recovery media. After booting off of the boot disc (which, is not disc #1) I clicked next, accepted the EULA and it popped up a rather generic ""ERROR OCCURRED""And that was that.

Coming from the T500, the body of the E560 feels a little cheap and delicate. I immediately noticed a couple bright spots around the edge of the screen. The off-center track pad really bothers me, as I'm constantly hitting it by accident (I prefer the keyboard without the numpad, though that's personal preference). When it arrived, I was happy with the machine. Good all around general purpose work machine, though it certainly didn't wow me by any means. About 3 months in, the backlight of my screen went out (something that also happened with my T500 after about 6 years). I ran it off an external monitor for a bit, until I could send it in for repair. I read about a few other people having the same backlight issue, which was apparently an easy fix, but I didn't want to void the warranty. I sent it in for repair, which took quite a long time. Apparently, they replaced the entire screen with a new screen, which was also dead on arrival (not optimistic about the screen between mine and stories of others). They then replaced it AGAIN, but somehow (not sure whether the fault of the repair shop or the laptop), the motherboard also died during the repair and had to be replaced as well, along with a third screen replacement.It came back and seems to work fine, though the bright spots around the edge of the screen are still there, the case is now cracked, the hinges are held together with tape (came like that from the repair shop) and the webcam and microphone no longer work, which leaves me stranded for online calls and meetings. I'm hesitant to send it back in again with all the trouble of the first time.Overall, it's a good average machine for browsing, light gaming (Minecraft, etc), and Development work (WAMP server, IDE, general development tools), and the battery lasts FOREVER, but it is delicate and I'm worried about what else may go wrong with it in the future.",None,None

I changed the RAM to two 8GB Ripjaws modules and the hard drive with a 1TB Crucial M550 SSD.

So far, I haven't had any problems with Kali or Ubuntu and TAILS 2.6 loads without any startup modifications!  Also, 8GB of RAM was a little weak so I upgraded it to 16GB with a single 8GB DDR3 1600 PC-12800 module from G.Skill that matched the timings, which by the way, are 11-11-11-28 1T.  Not satisfied with a mechanical hard drive, I opted to upgrade to a Samsung 850 EVO 500GB SSD.  Works great in this ThinkPad.  For only about $200 I upgraded this laptop to a $1200-1400 price range equivalent.  xDOh and ordering the USB drive with Windows 10 was simple.  Lenovo has a pamphlet inside on how to do it.  Basically you go to a website, create an account, input your serial number and they'll mail you a free USB drive preloaded with Windows 10 via UPS.  Shipping time is about 2 weeks.  Or you can opt for a download of Windows 10 to your hard drive.  I opted for the USB drive.",1,1

I've used it for 5 minutes now and am pleasently surprised. In my opinion, there hasn't been a decent trackpad with Thinkpads that I've used since the e520. This is responsive and clicks as expected (unlike the e540 for example). Spending so much time in the field and not always having an external mouse, this was a huge annoyance to me. This is bordering on the Macbook trackpads (which were my favorite to use). It does exactly what you ask it to unlike some of the past few generations."," In my limited time with it, I am not a fan of FN keys being over at the edge. Then again I don't know if there is a great place to put the FN key."," I was so happy with the trackpad, I had to write my first review. I have spent no time with the actual computer yet besides getting it set up for the end user. Based on the specs, it should be a work horse and be overkill for who ends up with it. I will update this review if anything changes.

Sturdy.  I like the rubberized feel; won't slip.  Minimal bloatware (none I've felt compelled to remove yet).  Easy to add RAM and replace HDD with SSD.  Very nice, bright 1920x1080 display.  Included HDD is 7200RPM. Sorry no Speedtest numbers, but the wireless /feels/ fast. It hasn't gotten even warm under constant non-gaming use. I'm not sure I can hear the fan.  Separate numeric keypad. Lenovo seems to have retained its near-legendary quality even years after IBM sold them."," No HDD or DVD activity LEDs.  No charging indicator when it is powered off.  OSD for CAPSlock, but no LED for that or for Numlock.  USB ports not color coded as to type (they're all black).  HDD is GPT even though it's only 500GB; see other thoughts.  Battery life is good, but there is plenty of room for an even bigger battery.  Included RAM is only CAS11. Bizarre: power plug is rectangular with a center pin rather than the more typical round with center pin, so even though it's the same 20V, I can't use any of my other Lenovo adapters with it (including a car adapter)."," I replaced the HDD with a SSD primarily for power saving as the original drive isn't a 5400RPM slug.  I could not use my preferred tool (Acronis) to clone it, as it isn't compatible with GPT, but another free utility (Easus) took care of it. I also upgraded the RAM by replacing the single 8GB CAS11 stick with a pair of 8GB CAS9 sticks.

9SIA96K4UK8910,34-321-418,2/15/2016 9:15:13 PM,Robert P.,Great product for the price and for a lower end gaming machine!,5," Biggest Pro by far is the cost, $815 for a laptop with these stats is pretty crazy I didn't believe it until I actually powered it on and checked the System Properties. If you go onto Lenovo's Website and built this exact laptop you will spend $1,130.The product specs that are not listed - Processor has Turbo Boost up to 3.1 Ghz, Bluetooth 4.1/4.0, Fingerprint Reader, 3x USB 3.0, 15.6"" FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS, Anti-Glare, 250 nits, Windows 10 Pro License is included, VGA out, 4 in 1 Card Reader, OneLink, Cat5. Windows 7/10 Pro Recovery Media - The hardrive comes with a partition to create Windows 7 recovery discs. You also should have a slip of paper included with your laptop that will allow you to download or recieve a USB drive through the mail for the Windows 10 recovery media. The Windows 10 is tied to the laptop Serial Number so It most likely can only be used with the laptop.Ram - They were kind and smart enough to give you 1x 8GB stick rather than 2x 4GB allowing you room to immediatley upgrade to 16GB cheaply. You can pickup an extra stick of the same ram for about $40 depending on where you source it from. The particular stick of ram included with my laptop is Samsung M471B1G73EB0-YK0 (8GB 2Rx8 PC3L-12800S-11-13-F3).HDD - 500GB 7200 RPM drive included is pretty quick believe it or not and the nice thing is it can also be easily upgraded to an SSD by removing 3 screws and popping the bottom cover off. I Love that Lenovo is still one of the few companies to build ""traditional"" style cases allowing easy access to the guts.Keyboard - layout is nice IMO, chiclet style keys with a nice rebound. Keyboard has no flex under normal to slighty aggressive typing conditions. Intentionally pressing the middle (G,H area) of the keyboard introduces flex but it requires quite a bit of pressure.Screen - has a very wide viewing angle (I can still see clearly with a slight digression in brightness looking parrallel with the screen), in sun light conditions the screen does have a slight glare but still viewable.Touchpad - Very firm which is nice compared to last years model which was mushy and clanky. It has hidden left/right mouse buttons by clicking either bottom let or bottom right side of touchpad. Multi-Finger gestures such as pinch to zoom, double tap to select, double tap and hold to select and drag.Case Feel and Look - The inner case does not attract fingerprints at all so far from what I can tell, though could possibly change with extended use. The lid does pick up a little finger print but easily wiped away. The lid feels to be a slight rubbery texture but still very smooth.Battery Life - at high perfomance settings averaged about 3 hours with word processing, internet surfing (downloading Far Cry 4) and streaming music from Pandora.Heat - Generally heat is an issue with these mid sized laptops carrying higher end components, this laptop doesn't seem get hot under average multi-tasking conditions, Left side palm area is warm, right side is normal. While gaming I ran Far Cry 4 at full resolution and medium/high settings. I let the entire intro video play up to the point that you gain control of your character, the laptop only got a bit more warmer than while multi tasking Internet and word processing! Audio - Dolby Control panel allows you access to pre-configured Equalizer settings or a full custom Equalizer setting bar. Smart Audio Control panel allows you to change the single multi-jack settings from Headphones, Headset or Microphone while also allowing sound output from laptop speakers and headphones simultaneously. Windows Rating - 5.1 due to Graphics card being on the lower end.", Audio - despite the fact that this is Dolby digital audio the sound quality is not as I expected it. Don't get me wrong it's plenty loud and clear but do not expect surround sound type quality.," ***Gaming - Originally I could not get a game to run but found the reason. If your having problems with games not running at all or not running properly make sure your Intel and AMD drivers are not conflicting with one another. Also make sure if you updated the AMD drivers that you run the AMD cleanup/uninstall tool after to rid the computer of conflicting files. I tested Far Cry 4 at full resolution on lowest settings the game is playable, Fallout 3 seems to run well at full resolution on medium settings, possibly even full settings. Also gave Quake 2 a go and besides not being able to run in widescreen format on the 3.20 patch it runs perfect. A cool feature I found is the left side corner USB doubles as a charge port while the Computer is completely turned off.All in all for the money this laptop IMO is well worth it if your looking for something to play low to medium end games and setup with Quality components.",26,29

One full pound is a big deal when you're backpacking, especially when your reason for purchase was the lower advertised weight.Newegg obtains product details from the manufacturer so perhaps they aren't to blame.

Doing so will wipe out all the included bloatware, which is so severe it bogs down the system to an almost frozen state. I additionally recommend upgrading the HDD and the RAM as soon as possible. If you can only upgrade one, upgrade the HDD. 500 GB 7200 rpm drives are easy to find and inexpensive, and the difference is like night and day. A SSD would be even better. I am much happier with my G50 after upgrading. When upgrading the RAM, make sure you purchase  low voltage compatible sticks, or it will not run correctly.On to the keyboard: Lenovo Accutype keyboards of a certain generation have a tendency towards malfuntion; if a key is not pressed directly in the center, or is not pressed hard enough (even though a click can be heard and felt when pressed) the key will not register. Additionally, some keys will duplicate occasionally. This is a known issue with some keyboards, but Lenovo basically refuses to do anything about it. Others on the internet have sent their laptop in to have the keyboard replaced only to receive it with an equally faulty keyboard installed. This issue has forced me to slow my typing and absolutely pound the keys, which can result in cramps, possibly reduced keyboard life, and can be annoying to anyone around. This may or may not still be an issue on newly manufactured units; I purchased mine around a year ago. On the positive side, they keyboard is large enough to be comfortable to type on, has a very nice full number pad, arrow keys, and the caps lock and num lock keys have indicator lights directly on them. Volume control hotkeys at the top are handy, and though I don't find myself using them much its nice to have the other hotkeys there as well.",None,None

Really good for that tier of laptop. Quad core 2ghz, good GPU because it's a A8.Surprisingly quiet and cool since it's an AMD. They tend to be on the noisy and hot side but it's really nice in my opinion. The processor seem to be placed right on the right of the trackpad, cuz that's where I feel a bit of heat coming out from. The CPU fan is really quiet (surprisingly again). I'm not really greedy when it comes to keybards and trackpads. As long as it works and does what I'm telling it to do it's fine. Yes the shift key on the right side is small, but it's only a matter of time before I don't notice it anymore.Glossy display, it might not be a pro but colors seem to be more vivid, I like the fact that they went with click buttons for right and left trackpad because it is easier to use I guess and it's less of a hassle.  The dvd drive bay is not necessary, but it's a plus and the slim design is really nice. I kinda wish there were usb ports on the back of the laptop but other than that it's ok."," Freeware/bloatware.... Hory shneizer it seemed like the computer came infested with cancer, std, aids and all kinds of diseases. It's incredible the amount of softwares I had to uninstall. It was really make it slow but once you start removing them the computer seem more fluid. I can't really blame them anyways. It's thanks to that that the laptop is cheaper than what it should be. I don't really get the idea of dividing the hard drive into 2 partitions (comes pre-configured in 2 partitions, 1 partition for OS I guess and the other your stuff) but I might just merge it cuz I don't need 2 partitions.I know it's 399, but I kinda wished there was a backlit keyboard.

Turned it off, and then wouldn't boot back into the desktop the next day.  Blue screen of death and then refused to turn on at all.  Lenovo, despite their ""award winning"" warranty, wouldn't cover the repair and then tried to upsell me into a subscription warranty service when they refused to fix it.  They even charge for the phone call, which was not made clear until after I called them.  Also, be aware that they charge $70 for any recovery discs or services, which they require you go through convoluted phone menus to get to (no online options exist).  They then try to upsell you even more ($20/month technical services).  I'm not impressed with Lenovo after this.  They don't include software discs with the laptop and their hardware warranty is apparently really limited.  Newegg customer service passed me off onto them, saying they couldn't do anything (after a sloppy and grammar error ridden quick message - they even managed to spell my name wrong).

For a similar laptop from either Dell or HP, I would have paid twice the price AT LEAST.  The NVIDIA integrated graphics card is more than enough to handle the older games I play on my laptop since I play the larger ones on my tower.The transition between Windows 8's panel mode and traditional mode is seamless and quick, allowing you to quickly get to what you want while still allowing you to use your computer in a familiar way.The addition of a number pad on the keyboard is a little confusing, as the spacing I'm used to for the arrow keys and a much smaller enter button is different, but it's great since the music scoring software I use greatly depends on number pad use for speed, and having a USB number pad was both bulky and frustrating.  It'll just take getting used to!The laptop is incredibly quiet and runs very cool, a great change from my old Inspiron's fan whirring to life every 10 minutes.The laptop includes both VGA AND HDMI ports.  Since I teach and most Smartboard/Promethean products still use VGA cables, this means I won't have to buy an adapter.The webcam, light, and microphone are great, according to my Skype buddies.The computer charges VERY fast.  I'll still have to play around with the energy use settings to find the best setting for battery life, but it seems to last around 3-4 hours with streaming a video."," The speakers, although good, are on the bottom side of the laptop.  This is disappointing, especially if you're consistently putting your laptop in your lap, which muffles the sound dramatically.  When you have it on a flat surface, the sound and projection is great, however.  For the placement, the laptop loses an egg from me--as a musician and an audiophile, good speakers are important.  They are good speakers, but the placement ruins it.  There are so many other places, like alongside or above the keyboard.  Since I haven't opened the laptop up (and probably won't), I don't know if there is internal space for the speakers elsewhere, though, so where they are might have been the only solution.There is no Windows code sticker, documentation, or installation disc included with the laptop."," Fresh out of the box, the laptop was almost completely ready to use for me with the exception of a few programs needing to be installed.  Set up was fast and easy and, contrary to popular belief, it's not that hard to get used to Windows 8 since it allows traditional Windows 7 mode and the switch between modes is incredibly quick.

It's not lightning fast...but, it's totally capable of running the Office stuff, videos and desktop sharing connections I need when traveling. As a diehard Win 7 Pro user, I was expecting my head to explode with Win 8.1. It hasn't happened yet but it took me a few hours of swearing to learn all of the shortcuts and workarounds I needed. 8.1 isn't as horrible as I expected but I am still more comfortable with 7...perhaps that will change over time.I have always hated touchpads on laptops. They were things to disable so you could plug in a real mouse. The touchpad on this unit is much larger than any other I ever used. It has no separate left/right buttons...you simply push down the bottom corners, instead. Like with the OS issue, I am still fond of using a mouse. However, this touchpad seems to be easier and more usable...it's the first one I have not disabled.Overall, the really nice price, the decent quality and  reasonable performance make this a great value for me."," My only real disappointment is with fingerprints. Even the nicely textured case still shows up fingerprints...even when I haven't been eating fried chicken or ribs...honestly. I don't remember fingerprints as an issue with the old, gray/beige cases on 1980s vintage Compaqs.There is a fair amount of free stupidware installed. I call it stupid because I never see anything I would really want to use and I never get any free subscriptions for stuff I do use. There was not an excessive amount, but deleting it is a pain, nonetheless...especially one old antivirus software I won't name which seemed to take forever to delete.", None,2,2

However, it does have an ExpressCard slot.  Being unfamiliar with this port, did some research.  Bought a GMYLE Express USB3.0 Adapter (Dual Port), BC628, card for this slot.  Unfortunately, with only ExpressCard ver 1.0, NOT ver 2.0, usb3.0 speeds not possible (limitation of notebook, not the card). However, sustained reads of 60 MB/s from a usb3.0 flash drive to internal hdd achieved, compared to 26 MB/s from the same flash drive inserted into a usb2.0 port. I can live with a 2.3x speed increase.Card provided sufficient power for an external TOSHIBA Canvio Basics 2TB USB 3.0 Portable Hard Drive (HDTB320XK3CA) without any additional power connections required. Passed temperature and SMART information from this external drive to the notebook (I use hard disk sentinel program to monitor drive temps).  Copying from a usb3.0 flash drive to the Toshiba usb3.0 external drive, both attached to the card, achieved a steady transfer rate of 55 MB/s, compared with 26 MB/s when the flash drive was connected to a usb2.0 port.

You HAVE to remove the ASUS Splendid bloatware in order to get proper colors - this software destroys your colors which is horrible if you're an artist. So make sure to turn it off in order to get a good monitor color display!The keyboard feels nice to type on (more to say about the keyboard in the cons.) Clicky clacky fun.The fan is relatively quiet for me. My old laptop had a broken fan that was sputtering and making annoying noises - so for me this is quiet. I was amazed at how quiet it was when it was rendering my 3D rigid body video. Very peaceful.," The trackpad is irritating! It's too sensitive and overuses kinetic scrolling, making it annoying to scroll. I hate it and there's no option to turn it off. The buttons on the trackpad are horrible - the right button barely works (it'll sometimes left click instead) and I end up having to use double-finger-tap gesture for right click. Sometimes the trackpad or left mouse button won't pick up when I'm tapping on it - like it can't make up its mind between being too sensitive or not sensitive enough.The keyboard layout is infuriating. Take a look at the numpad. They pointlessly squished it for no reason whatsoever. There is a ton of wasted space on both sides of the keyboard - about an inch of space each side. I don't see any logical reason as to why they decided to squash the numpad as if it was an afterthought when they have so much space available.The numpad also has the power button for another pointless unknown reason. The top row goes ""Home"" ""PgUp"" ""PgDown"" ""Power Button."" Where is the ""End"" button you ask? It's toggled by the FN key on numpad 1. Why?!? There's a ton of wasted space to the top of the keyboard that could easily have had the power button. The arrow keys feel very crammed into the keyboard while the right ctrl key has a useless amount of space and the right shift key is very tiny.They decided DARK RED on BLACK is good for the keyboard letters. Again, why?! You can use the keyboard light to light up the letters, but still, this is horrible contrast at a basic level.There's also an annoying bump on the ""W"" key, most likely for those ""mlgpro gamurz"" out there who apparently keep forgetting where their W key is. This will make putting on keyboard stickers difficult (probably not a concern for most, it's still weird.)You know those people who say ""Don't touch my monitor"" when your finger gets close? I never cared on my old laptop, but this laptop is a smudge-magnet. It's disgusting to look at and annoying to clean."," I am not an avid gamer these days, I instead purchased this laptop for 3D modeling, rendering, digital painting, digital sculpting, and game development. It works just fine for these purposes.I did NOT have any of the problems the other users were having - I think those reviews are unfair because some laptops are lemons and you DO have a one year warranty if something goes wrong. My laptop so far has not been showing any signs of hardware problems.For me, battery isn't a huge issue. I'm usually staying in one general area with my laptop for 4+ hours, which means I'd be bringing the charger anyways. So I can't comment on battery life.Remove all the bloatware! Most of it is useless and some just downright ruin the laptop (case and point - ASUS Splendid bloatware ruining the display colors). If something isn't working right try updating the drivers - some of my drivers were out of date.If I had the opportunity to try this laptop out in a store for a good while I wouldn't have bought it.

All in all it's incredibly sleek.This laptop has double the ram of most standard commercial laptops, a humongous 1TB hard drive, and an optical drive for those of us who are required to work with optical media still.This is something that annoys me about other performance laptops is that more of them are ditching optical drives entirely.  Not that you can't just purchase an external USB optical drive, but I consider it a nice-to-have feature in this laptop.It's also nice to know that the laptop comes with a 1-year warranty from ASUS and that includes an accident warranty. Very nice; bigger laptop brands don't normally including the accidental damage warranty.The Processor and the GTX 860m are remarkably powerful for the purpose this laptop will serve (see other thoughts)"," This thing _is_ huge. a bit over 5 lbs. and while you may think that isn't much, for a laptop, it certainly is. I bought this laptop knowing this already, so I can't really deduct anything for it; I knew what I was getting in to.Since it's a performance laptop, you won't be getting great battery life out of it; the battery (thankfully replaceable, unlike other, more expensive aluminum laptops I can think of) is 100% replaceable, but bear in mind it's only a 6-cell L-ION battery. Again, I knew what I was getting in to and can't really deduct eggs for it."," This laptop was meant as a replacement for my wife's rapidly aging dual-core laptop with 3gbs of ram in Total.she does play video games, and she does a lot of work with optical media and would appreciate a system with a massive hard drive. SSD would have been nice, but there's no way you're cramming an SSD, 1TB hdd and an optical drive into a single laptop without it being even bigger and heavier.The bottom line is that I wanted to give her something with reasonable gaming performance, at a reasonable price. ASUS has never failed me in the past, so I found it to be the only logical choice, considering it had everything we were looking for.This laptop is sleek, the screen is nice and huge, and somehow we got it on sale for close to 1k out the door.

After I got my 2nd machine on January 26th 6-7 days later started displaying the same graphic issues,  image distortion and screen flickering at random moments.

The 'refurbished' ones are equipped differently and you can't know what is included until you receive the laptop and discover which options are installed, or which subsystems have had cheaper aftermarket parts substituted during the refurb process. Apparently you will obtain the 'right' to get a free upgrade to Windows 10, if that is your wish. (According to reviewers who report that they got their upgrades to Win 10 without a problem)"," A big feature set is mitigated by a tiny battery pack included (in mine). For some reason I was under the impression that one of the larger, more useful battery packs were specified for this model. Wrong. Mine came with the 2 or 3 cell battery that lasts a little over 3 hours if you limit your use to web-surfing and emails. After barely 2 hours of use the E6430 that I received starts giving me low battery warnings. Really a huge disappointment as I now have to wade through the world of ""replacement batteries"", buy one and install it myself in order to have a usable tool. Since the E6430 is spec'd and marketed as an enterprise/business product it is hard for me to believe that anyone would specify the tiniest battery available for such a computer. A substitution by the refurbisher?"," If you decide to buy one of these you must come to terms with the fact that you won't know what you've bought until you open the box and find out. You may get the ""HD"" screen, or possibly the ""HD+"" if you're lucky. You may get a 3-cell battery, or possibly one of the larger ones which will allow you to use the laptop unplugged for 10-12 hours.Some units have backlit keyboards and some do not. Some have the DVD-RW and some do not. And so forth. One reviewer even got an i7 cpu instead of the i5 that is specified so you may get lucky too. I haven't gone through the machine to verify what has actually been substituted by the refurbisher but I would imagine that there are other subsystems which may have had hardware installed that is not OEM/DELL in origin, and may disappoint some who expect the full compliment of higher spec componants that would normally be found in a business/enterprise model such as the E6430.",1,2

Worked for web browsing, powerpoint, and word processing, which were my primary uses.Once normal HD was replaced with SSD and 2MB ram with 4MB ram, boots up fast and runs smoothly."," Lenovo Tech support is terrible.  I called about a couple keys on the keyboard not working, plus the problem other people have cited of the computer acting like the CTRL key is being held down.  The woman insisted several times ""sir the reason the keys are acting like this is because hackers have already taken over your computer.""  Even after explaining the problem over and over again, the woman insisted.  I let her remote connect to the computer, upon which she insisted she ""found"" viruses, and could clean them up for a measly $200 a year subscription to Lenovo support.

I hung up, and eventually fixed the problem myself.Another time, I needed Lenovo to send me new recovery disks because mine were broken.  After charging me $40, the disks arrived, I installed them, and found out they wouldn't work because they were Windows 8 instead of Windows 7, which Lenovo neglected to check.

Ultimately it ran slowly, and ended up trading her a refurbished dell machine I had just fixed up, that was running perfect. In investigating the slowness, I found the cause to be bad sectors, and judging for other reviews, this may be true for others as well. So I called Lenovo, and got a replacement harddrive sent along with reinstall disks. The computer has a windows 8 pro sticker, with no windows 7 sticker. What this is supposed to mean, is the windows 8 serial is embedded in the motherboard. If it was meant for windows 7 it's supposed to have a COA sticker on the bottom with serial. Turns out the embedded key didn't work with windows 8, so I sent the whole machine in, and I assume they replaced the motherboard. Now the machine runs decently, although you can tell the ultimate limiting factor is the speed of the harddrive,  even more so because of the lack of ram which necessitates accessing the harddrive more often.If you purchase this computer, which isn't bad despite it's flaws, you should be ready and willing to upgrade the harddrive to an SSD, and the ram from 2gb to 4gb or more. Since this has only one ram slot (accessed easily from the bottom, same with HD) a ram upgrade is gonna be more costly then other machines. These two upgrades, with tax, from the web(v300 240gb ssd) costs about $170. Could be a bit more if you need the upgrade kit version of the SSD which comes with stuff to make it easy to transfer your data, which you want to do since the computer has recovery partitions and the OS which you will need.I gave this 4 stars, because I only really consider two things to be deal breakers, in comparison to its benefits. One is the lack of a second ram slot... especially given this is sort of a low income machine, having only one slot is additionally punishing to those who have less to spend. The other is the edges and corners. If you compare this to a dell, even an older one, you can instantly feel the comfort difference that rounded soft edges provides, vs lifting your wrist up to find lines dug into your skin from using this machine. I don't blame Lenovo for the harddrive.Couple of final thoughts;The usb layout is such that there are not two usb slots next to each other, which effects users of external drives that require two usb to be connected. If you care about warranty, and getting good service, you should stay away from the ideapad products, they even tried to charge me shipping to get the computer fixed, which never would happen for a thinkpad customer.

It's a year old hold-over so-to-speak which is why so cheap but guess what? A lot of good specs for the $ and overall very good performance. Of course 2GB of RAM is minimal but you buy it with that in mind - I have a 4G stick of Mushkin 1333 coming (no reason to pay for DDR 1600 as the proc doesn't support it so it will get down-clocked anyway) and planned to from the git-go. Great performance and features on so many other features, especially for a three-bill with free shipping! Forget about serious 3D gaming on this but as a workstation driving a new 1080p led monitor can't be beat and with Win 7 pro pre-installed good luck finding a better value, even the native laptop screen is just gorgeous.

This is a solid tank of a laptop with proven and reliable, if basic, components.  Also, comes with Windows 7!  Always a plus.  Also, all the normally replaceable components are easily accessible via the single large belly hatch in the bottom.  The hatch even has mounted screws, so you can remove the hatch without worrying abut the screws falling out.  (Lenovos are always great to service.  They really design them well.)"," Only 2GB RAM, which is WAY too little to be running this system off of.  Unfortunately, there is NO second memory slot on this machine.  Just the one under the belly hatch.  Nothing under the keyboard, nothing anywhere else that I could find without entirely disassembling the laptop.  So, if there is another RAM slot, it isn't reachable easily."," To Bamafan_n_sc,  There is no second memory slot under the keyboard.  I'm looking at it right now.  Nothing.  Just the ribbon connectors for the keyboard, touchpad and other parts of the system.  No RAM slots.  Also, the keyboard comes off by removing 3 screws, not one.  I suspect you are talking about a different model of laptop, or they have changed the internal layout since you bought yours.

After reading reviews I didn't quite know what to expect since many were split between being either satisfied or unsatisfied with what they received.  I know buying refurbished electronics can be a mixed bag, and you never know how things are really going to go until you open the box, inspect everything, and turn it on to see how well it functions.  Fear not.  The laptop was well packaged.  It included the power brick and cords, which work well.  On first boot you have a choice at startup of selecting Windows 7 or a restore option.  Select ""Windows 7"" so it will completely setup the operating system.  Windows 7 setup went off without a hitch.  The Windows COA key was on a sticker located on the bottom of the laptop.  Your mileage may vary, as some have been discovered inside the battery compartment, too.  Either way, it's a really good idea to write down the key number before you begin the installation and setup process.  And make sure you've written everything down correctly!  Typing-in incorrect product key letters and numbers can be frustrating when you THINK you've typed it in correctly, but you really haven't.  Don't blame the product key, it's likely you who have made the error.The only thing that gave me cause for temporary concern was the wireless antenna, which was not ""on"" even when the switch was set to ""on"".  In case you don't know where it's located, the switch for the wireless antenna is located on the right side of the laptop as it faces you, to the rear of the DVD drive.  Make sure the very tiny switch is pushed toward the rear of the laptop.  Neither the switch, nor its location, are obvious.  I had to download the user's manual from Lenovo's web site before I knew where it was located.  Switched it off and on a couple times and it found my wireless network just fine.  After setting up the wireless network and printer everything else was a snap.  Still have to perform a basic backup, but that shouldn't take long at all.The laptop itself presents very well.  Looking at its physical condition I never would have known it was a refurb.  It looks brand new.  Having a one year warranty takes a load off one's mind, too, given it's used.All in all I would recommend buying one of these to anyone interested in buying a good laptop at a more than reasonable price.  Sure, it isn't brand new with cutting edge components.  However, it should more than fit the bill for using it with MS Office, Skype, Internet browsing, watching DVDs, and light gaming.",3,3

9SIA0AJ16H3553,34-312-811,3/3/2014 11:04:45 AM,Michael S.,"Stylish, powerful, but with a few setbacks",4, 1. Performance is very good for a budget ultrabook.2. Design and build quality are much more than I expected.3. Lots of RAM for multitasking.4. Touch screen is definitely the way to go with Windows 8+," 1. Battery life could be better, 5 hours max is enough for me, but some people need 7 - 10 to be happy.2. I do wish the entire laptop was made from aluminum, the inside of the laptop where the keyboard sits is plastic, minor gripe, but it's a con for me.3. This is a complain I have with every laptop, the HDD is only 5400RPM. With SSDs and 7200RPM drives being common for the past few years, I really wish Lenovo would have made the HDD faster."," Main set of thoughts is presented here.1. Design and Build: Build quality on this ultrabook is excellent, most of the chassis is aluminium, except for the inside of the laptop where the keyboard rests. This gives the laptop a good sense of rigidness and doesn't feel flimsy when picking it up with one hand (don't recommend that). The design is also nice, a lot of people will call it a MacBook clone but that's fine. It looks good and it's that simple.2. Performance and battery life:  This specific U310 comes with an Ivy Bridge i5 clocked @ 1.8GHz which can be boosted up to 2.6GHz via Intel's TurboBoost tehcnology. It also includes 8GBs of RAM, a 500GB HDD @ 5400RPM and a 24GB SSD cache that helps speed up the boot up times. Combine all of these things with Windows 8 (now updated to 8.1 as of Feb 2014), and you have a very solid ultrabook when it comes to performance. It flew through web browsing and office work, as well as more CPU intensive tasks like benchmarks or light gaming. Battery life isn't horrible, but it isn't great either. When you look up the bare minimum specs for a laptop to be considered an ""ultrabook"", this is what you find. While using the 'Balanced' setting inside of Windows; web browsing, playing music inside of iTunes as well as some video watching will grant you around 3 1/2 to 5 hours of battery life. Obviously what you do will determine how long your battery will last. For me this is decent enough that I can take this laptop to school and not need to bring a charger with me. Taking notes and web browsing allow me to eek out a good 5 hours of battery life.3. Gaming performance:If you're looking for a gaming ultrabook, look elsewhere. This laptop has integrated graphics, which means it's not gonna be playing Battlefield or Skyrim at any decent settings. Intel HD 4000 is made to be a power sipper, and isn't made for gaming. I've played games like Portal (any Valve game) and Minecraft, and those both play fine at full-res and at medium settings. If you're looking to play something like Skyrim or Crysis 2, you're gonna be locked into playing at 800x600 res, with bare minimum settings. Light gaming is fine, but nothing hardcore.4. Overall thoughts/ Who is this laptop for?:For the price I paid at the time ($721 out the door) this laptop is excellent. The performance is a good 7/10 when it comes to laptops, the design is thing and light and stylish, the build quality is way above average with the generous use of aluminum instead of plastic, and the battery life, at least for me, is enough to get me through hours of taking notes at school and a little extra afterwards. If you're looking for a gaming computer or powerhouse, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a stylish, compact ultrabook that offers above average performance, battery life and feel, then this might just be for you. From students to people that are always tweeting at the coffee shop while listening to music, this laptop is a very solid",None,None

9SIA0AJ1BU7797,34-246-621,4/19/2013 6:13:16 PM,Adrian T.,Re-Review: OS now on the SSD,3," (Now that the OS is on the SSD, and I've had a little more in-depth experience with the laptop as a whole, I believe a whole new review is reasonable. It's up to Newegg to post it. My older review is under the nickname ""Incubus"".)- Laptop boots up before the Windows symbol can even finish it's animation.- Pretty much anything that involves software installed to the SSD boots up without even having to think about it, snap, just like that.- Light-weight, exceeds in the mobility factor.- LCD is nice and beautiful, everything looks slick and great.- With the disc drive (D:) clear of all OS-related junk, all 465GB are free to fill to my heart's content. Yaay :D"," - Trackpad is still kinda weird, it has this thing I don't like where the LMB and RMB are also touch-sensitive to the cursor. Without practice, clicking around will be seriously annoying in the beginning. Before when I said it was overly-sensitive, that was more of a Chrome issue than anything, I don't have that issue with Mozilla.- I seriously wish I had checked if it had a light-up keyboard before I bought it, this laptop could really use it. And Bluetooth! Oh how I wish it had crossed my mind!- It's a one-piece, no access to the RAM, HDD, and battery. Big slap-in-the-face for those who have experience opening up laptops and messing around.- Don't be fooled by the idea that it has a decent battery life.... it doesn't.....- Graphics integrated into the CPU, gaming even at lowest settings is a pretty lame experience. I've only tried DotA2 so far. Also be sure to never install a game onto the SSD, my friendly advice.- For some reason, when you wake the laptop up, putting in your password stalls for a few rather long seconds. You get over it, but it's still a con. Definitely bites a chunk out of the OS-on-SSD pro, or maybe it has nothing to do with that, no idea.- The bloatware is pretty rancid. I tried to get rid of most, but apparently if I get rid of them all, bad things will happen?Speaking of bloatware, I am afraid to uninstall this ""Lenovo Smart Update"", even though it takes up the MOST memory of all background programs, and I still can't figure out what in the heck it actually does, even when I google it.- Audio is utter trash. Audio drivers are worse. The speakers are whatever, but there's only one plug-in for headphones, and the symbol suggests it'll take headphones with built-in microphones, but no dedicated microphone slot. With typical earbuds, audio is average, but don't you DARE try plugging in professional studio headphones! You've been warned.- It's generally agreed that Windows 7 HP 64bit is max 20gb of space. With a 32gb SSD, I thought I'd have plenty of room for more. But then the updates came and took a bunch of space. I'm left with 2.82gb as I write this (including all other software I installed), so I have to be on watch, cleaning up w/ CCleaner, uninstalling as many useless-looking things as I can. I have to check on the SSD every few hours, because it just changes out of nowhere to a bigger or smaller number, it's ridiculous.- ATTENTION: There are random places on the planet where Wi-Fi is just plain impossible to get. I'm typing this about 50 yards away from a room in the building where the Wi-Fi refuses to connect. Insult to injury, I had a Mac laptop sitting right next to it that connected just fine. Where I am sitting now, it works. Apparently this is an issue with the Wi-Fi card that they worked out last year, started building new models with working Wi-Fi cards, but continued to sell the old models to customers. Apparently I am one of the unfortunates who ended up with one of the old model."," As I mentioned before, I tried to install Windows 7 on the SSD myself. Hint: Don't do it. If you want the OS on the SSD, you have to try to convince Lenovo to do it for you. I managed to, after the hard drive and OS basically bricked and they accepted to do it through warranty, making a faulty hard-drive replacement claim when I explained to them that attempting to re-install the OS through alternatives methods showed no sign of any of my drives, ever, at all. I sent it in, they sent it back.When I got it, the disc drive got bigger (from 420gb to 450gb), but THEY DIDN'T INSTALL THE OS ON THE SSD! Also the folder for the drivers was nowhere to be found, when it was originally what came on the SSD. It was just empty this time, so I assumed I had no drivers. I decided to give up on the OS-SSD thing and I installed the drivers online. Every single one gave me an error message. I called Lenovo, they sent me a set of discs that would re-install everything, OS, drivers, etc. The installation stopped at the second disc, and never continued. Result? No more OS, everything wiped completely.This time I called and raged at them, threatening to find a way to get all of my money back if they didn't fix everything this time, complete with drivers, OS on the SSD, everything to my satisfaction. The first call I made, the entire Lenovo department was ""down"", and the woman I talked to couldn't help me to save her own life. But eventually I ended up on the phone with someone who helped me fix everything, including this little problem where the warranty claimed to end in August, even though I bought it in December, and that error wasn't fixed for MONTHS! I sent it in, they sent it back. And the OS was on the SSD. Glory to the hypno-toad. AND my disc drive went from 450gb to 465gb. Awesome :P Turns out the drivers are all installed in the Program Files folders of the C drive..... Oh well, at least my OS is finally on the SSD.BUT NOW I'm having this Wi-Fi card issue, and I learned online that they acknowledged this issue last year, and were fixing it. I seriously wish I had read this looooong before all of this, and apparently I would be solely to blame for not bringing this up during all these back and forth shipments, but I didn't know, so... blah. NOW I HAVE TO SEND IT IN AGAIN SO THEY CAN FIX THE WI-FI CARD, AND WHO KNOWS WHAT THE HELL ELSE THEY'LL END UP DOING TO IT!!!(I tried to ask if they could give me a Wi-Fi card that goes to 1000Mbps to make up for all I've been through. Apparently it doesn't work like that. Lame.)Bottom line, it's an okay laptop. It's just.... a laptop. I can hardly even call it an Ultrabook. I bought this when it was $750. Then it dropped down to $500 afterwards. Lovely. It's not too hard to figure out why, either. I strongly recommend you not buy it, at all. I don't know much about the U410, but apparently it has the same issues, plus dedicated graphics. Also dropped to $500? Yeah..... keep shopping.",1,1

If you need to clean install an OS like Windows 8, it is recommended to put the installation files on a bootable USB drive.One other note: by default, the storage drives are configured in a RAID setup. When I was trying to install Windows 8, the installer was not able to detect the drives as a result. I had to go to the BIOS and change the storage setup from RAID to AHCI. This will cause bluescreens when trying to load the preloaded installation of Windows but will allow the Windows 8 installer to detect the drives and format accordingly.

See other thoughts. - Trackpad is mediocre, as stated in other reviews.  Make the buttons a separate piece of plastic from the actual touchpad and it wouldn't be so bad... silly Lenovo. And no, this isn't like a Macbook where the whole pad pushes in;  you're literally bending the edge of the plastic pad to click the left and right mouse buttons."," There is a 68-page thread on Lenovo's official forum regarding the Wifi issue.  They refuse to publicly release their fix, which is hardware-based; they insist on having customers send it in.  Even then, many customers who sent it in for service report no improvement in wifi when they get their unit back.  I believe the problem is the antenna design, possibly related to the metal case... it can't be the Wifi card itself, since Intel, Broadcom AND Atheros cards were used and all exhibit poor range and speed issues.My old Lenovo Y550P gets great speed with my Asus RT-AC66U router... however the best this U310 has done is to connect at a link rate of 48Mbps.  Bottlenecks my Comcast blast 50Mbps download speeds to 13Mbps... if I'm right next to the router.  8Mbps in the next room.Note the lowercase ""b"" i'm using... mega-BITS per second.  Not mega-bytes.   13Mbps =  1.63MBps.If you're buying an ultrabook, you likely want to have something you can carry with you and hop on wifi hotspots, etc.  Therefore, bad wifi is kind of a dealbreaker :(  Even at the sub-$500 price I got this for, I'm going to return it.  Disappointing, because aside from Wifi this is a nice little machine.  If you're willing to plug a  $20 3rd-party dongle in one of the USB ports and do it that way, then go for it.  Thi",2,2

Easily an hour of clicking this and that, rebooting the computer, rebooting the router, messing with misc settings and suddenly it works for no reason.Viewing angle is just awful.

This in itself isn't terrible, in fact it's fairly standard -- the issues come when you attempt to get rid of the bloatware and find that the machine becomes tremendously unstable. After cleaning my U310 out of the trash software Lenovo shipped with it, Intel Fast Boot stopped working, then the wifi, and everything associated with it (Widi, etc). I Didn't think this was a huge deal either, just go get the drivers from Lenovo and re-install the hardware which stopped working. Nope, Lenovo is such a crud company that their drivers don't even work. Which means unless you want to tiptoe around the aweful software that comes with the computer, you're going to lose some of your laptops functionality, like wifi (and who needs internet?)Also, if you're planning on installing Windows 8, or upgrading the drive to a full fledged SSD then you're in for a nasty surprise.Windows 8 won't install without tinkering with the partitions, and there's a bug where if you change up the partitions without changing some BIOS settings you can PERMANENTLY LOSE ACCESS to BIOS. Don't believe me? Google it. It's disgusting.If and when you do get Windows 8 installed you'll find that Lenovo's Windows 8 drivers just don't work. I rolled back to Windows 7 because of it. Also, Lenovo's Windows 7 drivers don't work on a fresh install of Windows 7 -- so no wifi until you're at least upgraded to Service Pack one.HDD is ""slim"" -- so you'll have to some surgery to get a 2.5"" SSD in there. Most people probably aren't into that. Through all this, there is NO support from Lenovo whatsoever, they'll simply tell you it's either A) Not their problem, or B) they'll ask you to send it in and so they can get it back to you a month later with all the bloatware put back onto it.DON'T.

But still it works just great.The only points I felt were compromised were the construction under the shell which is plastic unlike the aluminium top and bottom. I guess they had to do it for the price point. But nevertheless it feels sturdy. Battery could have been better. I get around 4-5 hours on normal surfing, word processing and video watching. Overall Lenovo has made a great product for the price and I would recommend this very much indeed. And thanks to Newegg for the timely shipping and also the one year extra warranty provided with the laptop.",2,2

Not an ultrabook *see below., Not for graphically intense gaming.," I got this for my wife to replace a dying HP.As soon as I got it home, I opened it up and took out the hard drive and replaced it with a 120 gig ssd. I loaded windows 7 professional and office as well. I didn't upgrade the ram as she does not need it for now but the 4 gig can be swapped with a single 8 gig. I enabled compression on the ssd (Corsair) since an ssd drive is so fast it does not have nearly the hit that you would have on an optical drive (in this case nearly none). Also, because the seek and load times are so fast, it nearly negates the need for an I-5 processor. This is why the Pro for not being an ultrabook. This has a regular 2.5 inch hard drive and  regular so-ddim ram (not soldered onto the motherboard).  Now she has a very light notebook with no spinning drive and great battery life. It is small and light enough that she can toss it in her book bag with enough battery life that she does not have to pack her charger. It is far lighter than my Think Pad.If you do mostly web surfing and document work and you want something that is very portable with long battery life and don't want to blow the budget, this is a great way to go.",6,8

9SIA0AJ3KD0721,34-317-602,11/26/2015 11:07:56 PM,robert w.,Surprisingly disappointing,2," Price: This laptop is sold at an extremely competitive price (but you get what you pay for).Ports: Includes all the ports you'd expect, including USB 3.0, HDMI, multi-reader (SD/MMC) and headphone ports. Capacity: 1TB hard drive and DVD-RW included.Weight: While not a featherweight, it's a reasonable weight for the size and specs. After carrying around in a backpack all day, you won't be tired."," I have been using this laptop for about 6 months and have grown to hate it. It honestly drives me nuts. There is no one thing, but a combination of little things that will make you loathe pulling this laptop out of your bag and wish you had anything else:- Security: This laptop shipped with a severe security problem in the BIOS. There is a BIOS flash available from the manufacturer, and it's one of the first things you should apply if you buy this laptop.- Windows 8: Every other operating system release from Microsoft is worth a pass. Upgrade to Windows 10. It's free.- I swear the touchpad is drunk. Everything will be going just fine and then suddenly it'll wander off into its own little world and put the cursor only into the general direction where you're pointing it. It's not only an uncomfortable touchpad to use, it's not particularly accurate. I bought a wireless mouse and try to use that wherever possible, because the touchpad is almost impossible to manage.- Performance: For a machine with 10 CPU cores and 8GB of RAM, it's astonishingly sluggish. This may be a problem limited to the AMD-powered model, but a lot of it seems to be limited to the very slow disk drive included with the machine.- Layout: There is a sharp ridge around the edge of the laptop perfectly positioned to painfully catch your wrists. Maybe it's intended to force you to maintain a healthy typing position, but it serves no purpose but to annoy me.- Keyboard: The chiclet style keyboard is hard to avoid on laptops these days, but I type hard and fast (I'm a systems architect) and the keyboard stutters--it sometimes puts the character I type down twice unless I type very softly. Also, the keyboard isn't backlit, and this makes it annoying to use in the dark.- Heat: This laptop gets very hot sitting on your lap. Could be limited to the AMD-powered version, but it's very annoying.- Battery life: Astonishingly poor. You only get about an hour out of it when watching YouTube videos.- WiFi: Outdated 2.4GHz only chipset."," I haven't been either more excited about a technology purchase this year, or more let down after the fact.

We took it out of box and whet thru all the setup and it booted just fine.  I started doing updates for windows and it downloaded and installed 1.5gbs of udates(this took like 3 hours). When that was done it said to restart the computer, so I did.  When I hit the restart button the screen went to saying restarting and it just sat there for 30 mins and I had to press and hole the power button to turn it off.  Turned it back on and it said it was processing updates and not to yurn off the computer.  It got to 99% and said ""unable to apply updates undoing changes do not turn off computer"".  Si I waited for like 45 mins for this to finish and that screen would not go away.  Rebooted and it kept saying the same thing when I rebooted.  Call tech support(if you want to call it that) and the first person I talked to was very rude and eventually he hung up on me(at first thought we got disconnected, but he never called back!). Sooo, I called back and talked to another tech(?) nicer fella tried a couple of things and then did what I didn't want to do, a factory restore.  That went fine and it was back up and running again.  Oh BTW this laptop comes preinstalled with SUPERFISH(If you haven't heard about this just GOOGLE it!!).  Back on point after the restore I did the updates only a few at a time and everything went just fine.  I got all updated and system cleaned of the SUPERFISH (adware/malware). It was working great.  So, by now it's 4am, mind you I've been working on it since noon that same day.  I shut it down and when I get up the lady that bought this(I was just getting it setup for her) said it wasn't working right.  So I turn it on and it boots to the start menu and locks up!!!!  Can't do anything.  Turn it off then back on and it does the same thing!!!"," AVOID at least this model(I do not know about other ones)!  I'd even go as far as saying AVOID this company!  Tech support is a joke, they asked me like 2 questions before saying would you like to return it to us or here at newegg.  Oh and if they said they fixed the SUPERFISH thing, how could it still be on this, every restore from the factory puts it right back on the system!!!!!!  So you have to deal with that EVERYTIME you factory restore!  This is the first and more than likely last time I will buy from this company(Lenovo that is not Newegg, Newegg rocks as always).  I just setup a return for a refund.  Just AVOID!  Wish I would have done a bit more research other than the reveiws on here.

If you want to install a clean copy of Windows 8.1, there's a utility from Microsoft that will download the Windows 8.1 ISO. The product key is built into the bios so all you need to do is burn the ISO and boot from it. From there download the drivers from Lenovo. The full model is Z50-75.2. Don't bother with installing Windows 8 and upgrading to 8.1. It won't work. This was the first thing I tried (I had a copy of Windows 8 lying around). Not only does the upgrade to 8.1 fail every time but the drivers from Lenovo are incompatible with Windows 8. 3. If  you have an issue with the laptop freezing while running off the battery, download and run the bios updater from Lenovo. This fixed the issue for me. 4. Windows 7 installs and runs well on this machine. However, you'll need to change the bios settings to support legacy (non efi) operating systems. 5. Ubuntu 14.10 works perfectly with a fresh install. Wifi, sound, vid card, everything. Ubuntu 14.04 didn't work at all. Couldn't even get it to install.",6,6

Performs snappy in windows 8.1, The A10 never hits its rated specs (1.9ghz base and 3.2 ghz turbo).  During a game of League of Legends it runs at 1400 mhz.  Temps per hwmonitor are 95 cel at idle on windows 8.1 desktop so this is most likely why it does not turbo to the speeds advertised. Newegg wants $68 to RMA a product that does not remotely meet the advertised specs., I had high hopes for this laptop.  The A10 7300 is a nice APU that should be very desirable in a mobile platform.  I'm not sure why this Lenovo performs so poorly but it runs 95 cel in windows.  I could probably open it up and reapply thermal paste and drop temps so it will turbo.

On top of that its cooler and battery life is deifnitly better.  Being cooler its also quieter.  Performance is good.  Mostly capped by the stock harddrive.  I'd upgrade that to a Hybrid or SSD.  RAM is sufficient as I never go above 30% on either RAM or CPU.  The HDD runs at 100% a lot though.  5400 RPMs just isn't enough.  Sufficient to game on low to medium settings no sweat., Battery capacity is small.  It says up to 4 hours but I doubt you ill get that It's only a 4 cell battery.  The optical dirve is not necessary and the lack of a hybrid or SSD drive really caps the computer.  I would have also liked it to be a little lighter.  The touchpad buttons are a hair small due to its angular design., Wish it came with an FX-7500 or a dedicated graphics card.  One of the only Kaveri's around in the USA so not much choice.

9SIA0AJ4RG8000,34-319-675,9/27/2016 9:12:52 AM,Simon T.,"Good product, works as indended.",4," Pros: - Strong, durable, acceptable weight (5lbs i believe), the T420 is a strong model for lenovo thinkpads. If you're unsure what to get, a T420 is usually a good starter.- Fast enough. This computer will perform adequately, but will not blow your mind. It is good as a work computer, but I wish it was a bit faster.- Aesthetic : Lenovo thinkpads are very distinct, they are visually pleasing, nothing too fancy, looks very professional, the keyboard is beautiful, elegant black and red design, it's awesome.- Thinkpad keyboards are generally awesome, they type really well, feel really good, the little center button is AMAZING. I barely use the trackpad with this, it's definitely the distinctive feature of thinkpads. - Price is good, not expensive at all for such a durable computerIn short, this laptop is an amazing work computer. Do not expect to play games with it, as it is not it's intended use. As a bonus, you can get a docking station that makes it easy to transition between laptop and desktop computer."," Cons:- The biggest con is the battery life, it is less than an hour on regular settings. Not power settings or anything but connected to the wifi. This makes it bad for crowded spots such as lecture halls, which often lack electrical outlets, and anywhere that there's a lot of people, really.- The disk tray keeps opening, it's very sensitive. You close it and it'll open right back up. This usually happens 2 or 3 times. Sadly, third party softwares are usually more of a pain than anything. I suggest disabling the disk tray in your settings if you don't (or rarely) use it.- The two lower buttons on the trackpad are pretty useless (read: I don't know what they do aside from click like the top ones) and you might press them by mistake by using the trackpad, I never use them and I was tripping on it at first but it's not that big of a deal."," I definitely reccomend lenovo thinkpads, especially the T series to anyone. They're great laptops, strong, durable and fast enough to do business work or schoolwork on them. I might change mine for a faster model or just replace the HDD with an SSD if I can, maybe processor as well and add ram, I hate waiting for the boot-up (so impatient) !Thank you newegg for letting me buy a refurbished lenovo, it is much easier to buy from newegg than from individual resellers because it's easier to get support if needed, and you have a reference to when and where you bought it, accessible at any time.

The DVD-RW drive has some issues loading disks It came with two 2GB SoDIMMs. It model number isn't in TABook and I only found one reference on the Lenovo website. It has a camera but no fingerprint reader. The tag in the battery compartment says ""Lenovo Singapore"". The bios was the original 1.31. The hard drive and DVD drive were both manufactured in 2011, so they were probably original to this laptop. Now for the good - it's in excellent condition with only minor signs of wear.

Don't hesitate!",4," T420's are well known as the best budget laptop money can buy, and this is the one you want. I don't regret this a bit, the laptop is clean and looks new. Zero dead pixels, pristine screen, even the outer chassis is flawless. Mine is the 1600x900 version, not the 1366x768, so hopefully you'll get lucky as well? I don't know why everyone dogs on this monitor, it's really quite nice for a laptop in this class and price range. Peerless keyboard and trackpad quality. Very easy to upgrade. Quite fast for the age and price point."," Mine only came with a six-cell battery, not the nine-cell that most people seem to have received, which is a disappointment. Also the rubber nubbin for the trackpoint was broken on mine, just the red rubber cover not the actual trackpoint itself. It took me a while to figure out what the issue was, I assumed at first the trackpoint was broken. Actually the rubber nubbin had dried out and cracked all around the part that goes around the actual trackpoint, so the cracks were allowing too much play and ruining the action. Also the charger as some have said is not OEM, but my only complaint on that point is the cable is almost uselessly short (with both cables around 4' long). Nothing really worth complaining about all in all, I'm happy."," I booted to windows 7 as a brief test, and the serial provided validates fine. An mSATA SSD (Transcend 128GB can be found very cheap) is a no brainer upgrade and very easy to install, anyone could do it in seconds. Ram upgrade requires the removal of the keyboard for the second DIMM but this took only one screw and was very easy. Now I've got 16GB of ram and it's running Server 2012 (which I use as my workstation OS) flawlessly. Performance in most applications is great even with the fairly midgrade i5 this comes with.

The keyboard looked new and the trackpad I think is new as the other t420 I've seen had a textured trackpad and this one was smooth. Everything I tried (in the day or so I've had it) has worked fine with one small exception that I'll outline in the cons", Two minor nits are that the power supply is not a Lenovo but is a new no name replacement. This may or may not matter in the long run but I've found that genuine Lenovo power supplies are quite good and have had mixed luck with off brand replacements. The second issue I had was that the right speaker was not working initially. I switched the sound balance all the way to the right to hear if there was any sound coming out at all and turned up the volume. There was a medium pop sound and the right speaker started working. No idea whatsoever why that would be but it is working fine now. Given that it all works now I'm not going to ding the score., What you get for the price seems like a really good deal to me. I got this for a family member for whom this is a big upgrade.  I am concerned about the power supply but will hope for the best.Notes on the Lenovo itself and not this deal:  The resolution of the screen is fine and the coating is not glossy but the contrast is meh. The sound quality is also poor (though working!).  The laptop body seems very solid and the hinges are excellent as I would expect from a Lenovo T series.  The processor is plenty powerful.

For this laptop it took over 5 hours and still no luck.  We ended up hard wired in to get it installed.  Wanting to know just how bad things were I hopped over to one of those d/l test sites and their results showed a splendid .3 MB/sec d/l speed over wifi.  I then wired in and got nearly 18 MB/sec, that's an eighteen not one point eight.Seeing as d/l speeds with a wired connection seemed to be all right I decided to install all the windows updates, I tried this wireless and all I can say is HA!  It would have taken DAYS for the updates to d/l.  However over a wired connection I had all the updates installed in less than 30 minutes.  Immediately after installing all of the MS updates I opened the HP software update program and had it search for new updates.  Seeing as this was 3 months ago I don't recall the update name but whatever it was the file was rather large and it took 20 minutes to d/l using a wired connection.  With all the updates installed it was time to once again test the wifi connection.At this point I headed back to the same website and ran a wired test to see if the results were the same.  For the most part I received the same results +/- a MB.  Next I unplugged the wired connection, waited for the wifi to connect and then tried the test again.  This time the wireless test results showed 15MB/sec a far cry from the .3MB/sec I had just an hour earlier.Seeing as we purchased two of these I had another laptop to test my finds on so that's what I did.  I started by testing the wifi, testing wired before updates and then on to the updates and testing once again.  With the second laptop I got the exact same results as the first.  A horrible wifi connection at the start and a fully functional connection at the end.I think the thing that surprised me the most is that the drivers for the wifi adapter were fully up to date and thus not the problem.  I'm not sure what was in the HP patch(es) but whatever it was the problem was fixed.  We have now owned and used these machines, daily, for over 3 months and have not encountered another issue.  If you have the patients to install all the windows updates and the HP updates then this could be a good machine for you.  I'd wait for the price to drop again as the current cost is a bit higher than we paid.",4,4

9SIA0AJ4YK8572,34-259-735,1/2/2015 9:18:19 AM,Adam L.,Wifi finally fixed!,5," Let me start with the two fixes that worked for me for the wifi:  initially, because of James P's review, I changed the ""bluetooth collaboration"" setting (under the advanced tab of adapter settings) to ""enable"".  That seemed to work for a bit, but it still seemed that after using it for a while the speed would slow back down to barely usable.  I played around with just about every setting in the advanced tab and finally found that changing the ""minimum power consumption"" setting to ""disable"" fixed it!  It's been about a week since that fix and wifi speeds have been great, and while I haven't truly measured it, the battery life does not seem to be affected by the setting change.  (note: I left bluetooth collaboration enabled)Anyways, back to the pros:  Awesome specs for the price!  Great performance, solid build, thin, lightweight (for a 15.6"" laptop), good sound from the built in speakers, decent battery life.  Unlike most laptops these days, it has access panels underneath for the memory, hard drive, wifi card, and also an empty mSATA slot, so no need to remove 25 screws and pull the whole thing apart (usually voiding the warranty) just to upgrade components.  I also really like that the touchpad has separate mouse buttons; I've never really liked the touchpads that a lot of the new laptops have that combine the buttons with the pad to make it one piece.  Also, a big fan of the option to stick with W7 or upgrade to 8.1.  I ended up installing a SSD and decided to try W8.1. This thing now runs faster than anything I've ever owned!  I've been a long time fan of W7 but after using W8.1 for a while (and disabling the silly metro screen) I'm really starting to like it."," Besides the issue with the wifi, which is now resolved, no other cons."," I debated on knocking an egg off because of the wifi problem, but now that the wifi's working, this laptop truly exceeds my expectations.  I have to say though, I am a little disappointed with HP support.  In Steve D's review, it sounds like he spent a couple hours with tech support with no resolution.  This seems to be a very common problem with the wifi and I would think that the manufacturer would want to be all over fixing this otherwise fantastic laptop.  I plan on sending them an email voicing my disappointment and I'd suggest that others do the same.  Also, one quick note for anyone wondering: the screen has a matte finish.  Personally, I prefer this because it all but eliminates glare, but some people don't so I just wanted to mention it.",5,5

Please note that turning off bluetooth collaboration WILL NOT disable bluetooth.  Single band wifi runs on 2.4 GHZ and so does bluetooth.  Collaboration simply reduces the amount of noise/interference created between the two network devices.  This is similar to the interference you get from neighbors running on the same channel as your wifi router/access point.  If you want to keep this active, simply enable the setting.

Does exactly what I need it to do right now. The keyboard feels nice and the screen isn't glossy, which helps in brighter areas. The screen is decently lit on its highest setting. Rather unexpectedly, the trackpad supports multitouch, which is nice. Battery life is decent and the standby time is good as well. I can get about 5-7 hours of battery while doing basic tasks (browsing, office, etc.) with the screen at just above half brightness and the ""balanced"" power mode. The laptop can actually play some very, very old games alright. I have RCT3 and Star Wars EaW installed to an external USB drive."," Storage does not come as advertised. The machine does have 32GB, yes, however, what the manufacturer fails to tell you is that about 12GB of that is reserved for the OS and heaven knows what else on an unchangeable partition that can only be accessed through diskpart. Even then, about 12GB of space total is open when you first get it with all the bloatware installed. Also, the thing literally runs out of space for no reason. After installing office, Netflix, and Spotify, I was completely out of space. I can't even use Windows Update because I'm out of space. Thankfully, I was able to get it up to 600MB, but that's it.The trackpad... the trackpad is just awful. I will be using the laptop and at completely random times, the whole trackpad will just die. When it does die, it literally will not fix unless I close the lid to put the laptop in sleep mode. When I open the lid, the trackpad is just fine. As the trackpad is one of the most basic but important functions of a laptop, this is extremely disappointing. In fact, it died four times in a matter of 30 minutes while I was writing this review. I don't know if this is a driver issue or what, but it's extremely frustrating. Bloatware is another thing, I knew it was going to be there buying a laptop that was so inexpensive, but it took up so much space."," So, in review, overall the laptop does what it needs to. It runs office and can browse the web. However, due to the lack of consistency of basic features such as the trackpad and the inexplicable loss of space, I personally could not recommend this product to anyone. I know it's cheap, but the HP Envy is too, and it's much more solid than this. Personally, I don't think I will buy another PC from Acer.

In no way shape or form should this take place of your primary computer. I am planning on using it as a controller for my Twitch streaming, and perhaps as a writing tool. The keyboard is near fullsize, and while it's not the best keyboard I have used, it's by far not the worst. The trackpad is large too, though right after I started using this machine, it stopped working. It was freezing randomly, but then stopped totally, forcing me to use an external mouse. When I bought the memory I needed yesterday, while I had the computer apart, I reseated the trackpad cable on both ends, and it has fixed it. I have read other reports of this failing, and going so far as soldering in wires to ground it properly. if it fails again, that is what I will do. Anybody who is a computer novice shouldn't have to do this, or even send it in for repair within the first week. That, the missing SATA connector, which costs all of 13 cents (seriously, I looked this up, that's the price I could find for one), and the memory slot on the wrong side of the motherboard, all detract 1 egg. Oh, and the speakers are terrible, but this has Bluetooth, so I can pair my headphones with it.Other than that, this is a great little computer for traveling, if you know it's limitations. It is far superior to the similarly priced (at time of purchase) Asus X205TA, which best buy was selling for $149.99 when I bought this. I got this machine for the same price by using Visa Checkout and getting $10 off, but it appears the regular price is $149.99 without that. It's a great value for the specs, with surprising touches like USB 3, onboard Ethernet which is becoming a rarity on low end hardware.My only other gripe, is the SD card slot isn't spring loaded, and doesn't sit flush like most others, though my MacBook Pro which costs way more is the same way.Also, when you first get this computer, make a image of the drive before you even boot into Windows for the first time. I used clonezilla and 2 flash drives. I'm glad I did, as the first time I attempted the Windows 10 upgrade, it failed, even messing up the recovery partition (windows 10 upgrade seems to delete the partition, as now my drive reports the full 28.4gb, rather than the less than 20.). I restored from clonezilla, and the upgrade worked the second time. Made another image right after that just in case things go south or I wipe it and put Linux on it, so I can easily restore to WIndows 10.So yes, in summery, this is a decent value for the price it is no powerhouse, but it's not unusable for light tasks. Overall this is a must buy if you know how to work around the limitations. And maxing out the RAM at 8gb is for me a need, though Windows was surprisingly responsive even on only 2gb of memory.",1,1

9SIAA784TF1360,34-314-645,8/13/2015 3:59:20 PM,Maximillian L.,Decent hardware with very poor software/firmware choices (review for technical users),2," If you are okay with McAffee, Acer abApps, and other software preinstalled, and are okay with removing it all to make space to upgrade to Windows 10, then the computer looks good, seems sturdy, and runs reasonably fast."," My biggest problem with this computer is that there is a 10GB non-removable recovery partition on the disk, so the internal drive only appears as 20GB in size, and much of that is taken up by the Windows installation. This makes it so that you can't even upgrade to Windows 10 out of the box because there is not enough disk space available. I'm sure you could make enough space if you delete a lot of the bloat/trialware before upgrading, but I still feel deceived by the Newegg listing and the Windows 10 sticker that came on the device.The second problem I had is that there is no way to do a clean install of Windows 8 using the included Windows license, which was a dealbreaker for me since I require a computer that hasn't been touched by 3rd party trialware/bloatware. After learning that I couldn't clean-install Windows 8, I tried installing Ubuntu 15.04 and Linux Mint 17.2, but neither one of them would boot from the internal drive using the UEFI or Legacy boot modes in the BIOS. The BIOS boot modes seem pointless since neither mode will actually allow you to boot into an OS that you install on the internal drive."," I would purchase a more expensive / highly reviewed computer except that I didn't want to spend more than $200. My plan is to get a Chromebook which I know won't come with any bloatware, will let me clean-install the OS, and will run the software I need if I install Crouton.",3,5

Average timing: 15 minutes for the process... 30 minutes to understand instructions thoroughly and collect the required tools.  Enjoy!", Can't complain about the permanently installed battery!,,2,3

Difficult to install other operating systems - couldn't get OpenSUSE 13.2, GhostBSD 4.1, PC-BSD 10, or Mint 16 to install - only Ubuntu 14.04."," Installed a fresh copy of Win8.1 after several failed attempts at removing the recovery partition (which is not removable after creating a recovery USB).  The fresh copy of Win8.1 took up nearly as much room as the original copy + recovery partition, so it really wasn't a solution.  Furthermore, the drivers from Acer's support site didn't work as well as the ones included on the factory install, and the overall feeling of the OS was less responsive on the fresh Win8.1 install - so I opted to reinstall the original OS from the recovery USB and have been happy with it, despite the lack of room on the eMMC.  The way I found around the storage limitations has been through getting a Sandisk Ultra Fit 64GB USB 3.0 drive, which has faster read/write speeds than the internal drive, and relocate the program files / (x86) directories to it via the registry.  It sits close enough to the case of the laptop that it can travel installed without fear of being pried off like a conventionally-sized USB flash drive.  Of course, this means there is only one USB 2.0 port left, but I do not use USB peripherals often, so I don't really mind.For around $200, this laptop truly is a great value.",8,8

You can carry it around with one hand and you don't feel like you're going to drop it.Battery life.  I streamed live Flash video on full screen brightness for over 6 hours and still had a 25% charge left.  It only takes about 3 hours to fully charge when it's not running.Boots up in about 15 seconds from the off position after you get all the Windows updates installed.Runs cool and quiet since it has no fan or mechanical hard drive.Speakers are loud and clear.The keyboard is almost full size and not bad to type on., Limited storage.  13GB was available on first startup.  All the Windows updates quickly ate into that.  Also you can't remove the recovery partition for 10GB of additional storage after backing it up to USB.  People are saying it won't boot up without that partition.Screen.  It only looks good at just the perfect angle.  If you move your head up or down or side to side the screen washes out or goes black.  Even at the best angle the colors look washed out to me compared to my 6 year old netbook.  At least it's matte and not glossy.Has an empty bay that could accept an SSD drive but it doesn't have a connection to the mother board so the hard drive is not upgradeable.    Touchpad takes some getting used too.  I turned off the delay which seems to help.  It doesn't have the three finger back or forward swipe my old netbook had and I miss that when surfing the web.  Windows 8 gestures are supported though., I did have an issue with the touchpad locking up.  It seemed to happen after I was streaming video at full screen for an extended time.  The first time a few reboots fixed it but the second time it didn’t.  I plugged in a USB mouse and upgraded the BIOS from V1.03 to V1.08 and so far so good.

It is very capable of doing what I need it to do. The battery life is pretty good. The track pad motions with Windows 8 makes it very convenient even if you're not using a mouse. It is cheap for what it can do."," Low storage space - you can't install much on this notebook. With only 32GB on the drive, you will only be able to install 2 or 3 applications. I only have Chrome, MS Office, and Eclipse and I have 2GB left. It is really only good for light users who don't need much storage.Also, the 2 USB ports are so close together that it is hard to squeeze my USB drive and my mouse receiver in at the same time.

Battery life seems good."," After (55) Win8 updates, about 11.5 gigs available on 'SSD'.

This one is a small laptop style with separate power cord, but its the clunky 3 conductor grounded.  Don't know why they can't just settle on a simple 2 prong design like my Aspire 756.

Kind of gross, and it gave me intermittent connections in one USB port until I dug in there with a tiny brush and cleaned it out."," Lenovo T-series laptops are awesome, and this was one of the last T-series laptops made with the older-style professional style screens.  All the newer ones after this have a wider/shorter screen aspect ratio, which is fine if you're using your business laptop for wasting time instead of working, but it isn't nearly as useful for doing actual work since you have to scroll up and down a lot more.  So I love the T410 screen format.  I also have a T420s and I've found this T410 to be almost as fast and actually more useable due to the better screen aspect ratio.",1,1

Not only is it a new, refurb-licensed Win 7 Pro installation with no bloatware, but every millimeter of the computer is spotless and looks brand new.The only sign of use at all was a little bit of grime INSIDE the edge of the hard drive compartment when I opened it up to try an SSD in it. That's good, though - it proves that US Micro did what refurbishers always should do but most don't: they cleaned up the product so it looks brand new even though it obviously isn't.Even the fingerprint reader (which the spec didn't mention so may not be on every unit) was immaculate, and something you have to rub your finger across is going to get the most crud of all. I've never had a laptop with a fingerprint reader, so it was a nice surprise, and I love it. Mine also has a white LED in the top edge of the display frame that shines down on the keyboard if you need it, which is a nice feature.My last ThinkPad was in the mid 90s, long before IBM sold their PC lines to Lenovo. It had about a 10-inch display, was about two inches thick, weighed about 10 pounds and had ONLY the mid-keyboard ThinkPoint ""pencil eraser"" pointing device (which I still hate, but which ThinkPads still have, although in an improved form) - no touchpad. People who talk about how antiquated THIS laptop is don't know what they missed.The build quality is at least as good as it was on the old one. The spectacular way Lenovo took over IBM's PC business without dropping quality AT ALL should quiet the whiners who complain about ""Made in China"" as if it's synonymous with ""toxic junk"". When I was younger, ""Made in Japan"" meant ""junk"", and look how much THAT has changed. The Chinese are catching up fast, and in another decade or so people who whined about Chinese quality will sound just as crazy as somebody complaining about Japanese quality would sound now.", none," A fantastic deal.

Only thing that looks used was a slightly worn velcro wrap on the power cord.  Operates equally well, fast, clean and screen is clear and crisp as new.

This dual core Intel Core i5 4210u has good performance. it's as about as fast as my 4 year old Intel  Core i7 840QM that has 4 cores! Amazing how far cpu technology has gotten in just 4 years when a dual core can perform as well as a quad core just a few generations old. The Battery life on this cpu is very good and this laptop comes with a 6 cell battery to boot, where many laptops in this price range only come with a 4 cell battery.The laptop is thin and light weight as well which is always a plus if you use your laptop on the go often.This laptop doesn't come with a Disc drive, but there is a slot to put one in, if you so choose which is nice. I myself, hardly use a disc drive anymore, so it isn't a big deal to me.The only drawback to this laptop is accessing the ram and hard drive if you want to upgrade those or replacing the battery once it dies. In order to upgrade or replace these components, you have to disassemble the laptop to get to those components. But many laptops in this price range seem to be like that. I just looked at a few HPs, Lenovos and Asus laptops  around the same price range as this Acer laptop and those  too had no easy access ports at the bottom panel to get to those components either without having to disassemble them first, which seems like the norm in this price range.All and all it's a good deal. for people just wanting something that is light weight good on battery life and has a  good amount of processing power to handle typical everyday use with ease and then some, for sometime to come.",3,3

There is no small access panel, and I found a teardown online, this thing has to be almost completely disassembled and the mother board removed to upgrade the RAM."," Don't buy this even if it is on sale like when I bought it.  It is really cheap for an I5 system, but the trackpad is awful, the wifi randomly disconnects even if you have the latest driver as of this review 7/27/14, and it is too difficult to upgrade the ram or HD on this model.  I am not a picky person, but I can not recommend this product at any price.  Maybe if they get a better wifi driver someday, but stay away until the reviews get better.",2,3

Perhaps it's the Windows 8.1, or the other pre-installed programs that slow down the computer. Wifi also  automatically disconnects every hour (no other laptop does this in the household). Not sure if a hardware or software problem.", Going to re-install my own version of Windows 8 on this laptop to get rid of the additional software.

There are no access doors on the bottom and can find no info on dis-assembly so that the memory can be upgraded.I would also like to eventually upgrade to a SSD drive but looks to be almost impossible to get to the hard drive and memory., Would probably not have ordered this laptop if I had known there was no access covers on the bottom.,5,11
9SIA4RR32K9672,34-319-227,10/2/2016 11:27:34 AM,Wolfgang C.,"Excellent, powerful laptop",5," This is an extremely well-engineered and fairly powerful laptop.  The i5 seems to be a bit faster than its stated 2.5 GHz, and the other hardware specs are similarly good.  The ThinkPad reputation for solid construction is well represented here: from the battery to the touchpad, this machine is built like a tank.  Cooling seems to have been handled well—even at high load the CPU fan is nearly silent.Refurbish quality was excellent: the laptop was pristine, and the charger showed signs of light use at most.  All USB ports work.  The battery was in perfect condition and charged to 100%.  At $200, this was a remarkable deal and completely shames any new similarly-priced box."," While the engineering is very good, the T420 is certainly ugly.  The 1366x768 display and integrated Intel graphics/audio hardware will (obviously) not be good enough for graphics or audio-intense applications.There is no numpad, and the ThinkPad keyboard layout (e.g. the position of left Ctrl) is idiosyncratic.Refurbished boxes are a bit of a gamble."," The T420 is really the anti-Mac: for raw power, engineering and value for money, this is unbeatable.  For style above everything, you know where to go.Some users have complained about the (non-solid) HDD and “low” amount of RAM.  These complaints seem to be motivated mostly by fashion.  4 GB of RAM and 300 GiB HDD is still quite a lot of space, and I recommend careful testing of the bottlenecks in your applications before deciding that you _need_ to buy an SSD.This is an excellent Linux box.  Everything is well-supported, although Intel Centrino wireless cards (iwlwifi driver) can require some tweaking.",None,None

It's a solid build for use in rugged environment. I also was able to snag it up for just under two Franklins. Given the original price for these units they are worth every penny. The I-5 processor seems to work fast and 4 GB RAM is adequate for most applications. It does have an express card slot, a Display port (you may need an adapter to go to HDMI or DVI), and an ""always ON"" USB connector at the backside, which can be used to charge peripherals such as your phone with the laptop powered down (will draw from the battery if not plugged in. With AC connected you will need to configure the port in Power Management to provide the Always On function, though)."," Not really a con, but don't expect an overly fancy laptop. These are designed as workhorses for industrial environments, not for gaming. USB 3 is missing, but then again, the model was released in early 2011, at which point USB 3 was available only in a handful of computers or laptops. If you really need USB 3 you can find an expess card here at Newegg (i.e. Part # N82E16839158048)."," Startup was without major issues. Initial activation failed, even though I did put in the proper sequence from the sticker under the battery. This was resolved by going to Control Panel > System and Security > System and reentering the product code again a the bottom of the page (""Change Product Key"" option). This time it went through without problem.I have been using Thinkpads pretty much since the T series started (me with a T-21) and have never been disappointed. They are rugged devices. This one will be used for machine programming (PLCs and Interfaces) in a R&D and production environment, so ruggedness was more important to me than every bell and whistle.",5,6

I do like the 34mm express card and overall seems to be very functional computer.  this laptop has the ability to run multiple operation systems at once (if you install more RAM).  which brings me to the negative., the RAM is 2 X 2Gb sticks which is fine if you have no intention of upgrading.  it would have been nice to know this fact prior to buying two with the intent of putting 8Gb in one and 16Gb in the other.  now in order to upgrade I have to shelf the 8Gb of RAM instead of being able to use it.  HUGE DRAWBACK!!!!  I tried to cancel order and was unable to after finding this out.  Newegg had order processed and shipped before I could back out (within 4 hours).  tried to cancel order about noon and made purchase around 8:00am.," besides the RAM issue there is also the drawback of the display.  the resolution leaves something to be wanted; however, this can be alleviated by connecting an external monitor.  if you must have a decent resolution you might want a different laptop.",1,4
9SIA4RR32K9672,34-319-227,12/7/2015 5:43:41 PM,Patrick K.,A Great Starting Point to Power,5," Performs nearly as well as a desktop, I notice very little if any loss of speed compared to the overclocked AMD FX-6300 tower I bought this as a less space heatery, more portable replacement for.Virtually trouble-free compatibility with Linux (just remember if you run Debian you'll ideally want to install with an Ethernet cable as you need the binary wifi firmware from the non-free repo in order to get the wireless going).This unit came with the dual band 802.11n Intel wireless, the best available compatible Wi-Fi card.It is a very maintainable and upgradable laptop, unlike so many these days where so much is hard integrated that upgrades are impossible and one failed part means you throw away the whole PC. Nearly every part can be replaced, and Lenovo even makes the maintenance manual freely available on their website, so you don't even need access to hidden proprietary information to upgrade or repair."," 4GB is not much RAM these days, also unfortunately both RAM slots ship populated so you will have to ditch one or both of the included sticks in order to upgrade.As with most Lenovo laptops the internal Wi-Fi card is subject to whitelist restrictions so upgrade options are limited; most particularly if you want 802.11ac you'll need a USB dongle (if you attempt to use an internal Wi-Fi card that is not Lenovo approved for the T420, the laptop will error and won't boot until you remove it; the fastest approved card is the Intel 802.11n dual band unit mentioned above).As a refurbished unit, the battery is quite likely to be significantly aged; this was the case for my unit (47% of original maximum capacity).The BIOS will not boot GPT drives in legacy boot mode. (This is only a concern for Linux users as Windows is unable to boot this combination anyway.)"," All in all it's a great starting package if you want a laptop with serious power, and especially if you would like to run Linux. Grab a couple of 8GB SODIMMs and a nice 2.5"" SSD (best to make sure it's either 9.5mm tall or has a spacer, as the included HDD is a 9.5mm unit and therefore the mounting caddy ships with the rubber rails for that size drive; a 7mm SSD without spacer will fit a little loosely unless you buy 7mm mounting rails separately) and you may find you don't even need a desktop anymore unless you do something that calls for a beefy graphics card.",2,3

The Celeron is Sandy Bridge based, so you're not exactly settling when it comes to CPU power.

(Brightness and volume, for example)Steam for Linux runs well, with some tweaks you can easily get 40-70fps in TF2. More complex maps and maps with higher player limits will cause framerates to drop, obviously. Minecraft gets a very solid 30-40fps. Plays Youtube 720 streams fluidly.

9SIA0AJ1JG9955,34-215-914,3/19/2013 2:15:42 PM,Paul G.,Great deal for the money with high upgradability,5, Price - at $200 you really can't beat the price/performance ratio.  with a 320gb hard drive (albeit 5400RPM) and a Sandy Bridge Dual Core Processor this psudo netbook has some pretty good specs.Up-gradable - The Acer C7 has 2 ram slots so although it only comes with 2gb ram built it I was able to immediately upgrade to 4 by cannibalizing   an old system.  The C7 benefits greatly from easy upgrades like adding an SSD and even more ram (I believe it can take 16gb although that is probably overkill)Software Flexibility - In addition to Chrome OS which I personally like a lot you can also install Ubunti 12.10 on the C7 with relative ease for a more complete desktop experience.  Ubuntu coupled with an SSD and a ram upgrade makes this a complete laptop experience that is very portable and very cheap., Build Quality - Its not a big deal for such an inexpensive device but the build is cheap.  Basically all plastic and it does not feel very sturdy although the look of the C7 is actually not bad., After a ram and SSD upgrade which was less than $100 the Acer C7 is a solid dualboot choice and can run every application I need it to.  The extra speed not only makes it a full-fledged Ubuntu powered laptop but it can even run games such as Counter-Strike Source under steam for linux.  If you're considering an inexpensive laptop or tablet I would highly recommend this product for portable productivity and even some light gaming.,3,3

9SIA0AJ1JG9955,34-215-914,2/1/2013 9:56:58 AM,Anonymous,Delightful Little Netbook,5," I had purchased the Samsung XE303C12 for relatives during Christmas but prefer this Acer.  It is stouter and more squat than the Samsung but appearances are not everything.  The Acer has an extra USB port, 3 total; an Ethernet port; a VGA port and a Kensington lock slot.  The newer solid state drive sounds appealing but with 16 gigabytes, one will need the extra storage with Google Drive.  I am not that comfortable storing information on the cloud.  The Acer's 320 gigabytes hard drive would seem a safer place for file storage.  Acer weighs 0.72 lbs. more but it is a lot lighter than my 6 lbs. laptop.  The battery time is 2 hours less but with a higher capacity battery down the line, it should be comparable.  Getting to the battery compartment on the Samsung does not appear to be as easy as with the Acer.  Acer included a Quick Guide book and Google has a nice help menu, some of it interactive as with the touchpad techniques.  This is superior to Windows 8 wherein one has to fend for oneself.The Chrome operating system is a lot cleaner and more elegant  than Windows.  I understand that a dual boot with Ubuntu can be accomplished on the Acer.  It boots up by opening the lid and goes into sleep mode by closing the lid for times when one has to quickly stop.  Built-in anti-virus and automatic updates are huge advantages.  Recovery with a flash drive seems rather straightforward and simple, unlike the often harrowing experience with a Windows re-installation.With the $49 savings, a Rosewill external DVD drive and a mint colored skin from Decalrus, to dress up the little netbook, were purchased.", Google Cloud Print is the only thing that is not very elegant.  It should not be that difficult to enable a direct connection to a printer that is in the same location. Very round-about way to print., Very pleased with Newegg's service.

It performs each of these tasks according to my expectations.I also use it when a friend needs access to the internet by switching to the guest account. I love how I never need to worry about my friends messing up my machine or somehow accidentally deleting any of my data since it is associated with my account.This also plays the Chrome version of Bastion quite well, though I would suggest plugging in a USB mouse as the track pad isn't good for gaming.I bought it for $199 and that is about the right price for a chromebook. I've been watching the chromebook line for a while now, and almost broke down and bought the $249 arm chromebook from Samsung, but settled on this one for the lower price. The arm chromebook doesn't have a fan and consumes less power, meaning that it runs quieter and has a longer lasting battery."," The HDMI doesn't full screen as I expect at least for Hulu. Maybe I don't have the configuration quite right, but it is a slight annoyance.The trackpad is better than some windows laptops, but nowhere near as good as my macbook trackpad. It's good enough to use, but only barely coming from a mac.

However, this is enough for my use cases.Don't get this machine if you need a full-fledge operating system.Do get this machine if you just spend your time on the web and doing things that could be done with google docs.

This is how they achieved such a low price point. Flimsy through and through.- the plastic around it is flimsy and very frail. When removing the ""1080p"" sticker by the monitor, just the force of pulling on the sticker was enough to make the plastic bend completely off of the screen- whole thing feels hollow and using the keyboard really reflects this with each strike of the keys. This laptop was replacing a 7-year-old HP DV6 that was just a delight to type on. The keyboard on this Acer Aspire is very uncomfortable by comparison.and has an unpleasant feedback when typing. - the screen is easily the worst part about this. Atrocious viewing angles and has a general ""fuzz"" on the image it produces. Colors are also dull and ugly. Just totally offensive to the eyes and has TONS of ghosting. Screen in uncalibrated out of the box and you must do this yourself or the screen will have a very yellow/green tint to it. Also it's set to use the Intel display adapter by default and you must do some work to get the nvidia card to be the default display adapter. - comes with Windows 10 which, by itself, is not a terrible thing but the way it comes on the machine causes it to run VERY slowly. Even slower than my 7-year-old, Windows 7 2.1ghz C2D laptop. The disk usage was always at 100% and I was forced to disable a ton of background processes to get it to run fairly normally. Installed Ubuntu on it which I now use instead of Windows and this has far, far better performance.  Win 10 is just not a good choice of operating system for this machine with all its bloat, telemetry and intolerably long updates (on of the major updates took in excess of TWO HOURS).-The battery doesn't last too long, even when the machine is completely turned off.  It drained to near empty after 7 days off in the bag-940MX is kinda terrible. Haven't tried using this for video games but if you do 3D modelling as a hobbyist, 940MX CUDA cores are not actually usable for boosting application performance so you're stuck using the 7200U which leaves much to be desired."," It seems like there are a lot of negatives, and there are, but these are all entirely offset by the price of the machine which is unbeatable. Getting the amount of power that you do from this price is fantastic. Just understand that in order to get this kind of utility, there are major sacrifices to build quality.Other ""Other Thoughts"": If you plan on using Win 10, you may benefit from investing in a SSD to run the OS from. Running Win 10 from the stock HDD renders the system extremely sluggish. Also highly suggest keeping a bootable Linux distro for when Win 10 inevitably drives you completely insane.",2,6

N82E16834315713,34-315-713,1/14/2017 3:04:39 AM,Richard W.,Exactly what I was looking for...,5, - Dedicated graphics (I don't use this for gaming)- Good processor & RAM at the price-point- Easy to upgrade!- Number pad is welcome addition coming from my old Aspire AS1410- Simple design w/ no gimmicks," - Advertised battery life is not stellar (wasn't a major criteria for me)- Bezel around screen is a bit flimsy, optical drive blank-off a little loose, plastic attracts fingerprints, etc.  - Backlit keyboard would have been nice"," I'm not a gamer or a power-user, but I am coming from a 7yr old Aspire that has an 11"" screen, Core2 solo processor, and 3GB of RAM running 32bit Vista.  That computer has served its purpose well (portability, use it primarily to calibrate/datalog my cars) but it just can't keep up with the demands of modern home/office usage.  Given that I paid $250 for it back in '09 I'd say I'm continuing to get my money's worth.When I was shopping for the replacement I knew I wanted dedicated graphics to lighten the load on the system.  Casting off the shackles of the 32bit OS, and given how inexpensive memory is these days, I wanted a lot of RAM or the ability to upgrade as time went on.  I also knew I wanted to run the OS on an SSD and use a large HDD for data storage.  That being said, I really didn't want to break the bank and fall into my old habit of buying way more than was needed to get the job done.When I stumbled across the E5-575G-55KK I was very happy to find out that it had the M.2 port, an extra memory slot, and even an optical drive bay that I could use to add another HDD if necessary (I have an external DVD-R).  You can also get this laptop from Acer with the 250GB SSD & 1TB HDD combo (they bump up the processor to the 2.7GHz i7) but it's less expensive to DIY.  To further confound things, I also considered the 17.3"" version with the 2.5GHz i5 and a 250GB SSD, to which you could add a 1TB HDD and end up <$50 more than this one (after adding the SSD).In the end I am very happy I went with the 15.6""; it is more than big enough for comfortable viewing.  The viewing angle isn't great, but that's not an issue for the way I use it.  The matte screen is a nice change.  I can have my back to the windows without a ton of glare on the screen.I purchased a Samsung EVO 850 M.2 2280 250GB SATAIII drive and a stick of Kingston 8GB DDR4 2133MHz.  Flip the laptop over, remove 3 small screws that secure the access cover, install the drive and memory, and put the cover back on.  Probably takes 3 minutes if you are taking your time.  Installed Win10 Home on the SSD from a USB, formatted the HDD, and we are in business.  The computer is very fast with the SSD, a drastic improvement over booting from the HDD. Eventually I may bump up the RAM to 2x16GB but for now this is more than enough for what I need.  The only other comment I'll make on the RAM is it looks like my computer came with Kingston 8GB DDR4 2400MHz.  I had purchased the 2133MHz based on what I'd read here, ignoring the advice to wait and see.  Could have saved $2 and got the faster memory if I had had the patience!  That being said there is probably zero practical difference between the two.All in all I'm very happy with the purchase!",4,4

I got mine during a Black Friday Sale so I got a really good deal. The i5 processor is very fast and the 8 GB of DDR4 RAM is great as well. I actually went ahead a purchased another 4GB of RAM and installed into the extra slot opening to give it a total of 12 GB. One thing that sold me on this was the 2GB NVIDIA video card that it comes with. I get tired of laptops coming with cheap built in video cards. This is a nice video card because you can actually play some recent games on this. I've been completely happy with this laptop after using it for about a week now."," The screen is 1080p which is nice, but it won't blow your socks off. I will call it average.

Super fast after using Microsoft's Windows media creation tool to install a fresh copy of Windows 10 (without any of the bloatware) from a flash drive to an SSD. Has Gigabit Ethernet."," The preinstalled Windows 10 has some bloatware and seemed sluggish, but I only used it for about an hour total before installing an SSD, so it might perform better after getting caught up on Windows updates and uninstalling unnecessary programs."," This isn't my primary computer and I haven't done much other than browsing the Internet and using basic office programs, but it works exceptionally well for those use cases. Early on I did have some issues installing updates and the computer locked up a couple of times, but now that all of the updates are installed, those problems have disappeared and everything seems to be working great.

There is no feedback when using the trackpad. Trackpad can sometimes be too sensitive; catches my palms if they're a bit too close to the pad itself. Default display settings are a little wonky and hard to get used to. Playing around with the color and saturation fixes this."," For a $450 laptop, some minor inconveniences are totally acceptable.

Unfortunately, this ultrabook had everything we were looking for, and once we figured out how to customize Windows 8, it was a joy to use—for about one month.Then—again, just one month after we bought it—we woke up one morning to find the screen completely jacked. There was a tiny mark in the upper lefthand corner, and it rendered the whole machine completely unusable. It looked like it was in a constant state of seizure.But nothing had happened to the machine. Nothing had hit it. The lid was not closed harshly. I repeat: Nothing happened to it. So what happened?A little Googling on my Mac showed that we were far from the only customers with this complaint. We found message boards replete with invectives against ASUS for selling and refusing to replace their shoddy merchandise. Some customers even talked about a class-action lawsuit.Dealing with ASUS was like pulling lint from dried super glue. They refused to refund the purchase, and they told us that they could not replace or fix screens. No kidding, right? They have a strict no-screen repair policy! What?!We fought back, and they eventually compromised: They would agree to fix it if we paid to ship the computer to them. There was a catch, however: If they could *claim* that any damage came to the machine en route, they would blame the damage on the shipping since they never believed their screen had a problem in the first place. (Meaning, they were accusing us of making up the story.)They kept the machine for two weeks and finally sent it back. It looked great. With our fingers crossed, we rejoiced that my wife had her machine back. Well, that only lasted two days.Indeed. On the third day—WHILE WE WERE USING THE STUPID THING—the screen went completely ballistic. It was displaying up to three desktops at once; every object on the screen rapidly shifted, sputtered, and faded; and all the colors turned into technicolor snow.We called them back and ran into the same static. This time, after a bunch of haggling, they agreed to take the machine back and fix it AGAIN. They have now had the machine for another two weeks, and we can't even get a hold of them. FedEx says it was delivered just fine, but ASUS won't respond to our emails.All we wanted to do was get our money back for this horrible purchase, but ASUS is greedily holding onto their precious $600.

I was happy before but I just put a SSD in it and the process was smoother than expected.  The laptop has a tiny dedicated BIOS boot button instead of mashing function keys hoping you hit the correct boot option key which is frustratingly not standardized.  This may be something that only makes a difference 5-6 times throughout the lifespan of a laptop but it is Lenovo's attention to stern functionality in this case that made my night yesterday.Despite coming preloaded with windows 8.1, Lenovo had drivers available for 7 through 10 which allowed me to install off an old 7 pro DVD and upgrade to 10, the whole process only took about 2-3 hours including finding and installing the WiFi driver to get things going.Besides these functions the design is sleek and clean.  The keyboard size and layout is more comfortable than any(laptop) I have used before and it has tiny LED's for Caps/Shift lock to let you know when they're on which is another amenity you didn't know you cared about until you don't have it.I spent several months shopping around before I decided on this laptop.  At this price point, I would call it unrivaled."," The DVD drive made a lot of noise but I specifically bought a laptop with a disc drive to make sure installing a different OS would be easy.It doesn't have a dedicated graphics card which is why it doesn't cost $200 more.  I've played WoW, Diablo 3, Skyrim, Fallout 3, and Heroes of the Storm without any problem.  Obviously settings need to be kept low but this isn't a gaming laptop.", On a fresh 7 install none of the networking or USB ports worked so make sure you have drivers on a DVD.I have suggested this laptop to several people and prefer it to my work HP that cost 2x as much.,None,None
9SIAAVC49D8239,34-318-466,1/7/2016 9:55:27 AM,Christopher S.,Pros and cons,3," The price, for one. I got this for $389 from Newegg and for the price, it's pretty solid.Very upgradable and requires very little work to do so. I was able to put 16gigs DDR3 + a Samsung SSD in this thing out of the box and it took about two minutes. The upgraded version runs Linux Mint blazingly fast, and even before upgrade, my one-time bootup of Win10 wasn't _terribly_ slow.Graphics ability is good. Even though it isn't a dedicated card, HD5500 doesn't slow down even a little on playback, etc. Very decent.Comes with a DVD drive, which is a rarity these days. Screen brightness is okay compared to my (2010-era) laptop. It's tremendously light. It's not an ultrabook, obviously, so the lightness is because of cheaply-made plastic yuckyness (see cons below). Even so, it's light."," There are tons of cons about this machine that started rearing their heads once it was no longer returnable. I typically ignore ""usual cons"" (screen resolution, slow HDD...) on machines that are this cheap but these are ""beyond low-quality"".The biggest problem is the extremely flimsy, low-quality case. I expected super-flimsy for the price and even I was surprised at how cheap it felt. That alone would have been fine, but a few months later, the internal plastic that holds the screen mount screws into place broke off completely. Picture this: There was no way to put the two back case screws in because of the break, so every time I opened/closed the screen, the back of the case would separate so that the guts of the machine were exposed. After taking it apart and inspecting, I realized I had to buy a new bottom case cover + wristpad. Got 'em used on a popular online auction site for ~$50 and after totally rebuilding the thing + spending $40, got it back to functioning fine.Then, the flimsy membrane keyboard broke; a key fell out randomly. Another trip to the auction site, another $20 and it works fine. It was a cheap fix that took a bit of time, and if you're not hardware savvy, it may have been a bummer. I didn't mind too much.Now, it's starting shocking me whenever I lift it by the front right of the case (earphone jack area). I'd say that I get a small electric jolt ~50% of the time I lift it there. I'm not too thrilled about that.The trackpad randomly stops working and it only starts working again when I stop using it and (seriously...) blow on it, so it's as if there's dust there but there's not. Also, since I changed the palm rest, this is an entirely new trackpad and still, the problem persists. I'm assuming it's some sort of electrical issue.Other small things:   * Randomly runs hot, even when idling   * Doesn't behave well with Linux hibernate functionality.   * Wifi is about 50% slower than that of a ~700 Acer. To be expected, I guess, and given     that Lenovo blacklists nearly every Wifi card on the market, not one that's worth fixing     for me personally. FWIW: It's still very capable. I get ~50Mbps (on connections where the     Acer gets ~110-120), so quickness is still there.   * The key layout is weird. The F4 key closes the open screen and the F6 key locks your      trackpad so if you do dev work and use F5 to refresh a lot (like I do), it'll drive you mad.      I ended up having to use xmodmap to completely unprogram both F4 and F6.   * Speakers are moderately loud but have almost no bass.   * A full battery charge lasts ~90 minutes on full brightness, doing average tasks.     I've squeaked ~4 hours out if it's super-dim but don't expect more than that."," I've mentioned this before in other reviews but: I tend to prefer solutions that are cheap. For me, buying a machine + maxing out its upgrades for < $550 was important, so for people like me (for whom the performance + price point outweigh the inevitable mishaps and lost time for fixes later), I'd recommend it.Knowing what I know now, I'd likely have spent $100ish more to get a better-made machine with approximately the same performance. All in all: It's a capable machine at a good price. I'd have given it 4 eggs if not for the electric shock, but I can't it good conscience give 80% to a machine that could ostensibly kill a person on a pacemaker, etc.",1,1

Why anyone would want to go out of their way to put Lenovo programs on their laptop is beyond me. Let alone take extra space on the hard drive just in dedication to those programs. I know I never use them, but some others might beg to differ. It is probably on your laptops, too.

I recently have become a fan of solid state hard drives and it is impossible to find a laptop with a SSD for less than $800, and they all included more than I needed. Found this laptop for $390 and purchased a SSD for $90. When switching hard drives I did a fresh install of Windows 8 to remove all of the bloatware (I didn't attempt to remove anything manually but I heard it is not easy to remove it all). Currently the laptop boots in about 3 seconds and has exceeded all of my expectations for the price. One question I had prior to purchasing the laptop (since I swapped hard drives) was whether it is SATA II or SATA III. The documentation doesn't include the G50-80 and I couldn't find anything online. I have personally seen it use 100% of the hard drive at 6MB/s, therefore I can confirm it is SATA III.",1,1

I got this for $419 on sale and thought it was a steal because it had good reviews. I didn't get the product it was made out to be. I get disconnected from the internet every 3 minutes and it takes another 3 to reconnect. The mouse pad is horrid. The software they had already put on the PC is absolute trash and some of it interfered with normal website surfing. I don't know if I got a damaged laptop or what but this is complete garbage and I would have rather shopped at a grocery store for a $100 one that would have the same performance. I can't return it and don't want to pay shipping and handling for them to repair this trash. Have to deal with this laptop for next 2 years... O joy.,,1,3

I am a graduate student and mostly use the computer for Microsoft office and image analysis on ImageJ.  The processor is snappy, it boots quickly, and has no issue opening large image files.

9SIAAVC49D8239,34-318-466,5/30/2015 6:19:05 PM,Inanc A.,Great laptop for the price,5," Perfect price point with many great features. The specs are comparable to many high-end laptops with half the price tag.Runs cool. After running CPU intensive applications or watching 1080p videos, the laptop barely got lukewarm. This is a true ""laptop"" you can use without getting a first degree burn. Quiet operation. Even when the cooling fan goes into high RPM mode with demanding applications running, it is still quiet. With normal use, you cannot even hear the fan.Stock video performance is good with no freezing or stuttering with 1080p. The screen can get quite bright and colors are vivid. No video performance problems so far. The sound is loud and clear with stereo speakers. No buzzing sound coming from either the speakers or the bezel even at high volume settings. Additional sound profile customization is available with the Dolby software package that is provided.Access to components inside the laptop requires very little effort; very easy to upgrade the memory, HDD etc. if you decide to do so in the future.Easy control of the sound, screen brightness, screen sharing and many other features with just one click of a key instead of a combination of function keys.The trackpad and mouse sensitivity is good overall. There is an additional third party software (ELAN) included that lets you adjust many other settings and features such as scrolling, zooming, palm tracking etc.All the Lenovo drivers are saved onto a seperate D partition on the hard disk. A great time saver when you need to re-install the OS."," The keyboard flexes in the middle. The left mouse button is a bit harder to press compared to the right button. The trackpad can interfere and cause unintentional operation while typing; still trying to find a good compromise with the sensitivity versus the operability settings. Overall, minor annoyances that should not cause major mental health problems.Battery life could be a bit better. Averages about 4 hours or less with screen brightness set at 60% and with light use. More on that below.Tons of bloatware pre-installed. Most of them can be uninstalled but some are hidden deep within the system and is hard to get rid of completely. The best way to get rid of them is to clean install Windows 8.1 or your favorite OS. More on that below as well."," Replaced the HDD with an SSD. First, installed the Windows 8.1 OS from scratch with the UEFI support option; went smoothly. Then, installed the OS from scratch with the legacy support option; also went smoothly. All of the installation options were tested both on HDD and SSD with no problems encountered. Complete installation took around 10 minutes with SSD, compared with the 40+ minutes with the stock HDD. (The stock 5400 RPM HDD performance is actually not bad for daily use). All of the bloatware is gone. All the unnecessary and hidden partitions are gone. It is still a good idea to keep the drivers on a separate partition, however.After the SSD replacement, the overall performance of the laptop is increased significantly. The battery life is increased to about 5 hours or so with light use of the computer (again with 60% screen brightness setting and not streaming or watching movies etc.) and maybe another 45 min or so with CPU intensive applications running.",9,11

I had them side by side while I was cleaning up the old laptop and setting up the new one, and wow. The screen is brighter, images crisper, loading smoother, sounds clearer, and it felt, well, sexy.Setup (and downloading/installing all my games) was quicker than any other laptop/pc I've ever owned. It really didn't take much of my time to eliminate the bloatware either, and most of it didn't take up much space to begin with.I'm on twitch.tv a lot, and I tested this guy out streaming Heroes of the Storm and it performed quite admirably, no visible skipping or lag, and clear image from the webcam.I was able to view two streams simultaneously with little to no hiccups, while downloading updates to LoL/Battlenet/Steam. I almost never saw a thinky cursor in the 30 minutes from the time I plugged it in to the time I was done setting it up. (Most of that time was wasted trying to navigate Windows 8)"," Windows 8 is the opposite of intuitive or useful.It's plastic. It looks great, but the case is definitely obviously plastic. I don't mind, it's lightweight and slim, but I know others who would see this as a con.The keyboard tends to buckle a bit while typing, I think it's a mat-style board so if you tend to push down hard on the keys this may be a problem for you. I'll get used to it; overall I really like the keyboard format."," Newegg rules.-Shipped at lightening speed (i had it in my home in less than 48 hours)-Packed well/safely-This price is unreal.

The all plastic case feels a little cheap after using Samsung Chronos, and Dell Precision Laptops with metal housings, but this didn't cost anywhere near what those models cost and is also much lighter.  Screen is bright and keyboard is large and comfortable.  Optical drive is a plus since a lot of slimlines are not including them.  Battery life is good at 2.5 hours or so for web browsing and regular tasks like data entry, office productivity.  Case is matte finish and doesn't show fingerprints or get ""slimy"" to the touch when using the palmrest or trackpad.  The trackpad itself is responsive unlike other brands like ASUS and Samsung. Latest Intel Chipset and Video which is a plus."," Windows 7 was difficult to get installed because the wifi and Bluetooth drivers offered by Lenovo didn't work.  There was another driver that said the system wasn't supported but I cannot remember which one it was.  I ended up getting the drivers from Lenovo for the Bluetooth and wifi from my own internet search that came from another model.  All other aspects of the W7 downgrade were fine.  Change bios to use legacy support worked fine, backed up my W8 key before hand with produkey for reinstall later and made restore discs before the downgrade.

I read his review of this particular laptop and for the most part made my final decision based off of his review.  I did research on the lenovo brand as well as making sure it lined up with my plans of use for a notebook.  A student attending college classes needing something with decent power.  A quick CPU that an i5 delivers, Ample memory plus capability to add more easily.  Hard Disk I can easily replace to a higher capacity but I don't see the need right now as I have two 2TB USB drives.  It's a quick little machine at a ""GREAT"" price tag.  Thanks new egg.  Window's 8.1 installed.  Yeah the interface takes some getting used to after using XP, Vista, ME, 9x for so long.  But it brings a fresh take to the table.  We'll see as time goes.  Boot process is lightning fast.", The keyboard does take a little getting used to as it is a little tighter than my previous laptop which I'm hanging on to.  Just as backup machine.  I wish the keyboard was back lit but I can't have everything for a nice price tag.  The only other thing I could probably say would be a nice addition since it is a High Definition display is having a blu ray player out of the box instead of DVD but that could be a later upgrade.," Windows 8.1 is a fresh new GUI.  I like having the up to date at least until 10 is released OS to learn and familiarize myself with,  The more hands on you have with something the better.  The laptop isn't piled with unwanted software at start which is a nice change for once at least from what I've seen.  I can't stand Mc Afee but I won't turn down a free trial.   Again the keyboard will probably be the biggest thing to get used to but it's not that big of a deal to overly concern yourself with when considering this machine.  It's a great laptop for students.  It's lightweight and affordable.  Gaming I haven't done anything really with but I can imagine most MMO's you can play such as WOW for one as long as you don't crank the setting to maximum.  Other than that Great laptop.  Thanks Lenovo, and Newegg!",6,6

Able to get an i5 machine with more the 4gb RAM for the price of an entry level i3 machine.This is an entry machine not a high end notebook, so there is only one usb 3 port and lower resolution than $2000 machine, but you only pay less than $500 including shipping and tax.I could complain about the tight keyboard with the 10 key pad (actually having the 10 key pad is an advantage for using Spanish characters), but why.

9SIAAVC49D8239,34-318-466,3/25/2015 10:58:24 AM,Scott C.,Best laptop in its price range,5," The full-size keyboard layout is good, with a full number pad. Although some keys are smaller (the keypad 0 is shortened to make room for the right arrow) they are mostly in the standard location.Sound output is very good (considering the lower bass from the speaker size), with no distortion at high volumes.The screen gets very bright and colors are good after software calibration. Up-down contrast shifting is minimal.Video card performance is amazing - I was able to eke out 50-70 FPS on Low and 30-50 FPS on Medium settings for World of Warcraft. MMOs and older games are very playable at native resolution (1366x768) with medium quality settings on the 5500 internal graphics.Although the included HDD is only 5200 RPM, performance was good overall at roughly 80MBps.The case is solid with no noticeable flex. All surfaces other than the screen bezel are ""brushed metal"" textured matte plastic and don't show grease or fingerprints easily.The laptop is very easy to upgrade. There is a single large bottom panel that exposes both memory slots, the HDD caddy, and the mini-PCIe slot (wifi card pre-installed and the antenna wires routed to the slot). Everything is reachable with minimal effort.All drivers are loaded onto the C drive of the laptop - no need to go to the Lenovo site to download them! I copied them to a USB thumbdrive as a backup."," The CPU won't recognize higher speed RAM - the hard limit is DDR3-1600, so if adding memory get the lowest CAS (at 1.35 volts or lower) rating you can. The CPU also won't recognize regular-voltage RAM. There are two slots for a maximum of 2x8GB.Key travel is extremely limited, around 2mm. There isn't much feedback from hitting keys. The NumLock key is right next to the backspace and will be hit on accident unless you get used to the layout.The battery is probably too small. In real-world testing I got about 3 hours of web browsing with the screen at high brightness. The laptop is low-power overall and could do a lot better with a bigger battery.The screen is TFT and has poor side to side viewing angles - although colors don't badly shift brightness is very affected. Up and down is not as bad as most screens of this type - just some color shifting depending on screen tilt.There are many, many hidden partitions on the drive for BIOS options, recovery options, and other things. Cloning the drive to a SSD was very difficult, and I ended up changing the BIOS boot settings to ""Legacy"" from UEFI-only and re-installed Win8.1"," The BIOS and boot options are accessed by booting from a power button hidden next to the power port; there is no keyboard code for entering the BIOS.The wired LAN port has an attached flap - this is designed to stay in place as you connect the cable, it doesn't stay moved out of the way if you try and open it manually.The (small) power brick connector looks very much like a USB type-A port, there's probably the possibility of confusion if you don't pay attention to the port layout.6GB of RAM seems enough for most uses, I ended up not needing to upgrade it to 8.",19,19

It had the wrong video driver installed (see ""Other thoughts"" for details)."," I needed a personal laptop that I could take with me when traveling (to keep on top of my e-mail) without putting a dent in my wallet, so the price/rebate combo was the #1 reason I chose this one.  I'm also familiar with this laptop because I once used a company-issued EliteBook.  The 90-day warranty protection sure beats buying a used one elsewhere with no warranty.When I started up my 8440p, I was stunned to find that the video driver was ""Standard VGA monitor""--I say ""stunned"" because this laptop is refurbished (I thought it would have already had correct and up-to-date drivers installed already).  After doing some research, I found that my 8440p is equipped with the Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 5700MHD, so it should have come with the drivers for that, not ""Standard VGA monitor"". (The ""Standard VGA monitor"" driver resulted in subpar resolution and the inability to install a graphics-intensive program that would not run with that driver, but which installed and ran just fine once I located and installed the correct Intel driver with the help of the Intel Driver Update Utility).  (Disclaimer--not all 8440p's have an Intel GMA; others have an Nvidia integrated graphics card, so you may want to check with HP support to find out which graphics card you have.)One more note--the same construction that makes this laptop so durable also makes it relatively heavy.  (I did not list it in the cons because it is not a con for me personally, but it may be a con for someone who prefers that their laptop be light in weight.)",1,1

I mean that it would run fine then stop moving data for a few seconds. Then it would be fine for a short while and then do it again (very annoying). I took the drive out and replaced it with one i had lying around and the problem was gone. I am running a surface test to see if it qualifies as a bad drive as it is still under toshiba warranty. I note that does not fail to format and take the stress of a new install of the op sys.  Toshiba's website is a real PITA to navigate and find out how to RMA a drive back to them. I may be stuck with what seems to be a perfectly fine storage drive (but no good for an op system) I tried it in another laptop and my results were stuttering in that laptop as well. I refuse to send the elitebook back to Newegg as it is in like new condition and it really does run great with a different hard drive in it. Sending it back might get me a beat up refurb. That would be worse than a funky hard drive that i can easily replace. It is worth noting that the cover on the bottom of the laptop was not re-seated properly in the refurbishing process, which may indicate that the US Micro tech refurbing the unit noticed something was odd and still passed it on anyway.",,4,5

9SIA4RR2YJ1980,83-250-503,12/11/2013 7:30:21 PM,Jeff E.,,5," One of the things that really swayed me to this laptop is the construction. It's built like a tank with an aluminum body and magnesium frame. Wear and tear is to be expected with refurbished laptops, but this one is nearly flawless. I credit the solid build quality.Windows 7 was the other big draw for me. Most new laptops that I looked at offered Windows 7 through ""downgrade rights"" from Windows 8. Having 7 pre-installed and shipping with both 32 and 64 bit installation disks was a huge bonus.The technology in the laptop is not the latest generation, but it's still more than enough for typical business and computing needs.The price is unbeatable. A few years back, I paid more money for a less capable netbook. Even compared to similar refurbished units, this laptop gets you the absolute most bang for your buck."," Only thing I didn't like about this laptop was there was some sticky liquid that had been dripped on the right side of the keyboard. Cleaned up easily enough, but something the refurbishing company should have done."," I spent a lot of time pouring over laptops before settling on this one. I bought this primarily for work to take to job sites. I needed something small enough to carry around easily, but still big enough that I had a decent sized screen to read and a keyboard that is easy to type on. This laptop fit the bill perfectly.I was worried about how fast it would boot, so I put a new 256GB SSD in. It didn't take long to boot with the supplied HDD, but installing the SSD gets me from power button to logged on in only 24 seconds.Something I was curious about was if the RAM was one 4GB stick or two 2GB sticks. Obviously, if it was just one stick, upgrading to the 8GB max would be easy, but after receiving the laptop it did end up being two sticks. 4GB is plenty (especially at this price) for most users, but time will tell if I might need to upgrade.",6,6

N82E16834234023,34-234-023,1/11/2017 2:01:01 PM,George C.,Fantastic for the sale price of 700!! But...,4," I am a full-time video producer and I have used this laptop for about a month now. I've used all of its features and abilities and pushed it to its limit with my work so I think I have a very good nuanced view of the pros and cons of this laptop. If you take any review of this laptop seriously, make sure its mine.-Powerful. Very nice specs for the price range. This is, in a nut shell, an upper-mid-tier laptop for a lower-mid tier price. I got it for 699 on sale though. I see the regular price is about 999, which isn't unfair, but if you're buying it for 999 then I would disregard some of my praise. 999 is fair, but not an amazing steal or anything.-The inclusion of the number pad (which is uncommon for 15-inch laptops), back-lit keyboard, 4 USB ports, HDMI out and an SD card reader make it very useful in a wide variety of situations. I do video production for an ad agency and also some gaming and so far it has handled nearly everything I've thrown at it. And since there is room for me to upgrade the RAM I suspect I'll be able to push it further.-The SSD HDD combo is fantastic. This is the main thing that makes the laptop a good deal. Sold State Drives are expensive and the fact that they were able to cram one in this laptop, for this price, is just great. Bootups and shut downs are very fast and rendering big video files to the SSD are nice and quick."," -The biggest and most unforgivable aspect of this laptop is the touchpad. It is absolutely garbage. The same surface that you use to mose the cursor around is ALSO the surface of the left and right click buttons. This means when you move the pointer over something that you want to click, then go to click, you have a very good chance of throwing the pointer off to the left by mistake when you press the left click button. This is extremely annoying. 90% of what I do on this laptop is a lot of technical video editing and gaming, so I use a mouse for those things. If you want this laptop for similar situations, then don't worry too much about it I guess, but if you just want to casually lay in bed and browse netflix, youtube, or facebook, then prepare to be annoyed. Seriously. Its almost unusable. How Asus messed this aspect up is beyond me, but they totally did.-The Screen is not the best. Its clearly a 1080 display, but you do not have a lot of options with angles. You really need to view it from a very specific angle to truly see what is being displayed accurately. Maybe this bothers me more than the average joe because I do a lot of video editing, but I suspect it would be noticeable to a casual user as well.-Battery life is nothing special. I don't quite want to call this a ""con"" but in 2016, in a laptop from Asus, I expected more. If you aren't doing anything too intense you might not notice, but if you do any video editing, gaming, or anything even relatively intensive, expect the battery life to plummet. Its not terrible, I just expected a little more."," Overall, I reiterate my point that this is a pretty nice laptop for a more-than-fair price. You would be hard-pressed to find a better deal in that price range. It is not perfect, but you're not going to find perfect for under a grand. This is probably the best you can do in the 700 range.",4,5

I run H1Z1 high settings, WoW on High AVG 75 FPS, League and other games this machine does not flinch. I have since purchasing upgraded the RAM to 16GB, swapped out the HDD with Samsung EVO 850 500GB, placed a Samsung 128GB into the M.2. I gotta tell ya, this competes with my custom built gaming desktop! I don't use the trackpad like most gamers I have a gaming mouse. The razr naga. You won't be disappointed."," Not really a con but for most people complaining about the sound and heat. You should ALWAYS, with any laptop buy a cooling pad that elevates off of the flat surface and provides a mesh cooling surface to allow constant airflow.  My machine barely gets warm with the great cooling built in plus my cooling angled pad that I play with. This will allow the speakers to be heard richly the way they actually sound. It also prevents your gpu and CPU from getting anywhere close to overheating.", Alienware is cool and all but if I have better specs made by the same company for half the price.

Okay, no big deal; I needed a laptop for school, so I sent them a few emails (to which they never even bothered to reply), and went back to focusing on my education.Less than TWO months later, my laptop's display began flickering.  It was the end of the school year, so I bit my tongue until I could finally take time to contact Dell.  They offered to expedite my repair so that it would take anywhere from 3 to 5 business days.

I love the design, matte black with red highlights.  Feels like a solid build.  The screen is very nice, looks best when the brightness is turned all the way up.  Windows 10 makes some of the text look fuzzy but after spending time in it, I realized, it was Windows 10.  The core i7 is snappy, everything on the OS is very fast including boot-up.  I love the 4GB GTX 960M.  It's not a super powerhouse but it gets the job done and can play all my AAA titles at full resolution.  Having 4GB of VRAM is important to get hi-res textures loaded and have lots of them on the screen at once.  Having a 960 rather than something higher keeps the temperatures down which is what I prefer.  Battery will last longer too.  In fact, even with the power level set to performance, the laptop had a 9+ hour battery life during regular use (not gaming).  This blew me away.  I suspect it has to do with the 6700 gen Core i7.  Only a few things need to be tweaked in games such as turning down Anti-Aliasing.  But with a 15"" screen at 1920x1080, anti-aliasing is really not needed.  This Inspiron i7559 is a great gaming laptop, especially for someone who just wants to catch up on gaming while away from home.  At least that is what I use it for.  Combine it with a gaming mouse or an XBOX controller and you've got console level gaming on-the-go."," I have had no hardware or software issues which seems to be where most of the negative reviews come from.  The hard drive is hybrid, which is not very clear on the specs.  Performance does not seem to be affected.  In all, I have no issues with the laptop and everything is up-to-date, hardware drivers, the NVidia driver and software.  It runs great."," I recently purchased this laptop through Dell using a promotional code.  It was a deal that could not be passed up.  I had been interested in getting a laptop so I can game away from home and wanted something with at least 4GB video RAM plus nothing less than a GTX 960M.  Turns out that its a pretty incredible mid-level gaming laptop.  I play all the AAA titles and so far it can run all of them at full resolution.  The graphic settings on each game need to be tweaked a little.  As mentioned in the pros, turning down AA to the lowest setting really helps performance on the games.  Yet the graphics still look great since its on a small-ish 15"" screen.  Anyway, so far I have been really impressed and I am very excited to be able to game when I travel away from home.  I've had no issues hardware or software with the laptop.  Windows 10 and the drivers are up-to-date.  This Inspiron i7559 is a smooth machine.  Everyone who gave it a bad review seems to have been unlucky with hardware issues.  Fortunately I have had none.  But if I do run into one, I will be patient and take advantage of the warranty.  If you are on the fence, but, for example, looking into getting a good gaming laptop to maybe catch up on some games while away, this is an excellent buy.  Get a gaming mouse and XBOX controller to go with it.",None,None

I got 25-30FPS with pretty much all high settings on Witcher 3 which is one of the most intensive games out there with all high settings and even some ultra settings, except for a couple like render distance and background NPCs turned way down. This GPU is good enough to make all the textures and sparkly stuff look great if you know how to tweak your settings like I mentioned above to Witcher. I also just finished building a desktop, has a Skylake i5-6500, R9 380 4GB, 16GB DDR4 memory and that is stuff that's just one blow the highest out there, yet going from gaming on it to here on the laptop I don't feel like I'm stepping back int he stone age or anything which is what always used to happen to me with other laptops.I got mine even cheaper at Christmas (same everything, although I got 8GB of memory and no SSD) for only 750 which was insane value. This is still great value for a gamer. If you aren't, you can definetly find stuff cheaper that will suit your needs just as well. But for gamers, you are going to have to spend at least 450 more to jump up to a new level.Has a really nice Dell Power Plan app that basically you set your work/school/playtime in each day and it keep syour battery at a lower charge when it's your downtime, and then charges it up to full to be ready for when you say your uptime begins. Helps long term battery health a lot. You can also change these settings in the BIOS, and it works even when the computer is off, screen down but plugged in. Has a real quality look and feel to it. From the texture where you wrists are at to the screen to they keys themselves will are as good as it'll get in a laptopSpeaking of the keyboard, it's full size actually! Perfect for a gamer. It doesn't come iwth a lot of bloatware which is awesome...It's whisper quiet when not gaming, you can't even hear it even if there's no other noise unless you get your ear close to the fan outlets.Doesn't get too hot on the lapHas two nice plastic lips on the bottom that allow airflow, keep it from sliding around keep it from getting scratched."," The plug comes out kind of easyAs someone else said, the touch pad placement can be annoying but once you get used to it you don't activate it at all. If you need to turn it on and of a lot I suggest going to the control panel>mouse/keyboard options, then pinning that to the start bar so it's only two clicks away"," I reccomend people edit their high performance, plugged in plan, so that's it's 100% all the time for everything basically. Doesn't come standard like that. When it's plugged in I want all that performance always there.",1,2

Definitely looks better than the pictures.- Enormous 4GB dedicated GRam is definitely one of its best features-Great feel on the keyboard-Light and easy to carry around for its size-Sufficient USB Ports, USB 3.0 ports are not a sham, grrat transfer speed. -Comes with surprising little bloatware for a manufacturer's laptop. -8GB Ram is surprisingly enough even for DDR3"," I don't really like the screen display. On some details it looks blurry and unclear then on other things it looks really clear. Probably common with the IPS matte.-Touchpad position is awkward. As a casual FPS gamer the touchpad is definitely a nuisance as your wrist might touch it once a while. There's a setting that disables it when you plug in a mouse. -Numlock seems to not stick. (Have to manually trigger num lock everytime after shutdown and boot)-8GB Hybrid SSHD makes not much difference honestly. Definitely need a standalone SSD. I plan to get the Samsung 850 Evo for mine. If you don't plan to remove the current HDD and just add a new SSD, the form factor of choice seems to be the M.2 2280.

There are still rooms to improve but what do you expect ? It's a budget gaming laptop ! For $894 it's definitely a score considering its specs and Dell definitely did a good job with this series. Great buy for peopld looking for laptops under $1000. The extra budget space allows for SSD or Ram upgrades (Open slot for an M.2 SSD and a stick of RAM) or maybe even peripherals.

During that half minute you can only use the track pad.Mouse freezer Level 2: the bluetooth mouse loses connections out of no reason, and would not re-pair up unless I restart the system.Mouse freezer Level 3: no pointing device would move the mouse around, not even the track pad. all you can do is continue sliding your fingers hoping it would come back at some point.System crusher Level 1: when 3D is being rendered, the system goes through a short freeze, and the speaker would repeat a short slice of sound that the system was playing prior to the freeze. System crusher Level 2: when GPU is on heavy load, the screen freezes for a while and goes black. it will usually repair it self and prompt me saying that the intel graphics driver has just crushed but has successfully returned to working.System crusher Level 3: when restoring windows 10 as a measure of solving the aforementioned problems, the system freezes at 99%. I when to the gym and back and it's still at 99%. I cooked a beef pot and come back seeing it at 99%. I finished eating and cleaning and it's at 99%. Back from Wamlart and it's still 99%. Finally I had to force shut down and restart, and it went normal.Bluetooth strike Level 1: the bluetooth panel wouldn't find my bluetooth mouse while a room of my other devices are ready to pair with it. Restarting BOTH the PC AND the mouse CAN solve the problem. Sometimes.Bluetooth strike Level 2: the bluetooth panel finds my bluetooth mouse and says ""connected"", while the LED indicator on my mouse is showing that it was looking for device to pair up.3D blackout Level 1: a game in my collection that i used for testing would render as a black screen. some objects at the foreground is rendered correctly but the critical parts are blacked out. I wanted to love its form factor and its value, but I could not give these serious problems. I will exchange it in hope that I got a defect unit and was in an extreme situation.

And I also streamed these games on twitch with youtube music - it was streaming smoothly. I was so surprised that with this laptop, it could function well as compared to high end PCs.3- The packaging is very simple - comes with laptop and a charger, and it's suitable for people who just want to plug in the laptop from the box and play !4- I ran CS GO on highest setting for 2 hours straight and it didnt even get over heated. While it made some noise on the laptop from time to time (couldnt hear it as I had microphone over my ears), it was almost unnoticeable.5- The laptop cools down really fast and stays really quiet when doing light tasks (browsing internet, watching youtube)6- It plays 4k quality videos on youtube !", 1- I wouldve preferred Windows 7.

When it dropped to $800 on a Black Friday week deal, I decided to gamble and pull the trigger. Some tips for making sure you don't end up with an expensive paperweight:Update your graphics and wireless drivers right out of the box. This should be the first thing you do.Google ""eDellRoot removal"" (eDellRoot is a service that allows Dell computers a ridiculously easy backdoor entry for hackers) and find the Dell automatic removal tool. Download and run it to make sure you don't have it - if you do, let the Dell tool delete it.Update any remaining drivers you might be having an issue with.It's frustrating that a mid-to-high grade performance laptop requires some fixing straight out of the box, so I'm giving it four stars. A couple of other things to consider about this laptop:If you need a computer for graphics design, this isn't it. The screen is sharp, and looks quite nice, but RGB gamut isn't great and screen bleed on the lower edge could throw your image off.If you need a responsive touchpad, this is as far away as you're going to get from one. It works okay for sitting on the couch surfing the net, but I'd never do any real work with it. It's covered in a rough-textured plastic that doesn't feel good, it doesn't track one finger movement that well, and it doesn't track two-finger movement hardly at all. Get to be friends with your scroll bars, because your gestures will barely register, if at all.Many users report deal-breaking errors, such as screen flickering, severe GPU throttling/crashing, failure to recognize the boot drive, and wireless connectivity issues. Updating drivers may solve some of these errors.I've been using this fairly regularly for about a week now and have had no issues whatsoever with mine. Time will tell, but there's nothing so far that indicates that this machine will catastrophically fail early in its lifetime. I've also done a bit of gaming on it, and while the fans spin up a little loudly (of course), the machine seems to stay pretty cool and I've not noticed any visible throttling after about an hour of intense graphics rendering.Dropping an egg from the score because buyer-beware - you might have to fix the computer right out of the box. Otherwise it's an incredibly powerful machine for very little dough. I recommend it if you're fairly tech-savvy and know where to look to resolve driver issues.",17,18

I'm reporting on (and owning 2 units) of the 15.6 screen 256 GB M2 SSD 1 TB 5400 HDD w 16 GB RAM.  Got the external DVD which was important for backup / restore of the OS.  Didn't consider the 17 inch as it's hard to find cases / wheelies for that size.  The 15.6 inch display is great.  Bought the first one for me with the anticipation of giving it / a second one to my son as a gaming laptop.  I needed a business / developer laptop for typical work plus VMs as I'm a techie.  Machine arrives (costs about a grand) and is high quality.  VMs suck in performance on the storage HDD.  I upgrade to an SSD for my second drive and this thing rocks.  My son tries out his games and we're in for a second unit as a christmas present.  Point being is I love this unit x 2 -- sound is great; screen is great; backlit keyboard is great; etc., Non-glare screen is to taste.  Blow dryer can remove the plastic non-glare coating.  Search on the web for a video.This is not a small nor a light unit.  No touchscreen on this pre-configured version.  It's as a desktop replacement / gaming laptop.5400 RPM storage drive works great for my son's gaming; not so much for virtual machines.  Not a knock as this machine wasn't intended as a high powered developer laptop (with an SSD it does a great job)No removable battery.  You can open the case to replace.  I did it to replace the HDD with an SSD.  Google the procedureHas a high-end graphics card that is only used when a high-end graphics app (game) requires it.  At first I thought this was odd.  Turns out it works pretty well.  Saves battery live.  My son's video games have had no issue.," My last few laptops have been ASUS because I'm looking for that little bit extra.

Obviously this is subjective, but I find it much more appealing than others I looked at before purchasing.Not overwhelmed with bloatware.  Ready to use, and IBM thankfully doesn't lay on the proprietary software too heavily.  A bit though.Marvelously fast boot (thanks to PCI-E SSD) and wonderful performance in games.  Generally max settings as of Dec 2016 in a number of games I tested, including WoW, ESO, Dark Souls 3, and many more.  1TB HDD makes for a great package of videos and music you can save in addition to plenty of installed software on the SSD."," The biggest thing that bugged me for a while was noticing the keyboard would randomly quit after a while.  This is easily fixed with a BIOS update from IBM's website, but I didn't immediately suspect that since it only started occurring after installing several programs and peripherals, leading me to assume driver conflict or something.   Comes with McAfee trialware bugging you to subscribe or purchase or whatever.  Do yourself a favor and uninstall before it screws up your registry.  (A problem I've had with it in the past, apologies if that's no longer an issue.)"," As someone who generally frowns upon most pre-built systems, I think others like me would enjoy this system.

N82E16834331907,34-331-907,12/3/2016 11:19:01 PM,Neil R.,Early Review,5," The computer is fast and seems well built. These are the reasons I bought the computer, so it's good to get confirmation. The speed is great, the build feels solid. Backlit keyboard is great for use in the dark, especially for gamers. Major style points.It might be a little too early to make the call on the battery. But it seems to charge at the regular speed (feels slow but the app I installed to track it says it's charging at the right speed), and hold a strong charge, Obviously if you push it any/all of the functions (ie, brightness, volume, heavy programs, etc), the battery life will suffer, as those kinds of activities are better suited to having the laptop plugged in. At this point, battery is all I would ask for. I'll get more familiar with it as time goes on.Sound system wasn't quite as loud as I'd hoped, but it's super clean and the base comes through. So while I won't be using the native speakers to show anybody new songs (I'll use some speakers with a bit more power), I will probably be content using the native speakers to stream TV and movies when viewing solo."," So the touch pad is a bit of a weakness. Lenovo has a tendency to make the click on the touch pad too deep. It sounds trivial, but it makes using the touch pad very difficult for common and simple tasks. Want to highlight some text, drag and drop a file? The touch pad makes this into a frustrating wrestle. And while the click requires too much effort and depth, the actually touch sensitivity is very high, so browsing the internet and typing is frequently interrupted by random zooming and jumping cursors. The charging plug looks solid, but I still prefer the mac magnetic attachment (from my very short list of things I like about mac, though mac is actually phasing out the magnet plug.)The Ctrl button is strangely far from the other buttons. So (I'm a 6ft man and wear sized L gloves) while my hands can reach Ctrl+V easily, my hands cannot reach Ctrl+B without effort. I can get it if I move my wrist down, but if I'm using the bold feature frequently, I will lose speed typing compared to other keyboards. The only real reason I'm bringing this up is for people with small hands who might want a tighter keyboard set up.VERY prone to finger prints. The exterior, the interior, everything. Pretty much anywhere on this computer that is black will get nasty finger grease spots at the first touch. So for those of you who are a bit OCD, you might want to look somewhere else."," fn+space lights up the keyboard, makes it brighter, then turns it off. I sort of wish the speakers lit up too, just for the style, but there's no practical reason for them to light up.At the price of 899$ it was a steal. I definitely reccommend this computer for those who don't have money to waste and want speed and solid computer.Most if not all of the CONS are very trivial and most of the PROS are must haves. I turned off the touchpad pinch zoom so that I didn't have random zooming on websites, and I usually use a wireless mouse. I have other speakers, so I'm not concerned that the speakers don't have a huge volume. And while not super happy about the fingerprints, I can deal with them.So I say it's a great buy. At this price, I can't justify taking off any stars for trivial flaws. If you want perfect, go buy a comp worth three thousand dollars, and it still won't be perfect. 5 Stars.",1,1

They remotely connected to the laptop and could not figure out what was wrong and said they did not deal with software(hardware people don't know about drivers???). So they connected me to a ""software"" person for further support - but I had to purchase a software contract to get this support(1 year for $200).

To save time for others who want to do the same, it seems that you need to remove absolutely all the partitions otherwise w7 will not work. W8 does not play nice with others.

Took a chance on the Acer chat site, here is the actual chat message: Helika Sumi: Michael, thank you for being on hold. I appreciate your patience.  Helika Sumi: I have checked the information for you. Helika Sumi: As per our resources, your computer is upgradeable up to 16GB SODIMM DDR3 1333/1600. Helika Sumi: It has 2 DDR3L Socket. Helika Sumi: The Support DIMM voltage is 1.35V. Michael Dunn: I purchased the notebook from Newegg and it says the max is only 8 GB.  just want to be sure before ordering more memory. Helika Sumi: The support memory size per socket is 2GB/4GB/8GB.  Helika Sumi: The maximum memory is 16 GB.I took a chance that the chat was correct.  I ordered G.SKILL Ripjaws Series 16GB (2 x 8G) 204-Pin DDR3 SO-DIMM DDR3 1600 (PC3 12800) Laptop Memory Model F3-1600C9D-16GRSL from NewEgg.  The laptop does support 16 GB of memory.  Initially I put in both dimm's and the laptop didn't boot up.  Took one dimm out and the laptop booted up without any problems.  Powered down the notebook and took the 8GB dimm in the right slot and move it to the other slot and then inserted the other 8GB dimm.  I'm kind of impatient and I believe it just took a while for the BIOS to recognize the new memory.  My notebook running with 16GB of memory without any problems.  loving it!!!"," Didn't come with an internal DVD R/W optical drive, but my USB DVD drive works fine."," Had no problems upgrading to Windows 8.1 (free upgrade), also downloaded a nice utility called ""Classic Start"" that give you a start button in windows 8 for people like myself who still like the windows 7 start button feel,",3,3

Does everything it needs to do and runs games such as Minecraft and League of Legends with relatively high FPS (45-65) on higher settings. The latest gen CPU (4th gen) was worth purchasing.  You only need to slide a small tab to pull out the battery which is good if you like to save the lifespan of the battery pack by not using it while plugged in at a desk. The laptop has 2 slots for removable SODIMM-Ram and comes with a single 4gb stick in one. It was easy to install a second 4gb low volt 1.35v ram stick into the second slot., Windows 8 is terrible. It thinks the 15.6inch screen is a 8inch tablet. Everything looks ridiculous in the standard win8 start-up and in all of their apps. Always use desktop mode. Recommend upgrading to 8.1 right away., No CD-drive (Not a problem though). Windows 8 is bad but I do not recommend you purchase an older laptop just because you want Windows 7.

The display is the worst display I have ever seen.  Colors are extremely washed out, and the viewing angle is around 0 degrees, resulting in color gradients even on solid colors.  I tested it by setting a solid black color for the desktop background and I could not find a position for my head where the entire screen actually looked black.  From every angle there was a gray washed out look at the edge of the screen.  The colors inverted around 30 degrees.  The screen is also extremely reflective which doesn't help the issue.Maybe this is just a hardware defect, but since my wife often works with clients and needs to be able to sit with two people looking at the screen, I just don't want to take the risk.

Although once you get past the UI obviously being designed for touch screen (which this machine doesnt have), it hasn't presented any other issues.2)  It maybe related to peripherals or windows 8.1 (i'm using a USB hub, monitor on HDMI (via an adapter), and USB speakers/keyboard/mouse), but I had to disable hibernation.    The machine wouldn't wake up from it.  3)  Installation times seem long.   Not sure if its the hard drive, or windows 8.    Once software is  installed though, it works pretty well flawlessly."," I picked this up for my kids on a black friday special really only expecting it to be mediocre for gaming.    It's actually pretty impressive for the price point.They are primarily using it to play minecraft, terraria, and kerbal space program.   It's handling each of those at relatively high settings with no issues at all.   I honestly was expecting it to play the first two games at low settings and choke on KSP.It actually comes close to handling them as well as my once high end but now aging desktop (i7 with ati hd4850 graphics card and 6gb ram).    The one area it really seems to lag is in hard drive speed, but its probably nothing an SSD upgrade wouldn't solve if one was inclined.",2,3

I found out that the speakers were on the bottom. Not going to be much of a problem for me since I use headphones but just putting it out there. The speakers, since they are so close to the bottom and the laptop itself does not have very elevated ""stand legs"" if you are planning to use the laptop on your lap or something just keep in mind that the sound may come out distorted and vibrate your laptop a bit if you accidentally plug the speakers. Again not something I'd dock off an egg for but it could be better.Overall an excellent laptop for the price. Windows 8 I admit is very weird to me but I'm learning bits and pieces as I go along. My brother managed to install the Start Menu mod thing so it doesn't pop up to the Windows 8 app screen when I press the start button which is great for me.

9SIA0AJ2MW5727,34-314-150,11/17/2013 7:43:18 AM,Arjuna J.,Great Buy,5," This is probably the most laptop you can buy for its price. The 4200U is only slightly faster than its 3rd generation counterpart, but the power consumption and heat is much lower. The biggest pro to this laptop is how cool (temperature) it operates. In my opinion, laptops that can burn your legs will die quickly, but this one is only warm to the touch. Another pro is the how loud the speakers are. Some may put the speakers as a con because they are located on the bottom of the laptop. Even though they are in awkward position, they are still louder than most laptop speakers. There is little difference in sound quality when you pick the laptop up to listen to the speakers directly. Only when you have the laptop on a soft surface (like a bed with a comforter) will the sound be blocked.The 4400 Intel HD graphics is also a great integrated GPU. You will be able to play most new games on the lowest setting and still get a decent frame rate. I installed Hitman Absolution and ran it on lowest settings; the game ran smoothly and it looked great. Gaming is possible on this laptop!The full size keyboard is also nice. I had no problems with the track pad getting in the way of typing; the ELAN driver's palm rejection works just fine.The screen is very bright; at 100% brightness it is actually a little to bright for my eyes. I usually run it at 80% brightness."," The biggest con for this laptop is that it has an empty DVD drive. I don't need a DVD drive, so it isn't a big deal, but usually laptops are smaller/thinner when there isn't a DVD drive. That is not the case with this laptop, it is just as big as if it did have the drive. It seems that that a DVD drive can be installed in the laptop (it looks like the DVD drive cover can be removed from laptop's plastic case, but I'm not sure).The battery is also another con to the laptop. Even though 4200U has lower power consumption it will be hardly noticed because the capacity of the battery is quite small. This does make the laptop very light, however. No extended battery is available yet for this laptop. I get 4 hours battery in power saver mode with 60% brightness watching video. Not terrible.The VERTICAL viewing angle is also pretty poor on the LED screen. The LED screen is actually a very good screen (compared to the Gateway screens), but the 720P resolution may leave something to be desired; I found it just fine. The hinge for the screen is somewhat wobbly, but isn't a deal breaker by any means"," The last thing to point out can be considered both a con and a pro. I was unable to make a windows 8 recovery usb drive (the process would stop at 75% completion, every time). I had bought a 32 gig usb 3.0 thumb drive for the purposes of installing the windows 8 recovery. I called tech support and they sent me a usb 3.0 thumb drive with windows 8 recovery pre-installed. I was not expecting Acer to just give usb drives away for those having trouble creating the recovery drive, but that's exactly what they did! Windows 8 is a very weird operating system. I installed ""Classic Shell"" and uninstalled all the windows 8 apps. Its just like windows 7 now, but more secure with a faster kernel (yay!).",8,8

I knew it didnt have it before I bought it. I'll change the card down the road. The build quality itself feels a bit cheap.," I was looking for something cheap to carry on jobs. Leaned towards this laptop because ALL the fat was trimmed out of it. By fat I mean:*No Optical disk drive* (though the slot is still there). I bought a caddy for the dvd slot and slapped a 1TB drive in there (also replaced the internal hdd with a 1TB drive). Keep in mind, if you plan on buying an hdd caddy for the dvd slot it must be a 9.5mm caddy. It's a snug fit but if you need to remove the caddy afterwards you can push it back out through a hole that's in the battery bay. Took me a while to figure it out.*No bling on the housing* . The housing on this notebook is cheapest i've ever seen/owned. The plastic feels cheap and flexes a bit. Nothing pretty to look at. It's very basic. Deal breaker? Nope. In this price range you might find something prettier but it will not outperform it.Notes:Should go without saying but create a complete factory restore disk (choose the backup partition option also) soon as you get it. Acer charges 45 bucks for a recovery usb stick.If you plan on upgrading the memory make sure you get DDR3L (1.35v). Some memory wont have the ""L"" but as long as it's 1.35v it should work. I tried many 1.5v modules and non worked.",4,4

This is one of the cheapest laptops you can find at the time of this review with 4th gen hardware (and an i5 processor, no less).  This is an ULV (Ultra Low Voltage) processor so it doesn't blow old 3rd gen processors out of the water in terms of performance (you can check the benchmarks).  However, performance is pretty good and you get the benefit of improved graphics (Intel 4400 > Intel 4000) and power consumption.  The processor's max power consumption is listed at 15W compared to 17W for the comparable i5-3337U (3rd gen) processor.  The memory also runs at 1.35V (DDR3L) instead of 1.5V.  The battery on this laptop doesn't have a very large capacity (2500 mAh) but it still manages pretty decent battery life because of the low power consumption.  > Runs quietly and smoothly.  I haven't pushed this laptop to the limit yet, but it is very snappy and responsive even when running lots of applications.  Bootup time is also really fast.> Relatively thin and light and the case is very sleek and aesthetic.  This isn't a MacBook Air or anything but it makes my old Gateway 142-XL tablet look like a dinosaur (even though that one actually has a smaller 14"" screen).  The battery on this is very small physically and doesn't add much bulk to the computer..  > The keyboard is pretty good.  There are spaces between the keys which cuts down on my typing mistakes.  > It is really cheap and easy to upgrade this laptop to 8 GBs of RAM.  I got a 4 GB stick  and popped it in.  There is just one screw on the back holding in a panel that reveals the hard drive and memory.  Just make sure you get memory that can run at 1.35V (DDR3L).  > 15.6"" screen.  It seems pretty bright to me (I actually turned down the brightness a little) but maybe it isn't compared to some other laptops because that is what some reviews indicate.  > Has all the accessories I want like a SD card reader, mic, web cam, and 3 USB ports.> Comes with an app called Soluto which is really handy for optimizing boot performance."," > I would like if the screen were more solidly built.  There is a little more flex in it than I would like but so far this hasn't been a huge issue.  > If you want to use CDs or DVDs, be aware that this laptop has no optical drive.  > In a perfect world, this laptop would come with a 750 GB hard drive but I can't really complain given the low price."," > I read in some reviews that the viewing angles on this screen were poor or average.  I don't know how it compares to other laptops but I have found the viewing to be pretty good when moving from side to side.  If you are looking at the screen from above then that is when you lose some clarity.> Some reviews also made an issue of the fact that the speakers are on the bottom of the laptop.  It sounds loud enough and pretty good quality to me but if you are particular about speakers you might want to look into this. > A lot of people seem to give laptops bad reviews because of Windows 8 and the OS does take a bit of getting used to (everything seems to be in a different place compared to Windows Vista/7).  However, this isn't Acer's fault. In conclusion, this is a great and well rounded laptop for the price.  It has the latest iteration of Intel hardware and it comes in a pretty sleek and lightweight package given that it has a 15.6"" screen.",18,18

The graphics on this machine are amazing and are good enough for casual to medium gamers. I regularly get 4-5 hours of battery life with average use. The weight is very low for this size of a laptop.," The screen seems very flexible and is not sturdy at all. Without the specific Elan driver software, the touch pad renders the keyboard useless due to the location and sensitivity (while typing your palm will bump the touch pad and ruin your typing). This is not really a con as it is a trend with laptops, but this device has NO DVD drive and finding an after market faceplate to fit a drive for the internal bay is nearly impossible currently."," Like many laptops, there is no easy access to the heat sink to allow for the extraction of bunnies.

See the cons below.- Speakers are much better than my previous Lenovo as well.  See the cons below."," - Absolutely atrocious trackpad.  YOU WILL NEED your own pointing device (I'm using a cheap Logitech trackball, works well enough)- While the display is 1080p, I would have preferred larger (more like 17""), and the colors/brightness is a bit iffy at times.  To get a reasonable amount of brightness/contrast to play some games (like Star Trek Online), you need the gamma so high it washes everything out.  Your average movie is more than watchable, though.  No problems with Torchlight II.- Speakers are good enough for general use (games, Netflix, etc), but quite terrible for music.- Minor nitpick, but the fact that both volume keys AND the mute button all require the use of the Function key annoys me.  As well as the placement of them.- No optical drive from the factory, although it does have an empty slot for one."," For the price, this is one of the best deals you can get.  You get a decent CPU, enough RAM, discrete GPU, M.2 slot for your own SSD in addition to the 1TB drive.  None of my complaints would have stopped me from buying it had I known them before purchasing.  I saw at least one review that mentioned the screen/cover was flimsy and needed two hands to open.  I haven't experienced this.  It feels plenty solid to me, and the hinges are super smooth.  Also much better than my previous Lenovo (I'm noticing a trend here)...

And, it's actually pretty good at playing games. It's not a top tier gaming laptop, but it can absolutely game. Upgrade-able! (see below)"," Two cons; First, the screen. Not sure what the technical terms are, but basically, it sucks. It is 1080 resolution, but that's the end of anything positive about it. Colors seems a bit washed out. Fonts that are not optimized for clear type are all fuzzy. My 2 year old LG G3 cell phone has a better screen. it's sad.Second, it's plastic. All of it. And not even good plastic. The touch-pad and keyboard feel cheap. The touch-pad actually moves around when I use it. Not that I use it often. The plastics around the screen are particularly bad. Just opening and closing the lid feels like a strain on the bezel and the screen can actually be seen to deform a little. I'm worried that I might crack the screen just opening the thing."," I bought this laptop with the understanding that I would basically be upgrading it out of the box. Other people have reviewed this machine and noted just how slow the hard drive is. I can vouch for that. It may be huge, but it runs at a snails pace. This particular model has lots of space inside (for a laptop) for upgrades. First: There are 2 memory slots. Of which only one is used. Upgrade to 16 GB of RAM easily with $30 and a screwdriver.Second: There is a mSATA connector for a SSD right next to the RAM. mSATA length isn't an issue because there are screw holes to hold down the 3 most common sizes. Drop a SSD in, copy over your drive and use that 1TB monster for non critical storage.Last: There is no CDROM drive. Leaving you with the option to either a) add your own CDROM drive OR b) purchase a CDROM drive to HDD caddy and install another hard drive.Yes, a 3rd hard drive! Using this method you could easily install a SSD into the mSATA connector. And then install 2 additional drives (HDD or SSD) and have plenty of space.Also of note is an issue I ran into with the Nvidia card not recognizing when I run a GPU accelerated video game. The fix is easy though. Go to the Nvidia control panel (Not the Geforce experience) select manage 3D settings, and under the programs tab select the program you're having trouble with. Then under the 2nd option tell it what video card to use.Mine got stuck trying to play Skyrim using the Intel chip.... it was not successful. But once I told it to use the Nvidia card, it ran like a champ!Great gift idea. I highly recommend.",8,10

Tested Guild Wars 2, Shadow Warrior 2, Grand Theft Auto V, all able to get stable performance with minor settings tuning. 940MX doesn't sound like much, but a 384 CUDA Maxwell can get work done. Dual core HT processor doesn't hold this thing back, Skylake is good like that. It comes shipped with 1x8gb DDR4-2133 and it has a second slot so upgrading to 16gb is cheap and painless. The bottom plate to access the RAM and HDD bay is very easy to open.  Acer builds these things with tinkerers in mind. Keyboard is great and the overall build quality is great. The display is nothing special, but it's not muddy or slow like many budget laptop displays."," Touchpad sucks, I ordered two of these laptops and the touchpad's inconsistency is consistent between them. It gets jumpy and inaccurate for unpredictable periods of time and for seemingly no cause. You can disable the touchpad with function + F7, this thing requires a traditional mouse to use well. I expected this, and I don't care about touch pads as long as there's an easy way to toggle them off which Acer provided. The included HDD is very slow. I also expected this, and I ordered two 525gb MX300 SSDs and installed Windows 10 fresh as soon as I got them. They don't come with a serial key printed anywhere on the laptop or in the documentation, but if you just make a Windows 10 home 64 bit USB installer from Microsoft.com, it automatically detects the laptop as having a valid Windows 10 license and auto activates with no serial key required.",,5,6

I thought it would be bigger actually, but it's a decent size.Excellent i5 6200u processor. This and the graphics card are clearly this machines selling points.Idk what people are saying about being dirt slow. Maybe im just coming from a crappy laptop but this thing is very fast. Web pages come up fairly quickly and even though this machine doesnt come with a ssd, boot up is fairly quick as well. There are some hiccups here and there, but I haven't gotten rid of bloatware yet so maybe I'm not experiencing it's full potential.Better then decent but not quite great game quality. I can play most games at mid level quality. Speakers are a little below decent. They're acceptable though. (to my ears)Again, Idk why people are saying the keyboard is ""mushy"". There isn't that satisfying ""click"" when you press down but it's by no means terrible.I like windows 10. I've always had issues with windows 8.1Build quality isn't terrible. It's all plastic and sturdy enough, so its passable. This thing is also fairly light. I'm a big guy so maybe I dont notice the weight, but it's not a heavy beast of a machine.I gotta say the price is definitely worth it. I had the choice of building a pc or just buying a laptop. I'm more than positive that I could have built a faster, better quality pc. But I like to make music when I travel. So, I figured why not? It's even on sale as of thus post. (I didn't buy it on sale.) I gotta say, I'm happy with my purchase."," The biggest dislike I have to have with this... Is the keyboard. While the keys are aren't mushy and work, the keys are smaller then I expected. I have big hands so maybe it's just me, but gaming with this keyboard is a little difficult.The screen size, while big enough, the quality of the picture is kind of... bland. Nothing really stands out to me color wise and while it works, it could have been better.I'm not to keen on the viewing angles as well. The picture really ""disappears"" if your not right in front of it.(This is more of a complaint rather then a con) I have a couple scratches on the surface of the laptop. Nothing crazy but I thought i would point that out.The touchpad is also very cumbersome. The right and left click don't have it's own buttons and if you're copy and pasting, it can get annoying. I have also encountered a very weird occurrence when restarting. I always get locked in the ""Getting Windows Ready"" screen. Idk why this happens, maybe it's only my machine, but its scary having to power it off by holding the power button.I also think, in my opinion, that a removable battery would have worked well with this machine. I've watched a couple videos on how to open everything up and it seems kind of tidious. I'm not a huge tech guy, so maybe it's because I have little experience with repairing or upgrading laptops.Would also have been nice to have an ssd with this. I know there's other models with them but they're a lot more expensive then this deal."," While this laptop is very good in my eyes, there are some things that could have been improved. I would give this laptop a 3.5 to 3.8 stars. It's a decent and more affordable gaming laptop and while not the best, I think I'll be happy with this machine for a while. If this is the only gaming laptop in your price range, definitely go for it. Its a good price for a mid level gaming laptop. If you can shell out a couple more hundred bucks, get something better. I bought this because I was looking for a deal but in no way am I knocking this. Enjoy.",4,5

That being said....The second I opened this box I pulled out the mechanical drive (WD 1TB Blue series) and threw in a PNY XLR8 240G SSD (not even a ""great"" SSD) and installed a clean copy of Win 10. Anyone that is saying this thing is slow is insane or clearly has no idea what they are doing.This unit is lightning fast with the SSD and boots to a usable desktop in about 7-8 seconds. I now have my clean OS with no bloatware. All drivers installed automatically however I did update the chipsets, wifi, and Nvidia drivers manually. Installed all the OS updates including the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and this thing rocks. The fact I'm only in about $500 with the SSD for a budget gaming notebook I can take with me on the go is a dream come true.I primarily got this so I can play WoW on the go or at friends houses. Display resolution set to 1080, AA and AF minimal or off and everything turned too ""Good"" or ""Normal"" in the old world zones I get close to 60fps. In the Legion zones which are obviously far more detaiked and effects heavy it probably closer to 40-45 but can still hit 60 on occassion. I'm completely blown away that a 2G low end card like the 940MX can do this. I'm incredibly happy with it. Even playing for a few hours straight it really doesn't get THAT hot. Perfectly normal and well within acceptable temps for an Nvidia chip. People in reviews saying ita way too hot or overheating are either not playing on a flat surface or don't know what a truly ""hot"" temp for a video card is. My only gripe with the unit, and it's minor, is the viewing angle on the panel isn't that great and some of the colors are a little washed out. All in all, perfect to acceptable though.I could not be happier with my purchase and if you are looking for an amazing price:performance ratio look no further then this bad boy. After seeing what it can do on WoW i checked out some vids of what the 940MX is capable of and it's really a pleasant surprise what it can handle. GTAV, Overwatch, The Division all at very playable frame rates on medium settings @ 1080. Stop reading and buy it now.",11,13

Upon booting up, first thing I did was removed the included bloatware. I will say though, compared to other vendors, acer has minimal bloatware. Drivers and OS were up to date within 10 minutes. I mainly got this machine to play World of Warcraft on the go, and I gotta say I was literally blown away by the performance this 940mx+HD520 gives. Running @ 1080p with things like AA turned off and ground clutter and particles turned low, most everything else set on medium, I'm getting anywhere from 60-90 fps in the world. I've yet to see frames drop below 45, even in the most populated areas and in dungeons. 90% of the time I'm running 60 fps+. I wasn't expecting this thing to run this well!I can't wait to try out some other games on this, as I've seen benchmarks running GTAV @ 30+ frames.For the price, your not going to find anything better. While the HDD is clearly the bottleneck of this machine, I'll be adding a 512GB M.2 SSD in a few weeks, and that problem will be solved. Also get to keep the 1TB for storage, which is pretty awesome.Even after playing WoW for 4 hours straight, the machine got warm, but remained way under any alarming temps, so long as the bottom is elevated.As far as the trackpad goes... Ive never seen anything so unusable in my life. A mouse is almost required. Half the time it doesn't recognize your finger trying to move the cursor, as it wants more pressure applied. And the other time you have so much pressure applied that your registering a click. And the entire pad can be pressed down to click, so simply moving your finger further up the pad doesn't stop the clicks from registering. I have to remove an egg solely because of how poorly the trackpad functions, otherwise this is a 5 star laptop. Extremely annoying, even when just browsing the web.The screen also is kind of dim, and the colors are far from the best I've seen. But games and movies still look great @ 1080p and at this price range, a lower quality screen should be expected. There's also an HDMI out which will fix this while your at home.All and all, I'm extremely happy with this purchase. I'm glad I did my research on this machine, and if your here, your on the right path!",6,7

It doesn't matter If you are internet browsing, running a small app, a large game or just booting up; this thing takes FOR-E-VER. Mouse clicks constantly stall it's like Acer gives you a virus preloaded with all the other bloatware. I actually dusted off my old Lenovo T440 and it left this thing in the dust running the same programs (both hilarious and sad).I will say the graphics card is great, After waiting 12 minutes for World of Warcraft to start I was surprised to see how beautiful it looked, of course that is when it wasn't suffering from constant lag and flat out freezing up. I have to say I'm pretty disappointed that Acer would even put this machine out knowing how slow it was, the premium processor and graphics card doesn't mean squat if the HDD cant handle the lightest of tasks. Will be returning.",2,14

The SSD ran like a charm, the processor didn't bottleneck the speed so it ran flawlessly with an average 10 second boot time. The 1tb that came with it is now in a caddy I bought from another site where im just gonna store my mass storage files on. All in all, great buy! Have no idea what everybody's complaining about.I also notice the E5-575G-53VG counterpart to this on another site that is slightly newer is loved by thousands of reviews even though on paper, it seems the difference is the 256 SSD and backlit keyboard, but once you buy a 500gb ssd from newegg and put it in this laptop, it becomes even better for less the price -  so it threw me off a bit when the reviews were so different, but I'm glad I bought this one and upgraded it.",5,5
9SIAC8859G1819,34-315-422,9/14/2016 8:10:39 PM,Mohammad A.,Budget gaming made easy.,5," I got this while having a main desktop setup for my main gaming needs, this laptop is meant to do quick gaming on the go while also being suitable for my college work.  This is a budget laptop, make no mistake that cuts had to be made, but what makes this laptop worthy of five stars in my opinion?  Well here is the quick rundown:Dedicated graphics that are above a lot of other offerings at a similar price range, this packs GDDR5 which helps immensely, I ran World of Warcraft and got anywhere from 40-60fps, I could get more if I lowered the res as this was at 1080p and with plenty of options ticked on.  It handles Overwatch at 1080p, medium and texture scaling to 75% and bring home 50-60fps, at this price you won't find this kind of performance.Intel i5U, even though this is not a high end processor, it does get any daily tasks done, including normal gaming.8GB of ram is DDR4!It is generally lightweight for it's size, build quality is also above average but not spectacular, the plastic is a nice finish and the wrist area is this fake metallic kind, it looks low key and is tasteful. 1080p screen at this price can be hard to find, even in 2016."," Despite giving it five stars, there are minor points to consider but none that I was not aware of previously.  They are nothing major in my book.The graphics card, yes it was a pro with it being with GDDR5 but it's memory bandwidth is only 64bit, meaning gaming on it's native res of 1080p can be straining it, however if you tone the res to 900p or 768p, you will be golden to add some extra details that you would otherwise not get.  The 1080p screen is average at best, viewing angles are okay, colors are not as vibrant but not bad by any means.  The keyboard is not back-lit, I knew this beforehand but worth pointing out.The 1TB drive is the 5200rpm type, so be prepared for some loading wait times.The USB ports on the left side are VERY close together, having two devices plugged in at the same time will be a challenge, if possible at all."," I always mentioned that at this price range that this laptop is hard to beat, I got this for $450, free shipping and got it just over 24 hours later (Amazing but it shipped from next door, IL to OH, so your times will vary).This is a budget gaming laptop, and I welcome the performance that I got for my dollars.  Looking around at the price range, you won't find anything with similar specs, considering the CPU is among the newest, 6th gen.  The  GPU is quite a rarity among the sea of 840M/940M's which are DDR3 and common in this price range and even above it.  The laptop's cooling is decent and not loud at all when gaming, battery life seems to be good, at least 3 hour for browsing and the likes (will update if note otherwise). I am happy with my purchase, and will recommend this to anyone who needs the advantage of a graphics card to play some games on the go.",3,4

I had expected the entire process to consume about an hour of my time.. Well be ready to spend half a day cleaning the bloatware to create your recovery image, taking apart the plastic casing delicately, and finally imaging the laptop.Adding up my personal time loss, it would be cheaper and a better value to go with a different manufacturer.

Great Linux machine.,5," Windows worked about as I expected it to; slow to boot up, bogged down by Acer bloatware.  I can't comment much on the Windows performance other than that, because I got rid of it pretty fast.  Arch Linux installed smoothly, and so far everything works just fine, including Optimus graphics card switching via bumblebee.  The dedicated GeForce 940MX is quite robust too.  I haven't tried any serious gaming yet, but Steam installed just fine (with the multilib repositories), and dolphin-emu ran Windwaker and Xenoblade Chronicles without much of a hiccup."," Nothing really, yet.  The viewing angle of the screen is perhaps a little smaller than I'd prefer, but it's pretty acceptable to me."," The two biggest complaints I'd heard about the recent Aspires were about the screen and the downward-facing speakers.  Though the viewing angle on the screen is a bit small, I find the brightness and the contrast to be just fine.  I was pretty hesitant about the speakers, but they haven't bothered me at all.The EFI firmware is a bit silly, but ultimately works just fine.  After making an EFI system partition, mounting it to /boot and installing grub, the firmware couldn't find the boot loader at /boot/EFI/grub/grubx64.efi.  Moving/renaming it to /boot/EFI/boot/bootx64.efi fixed the problem.",6,7

The Linux compatibility is annoying, but not really a show stopper, as I have become accustomed to dealing with Linux over the years.

Track pad is good.," Year into ownership, overheating has started to occur. Have reformatted the hard drive, went up and down win 10 back to 8. (in the process lost a driver for my audio and speakers now sound like tin cans haha) perhaps just nature of the beast. Bummer though, what little performance I squeezed out before (which was pretty good 60 fps at reduced settings, so playable.) now drops to 20 and even 9 today, an all time low. Real hot. Bummer."," All in all still would buy again but is more of an excellent multimedia laptop than gaming rig, though for the price you can sneak some games in and be okay. At least I got a year out of it, now I'll just limp along till I build or buy something else.",1,1

For the price, this system comes with some pretty decent hardware.

The headphone jack is one of the headphone/microphone combos which is perfect for my ear buds. The APU is fantastic, plenty of ram and windows finally fixed the brightness controls.

Support absolutely no help!   I did know the hard drive was only 5400rpm but thought to upgrade to SSD.The only way to access anything, even the BATTERY, is to completely disassemble it.  Battery is not user replaceable.  No access panels to ram, hard drive or wireless.  To open the laptop to replace their sub par components will void the warranty per Asus tech support.  There is no reason to return it to have the battery replaced.  It's ridiculous!!! I have been buying Asus products for many years.

After a year of a tablet being my main mobile device, I was very frustrated with lack of multi-tasking, scares apps for development, and even simple things like other browser tabs refreshing the page when you switched to them.  I was ready to go back to an actual laptop, and frankly this laptop wasn’t much more expensive!I actually love the laptop, especially for the price!  I was actually looking for a smaller system for portability, but found it ironic that the smaller ones were more expensive.  In the end, I find I enjoy the extra screen space a lot more than it fitting in my arms or cheap laptop bags.  The display is brilliant and large, the keyboard is spaced well with everything as I expect, and a large trackpad lets me get more precision without sacrificing a full mouse stroke across the screen.The build is much sturdier than I expected.  It’s cheap, but the power is coming from the simplicity.  The keyboard, power button, and trackpad are all one piece - no creeking border around the keyboard or trackpad, no top cover for buttons or speakers to snap off before you can unscrew the keyboard.  The screen folds down on two hinges that doesn’t feel loose or flimsy, and there’s no locking/unfolding latch or mechanism simply because it doesn’t seem to need it.  It even folds open about 135°, which is comfortable enough for me to use on a desk while standing.  The viewing angle still has a noticable impact on brightness/color, but not as much as other laptops I’ve used.People seem to be knocking it for having to ""take apart the whole thing to get anywhere.""  While this is true, it's stupid-easy to do!  There's 9 perimeter screws, and the top portion pops off with a few simple snaps.  There's 3 easy-release ribbon cables for keyboard, trackpad, and power button if you want to remove it completely.  After that, everything is extremely accessible!  If you have a screwdriver handy, you can still swap out battery, RAM, HDD, and media drive in under 5 minutes!  Yet, I can still press and squeeze anywhere and there's no creaking or excessive give.  The more I think about this simple 2-piece (3 if you include the screen) design, the more I love it.I installed a Radeon R7 SSD, get about 200MB/s <0.1ms access, and now the laptop blazing fast!  It’s not a gaming laptop, nor is it meant for heavy tasks, but I’m definitely able to have dozens of tabs open and 8 different applications open at the same time (so long as nothing's CPU intensive, which most stuff isn't). It’s impressively quiet, even when it had the Seagate 5000RPM in there.  It doesn't get hot even at full stress, and it's actually comfortable on my lap."," Most of the stuff I want to complain about isn’t the laptop’s fault.  I read the product description, and I know what features it’s missing.  Most everything else I find difficult with using it is Windows 8, but I could downgrade (or use Win 10 technical preview) if I wasn’t insistent on learning it so as to not fall behind on tech anymore than I already am.  I really wish they didn’t follow the users-can’t-change-out-batteries-from-our-products-because-it-confuses-them trend mobile devices started doing in recent years.  That was an insult, but everyone seems to be doing it so it’s not a specific fault to this laptop.  I guess I can't recall ever regularly changing out laptop batteries, and it's not really that had to get to, so this is a minor gripe.  However, one large item that’s definitely knocking off at least one egg is quality control.  It’s a good thing I planned on upgrading the HDD!  It was held in with one loose screw which had no loc-tite (2 screw holes were empty, and the 4th double as a chassis thru-screw)!  The plastic backing that prevents the HDD controller components from shorting on the chassis, and the foam spacers along the mainboard, all looked like they were stuck on by a drunk blind person who really didn’t care!  All the components worked when it got here, and it looked pretty from the outside, but this shoddy job of putting the insides together makes me not want to buy ASUS again.  If you’re proficient with computers, take the 60 seconds (literally) it takes to pop this guy open and give it the visual inspection a Quality Assurance team never did."," This was strike 3 from ASUS, a company I used to be a die-hard fan of!  My ASUS tablet died within its warranty period, so I email them, but they never got back to me (I wasn’t too bothered as I was replacing it with this laptop anyway).  A router of their also died on me, but that was the first defective device and I thought “eh, everyone makes mistakes”.  It’s a shame because I used to build desktop gaming systems, and would prefer ASUS for overclocking and never had one die!  But, it seems you only get ASUS quality if you also pay top-dollar for their enthusiast products…  Shame on you, ASUS.  This is a wonderfully engineered laptop, but you’re cutting corners to meet that bottom price.(I assume this was ASUS’s fault because I purchased this laptop as “Open Box” and not “Refurbished”.  I suppose there is a chance the faults are of someone who refurbished the laptop, but in that case shame on whoever refurbished it, and Newegg for not labelling it correctly.)In the end, I’m very happy with the laptop!",None,None

The processor is not very powerful but at this price, that is to be expected."," Remember, this is a Celeron processor. It is no Core i3, i5, or i7. I should have done this before I bought the laptop, but I compared processors between this Asus and my old 2009 Dell Inspiron 1525 on a benchmark website. The Pentium in the old Dell ranked slightly above the Celeron in the Acer. Ouch. But, you get what you pay for. If I had to do it over again, I might have spent a little more for a better processor. That being said, it's a decent laptop for the price and it will probably do OK for what we use it for, which is basically just surfing, email, netflix, etc. I can't comment on the reliability yet because I've only had it a few days.

Now it is designated as a desktop. So being a student i needed something to carry to class, and being on a budget i was on the market for something in the 200-300 range. I originally intended on getting a chrome book and running a linux distro on it for development. After looking around and really thinking about it i realized for development a chromebook might not be the best choice. I wanted more space, more memory, a larger keyboard, and So i chose to go with windows. I narrowed it down to this asus, a dell, and a acer all in the same price range, same cpu, same specs. I decided to go with the asus because of their lower failure rate, customer service, and the warranty, also friends also recommended the brand. So far, i am very satisfied with my choice. No crashes, smooth, snappy, responsive. The intel n2830 celeron dual core, is a good chip for the price. I did have to get used to it though. Im a guy who likes and is used to, everything opened, and a hundred tabs, but im also used to my i7 cpu lol. That will not happen with this machine. IT WILL BOG DOWN. With a modest number of application open it will still perform. All my IDEs, the xampp servers, and other tools run great on it. There is no optical drive, but that is not a concern to me. I cant remember the last time i used one. Google docs that i use often can sometimes not be so responsive, especially when there are more than 5 tabs open, you just have to remember to keep your tabs down.For what it is ( a machine for less than $300) it is a great machine, that real work can be done on. I have had a good experience with it, and it has helped me through college when i was on a bugdet. If you just want to browse the web, facebook, type notes, watch youtube, i would recomend a chromebook, but If you requirements are simular to mine, i really recomend this machine.",4,4

Terrible product and terrible service.  Do not trust the manufacturer warranty or their service center or New Egg to help at all during first year if problems arise. LESSON LEARNED:  Do not buy ASUS products and Do Not buy from New Egg," This product was flawed from the get go when bought last December.  We tried to live through the weekly and biweekly blue and black screens until they became daily.  We bought the 2 year New egg warranty but found out that it only kicks in AFTER the first year of the ASUS warranty.  Lots of time on phone with ASUS tech support having us download new drivers and much more.  Problem continued and then got worse.  Finally sent in on RMA to be repaired in August.  Problem was with ""bad Pool Call"" error message with no code.  ASUS on phone said it was display related and that they would replace our display.  Instead, after shipping off computer to repair center (at our cost of $16.25 for packaging), repair center put in new power supply and did nothing to fix problem.  After receiving unit back in August, it seemed to work for the first week and then started doing the same thing.  We again tried to live with it but it has now become a daily ordeal of multiple reboots after multiple blue and black screens.  Called ASUS back and demanded new computer.  They refused.  We have to send back at another cost of $16.45 now to have the same repair shop in California (we live in Washington) try to fix the problem they were supposed to have fixed the first time.  ASUS Customer Service does not care (third party call center) and will not do anything other than force an expensive and time consuming RMA every time."," DO NOT buy ASUS - go with Dell,  HP or other reliable serviceBuy locally so you can get service locallyNew Egg was useless with our problems once they had our money.

9SIA8X53HT2140,34-232-848,1/23/2016 1:34:35 PM,Anonymous,"Great hardware, hampered by a few things.  Still an excellent buy for a gamer.",4," I previously bought ASUS before and was highly impressed with the hardware at the time, and was basically a standard-use oriented version of this.  Having my focus shift to higher quality gaming, I decided to pick this up since it offers great performance for the price, while being an improvement over my previous laptop.- Excellent processor,  Similar to my old one, but two generations more advanced and more powerful in the process.  Capable of handling any regular work with ease and can destroy most modern games at high quality.- Great GPU.  The model is a GDDR5 960M which gives it improved performance over a non GDDR5 card.  I have not played many games as of yet but it can handle Elite Dangerous at 60FPS on max settings at 1080P.  Bulky, graphically loaded ""AAA"" titles are likely to give you a challenge however, depending on the optimization.-RAM is serviceable and upgradable.  8GB is great, as most games tend not to go over 60% of my RAM usage if they're older or less intensive.  -1TB HDD space means I can store pretty much anything I personally need.  Usually I just carry games, and not a lot of media, so it's perfect for me.  -USB 3.0 on all ports."," Two major issues so far.  Let's get the easy one out of the way.1: 5400RPM HDD.  I was honestly pretty surprised and even a little upset that in 2015 5400RPM is still the norm for computers.  For practical purposes, this computer actually responds and works slower than my previous laptop (5 years older with a similar processor for the time) which had a 7200RPM HDD that was half full, with half the capacity.  Things like alt tabbing, logging in, opening up a big program, putting the computer to sleep have a delay, that while might not bother most people, is a nuisance to me, especially since I'm used to the speed I had the past 5 years.  Consider upgrading to a 7200RPM HDD or an SSD/HDD Hybrid to get the most out of the rest of your hardware.!!! Also, the laptop HDD was making small noises right out of the box as it was working and continues to do so.  I can also hear it when I sleep the computer.  After a few moments of powering down, it sounds like someone was applying breaks (gently) to the spinning part itself, which made me worried.  I am NOT certain if any of this audible HDD noise is normal because none of my computers the past decade has made audible, small clicks when they operate.  I have not experienced any lower performance than normal however.  2:  The big one.  Windows 10.  I won't spend too much time on it because it has less to do with the hardware and more to do with the software, and ultimately doesn't affect gaming experience.  However, it does affect user experience to a good degree.  Coming from W7, W10 has a lot of things that are unintuitive and obtuse.  For someone who likes to get the most of his performance, trying to disable certain programs while in admin mode then told it's not possible for some unknown reason is frustrating.  Forced anti-malware takes up far more RAM then necessary and frequently hogs my disk usage, taxing the 5400 RPM HDD even more.  It took a user regedit to disable that. Quite a few apps kept reinstalling themselves as well until a powershell command knocked most of them out.  W10's lock screen can't even be changed.  Basically, there are a lot of things that make me wonder how they got past the Q&A team. Not asus' fault, but an issue none the less.  Minor things1.  Laptop aluminum warms quickly when gaming, but is not hot.  Simply uncomfortable.  Computer runs cool though, despite the feeling.2.  Charger length is shorter than before, making it more of a hassle if you're moving around.3.  Microphone seems to have problems with sensitivity and struggles to pick my voice up over skype.  4.  Battery life might be fairly short, reducing practicality outside a static location.  "," Conclusions and NotesFor those who are primarily focused on gaming, but don't want to spend over a thousand dollars?  This is fantastic value.  ASUS hardware has always been reliable for me and powerful throughout the years.  However, as far as everyday practicality goes, this one is actually worse than my older laptop due to the poor software lessened battery life, which is ultimately disappointing after 5 years, regardless of being a gaming laptop.",1,1

This performance combined with it's highly competitive price made it an easy choice. -i7 4720HQ is awesome and very quick, despite being an older processor-Easy to remove bloatware-Back-lit keyboard w/ multiple intensity settings-960m is great for the games I play (war thunder, GTAV, Just cause 3...)-optical drive is a nice touch, I'm kind of old school when it comes to this-very nice texture to the keyboard surface -1920x1080!-upgradable RAM, although to be honest 8GB is probably plenty for what I do"," -track pad is the absolute WORST I've ever used (but I use a gaming mouse anyway, so who cares...)-as others have said, outer shell is a fingerprint magnet -the single large HDD came partitioned into two separate drives...which was kind of strange to me and seemed unnecessary"," I'm not a mobile gamer by any means. My main rig has a GPU and CPU watercooled loop (5930k and GTX980), so needless to say my expectations for my new laptop were very low.

9SIA8X53HT2140,34-232-848,1/1/2016 4:59:17 AM,charles s.,Friendly and Tame,4," Not a racing hybrid, but it's got moderate power, something like comparing a stock V8 to so many other 4 and 6 cylinders. Also, there's a separate gfx card which I haven't tried out yet (you may consider whether or not you really need one). It is something a lot of new machines don't have and don't need with everyday use. I intend to use this thing for both, but if I need the extra power for an occasional game or something, I expect it to deliver."," Asus may should have done a little more on this machine as far as readying it for windows-10. I spent probably 5 hours or more, tinkering with this and that to get this thing up to speed: at one time, my entire file folder system quit working--I had to go into safe mode and re-set settings and run a registry checker. And there were a couple of times that the machine simply wouldn't start up at all--I had to wait, then hold the button for 5 seconds, to force it into a restart. I had difficulties installing a Logitech mouse driver that I had. All these may be the fault of a clash between windows 10 and Asus's hardware drivers--but that doesn't make you feel any better when you're spending many hours on Christmas day trying to get your machine running--and wondering if you'll have to send the thing back. Thankfully, the conflicts seem to have sorted themselves out (I hope it stays peaceful!). And let's talk about heat. Mine often runs 120 - 135 F using only moderate resources and I think that's a bit high for an i7 processor (some more expert than me, speak up). I am using a lap-cooler as well. My other asus machine, with an i5 processor, runs about the same temp--or less--when running the same (fallout 4!) video on youtube. I kind of expected this machine to perhaps strain itself less, clock-wise. If you've got this same machine and it is using a lot of exclusive cycles for something like a major windows update in the background, then you can expect your machine to run pretty warm--up into the 140's or higher--that's at something like 30% of total power. Like I say, I expected this V8 to run a little smoother and easier--and I haven't even put it through its paces yet as far as playing a new generation game set on high FPS settings--we'll see. I suppose if you want an exclusive gaming system, you might be better off with a liquid cooled desktop setup--and more money shelled out."," Finally, I'd say that apart from the above nitpicking, the machine now seems good for the price and I've settled into a 'comfort stage' with it. I'd recommend it to someone but tell them about some of the issues I had. This is the 2nd asus I've had and the good points and not so good points are true for both of them--I really can't complain too much as I've had other computers (::cough cough, HP & IBM), that gave me far more problems. In this day and age of quick-to-the-market hardware, there is the necessity of just-as-quickly-written software for the drivers--some computer manufacturers may handle change better than others as far as driver and operating system clashes--I just wish asus could have done a little better here. Otherwise like I say, for the money I'm comfortable with it now.",1,1

Even though it is amazing as a laptop, it is facing terrible problems when gaming that I have been unable to fix. In every game I have tried, even though the GPU seems to work fine and its running at 60 fps, I face a very high amount of stuttering and screen tearing when I look around or move around in general. I am sure it's not the mouse's problem because this also happens with the touchpad. This makes most games unplayable. The stuttering does not have any impact on the fps. I have tried different NVIDIA drivers as well as making clean installations, I have tried updating and reinstalling the keyboard and mouse drivers, I've tried to see if maybe it is the DPC latency but none of these seem to fix the problem. I am therefore very dissatisfied since this is happening at all games, even from 7 years ago and in low settings which have run flawlessly on older and much weaker laptops.",1,7

9SIA8X53HT2140,34-232-848,12/19/2015 9:53:44 AM,LILY W.,Possible minor issue?,4," Very good at noise reduction. The fan doesn't make that much noise either even when I'm gaming. Screen resolution is so clear. This laptop is a huge upgrade from what I previously had. Runs all of my games very smoothly and allows me to optimize the games to the high settings. (The games I mostly play: WoW, FFXIV, ESO, GW2)"," Back to the noise reduction, maybe it's just too good, or perhaps this is a fault with just only the laptop I received. I checked all my microphone settings and even brought in my tech savvy friends to help troubleshoot. All settings are turned up in my computer and for skype, but I can't be heard talking in a normal tone. When I plug in a headset, I literally have to yell to be heard. I used the same headset for my previous laptop and worked just fine. But with this laptop, the mic has to be right at my mouth or in it for people to hear me. Without the headset, the laptop has to be tilted too close to my face to be heard and with how far it's tilted, I can't even see my screen. And yes, I'm sitting as close to the laptop as I possibly can. Even with my dad karaoking on the opposite side of the wall, they can't hear him like they usually do, which I guess is a perk for them. But I'm at a loss for whether the my laptop's microphone is faulty or working as intended.",,1,1

9SIA8X53HT2140,34-232-848,12/15/2015 4:54:23 PM,Bradley N.,Great buy!,5," Powerful, but not a budget buster. Great, sturdy design. Decent screen, lightning fast."," The laptop can get pretty warm, but it is not much of a problem as it seems to cool down pretty quickly."," This laptop is an amazing deal, the power you get for the price you pay is the main reason why I chose this model. I didn't have a terribly large budget for a laptop, and I wanted something powerful enough for most newer games, but it had to be affordable too. Laptops with comparable specs were often several hundred dollars more expensive. I definitely got what I was looking for with this buy.I have had this laptop for about a month now, and so far it performs well with most newer games. Windows boots and is usable in just 18 seconds and it loads everything quickly. The only time I noticed it slow down was while I was downloading and installing games via Steam and Origin. It runs Battlefield 3 on Ultra with no issues which it should, considering the game is several years old already. Battlefield 4 runs on high at around 40 FPS but slows down when things get very intense. It was not terribly bad, but it was noticeable. Total War:Rome II runs on Ultra settings and Total War: Attila runs on high settings flawlessly; It struggles during massive battles but that may also be due to game limitations. Overall, I am very pleased with this laptops performance and it is an excellent balance between graphics and affordability.If you don't need max graphics, but still want good visuals, and cannot afford a high end model, I would definitely recommend this laptop!",2,2

In the end, I enabled my SSID broadcast and it connected well.Until now I haven't had any problems be it overheating or speed.

9SIA8X53HT2140,34-232-848,12/11/2015 6:38:59 AM,Nicholas C.,Exceeded my expectations,4," i7, Price$$, 960m NVIDIA graphics card, Dedicated card, mini sata cache slot, speed (after upgrade), backlit keyboard, 3.0 USB, 16gb max ram, ASUS QualityGetting an i7 processor, 960m NVIDIA, and other included specs make this an amazing bang for your buck entry level laptop. The design and overall quality is very durable and feels like it was well built. I wont go into Pros as much as Cons because they're pretty self explanatory. It's fast, handles the games I play on the highest settings, quiet, durable, and very eye appealing."," Keyboard; This is one of two reasons why I give it 4/5 stars. I haven't heard of anyone else complaining about this problem so I think I just got a faulty laptop that'll have to send back for replacement or repair unless i can find my own fix. When I first boot up or wake up my laptop, keys A S D F J K will not respond for a good couple minutes and I cant sign in. After those few minutes though, they work perfectly until I shut down or put my laptop to sleep again.  Pretty strange.. you would think they would either work or not work, not just stall out and not respond for a couple minutes.Heat conduction;  This is the only other major problem I have with the laptop. I dont play any high demanding games (Diablo3, Left4Dead2,Steam games) and after only 10 minutes my laptop is already at 70c (I use MSI Afterburner to test). I don't see any changes to game play or performance (throttling), but around the vent the laptop gets pretty hot in a very short time and this is with using a cooling pad at all times!Screen; The screen is not as high quality as I expected. If you read professional reviews of this laptop this was their biggest problem, it's just a terrible TN screen. There's a few tweeks you can do to improve it, but definitely stick with 1920x1080 resolution. I've bought HP laptops all my life and my previous one was a 17' with the best screen I've ever seen. I almost prefer to watch blue rays on my old HP rather than my brand new 50"" Sony Bravia. So this was a disappointment when I first used the laptop. I'm not saying it's horrible, I just expected better for a gaming laptop. It's an entry level laptop so I'm not too upset about it. Function keys; I do not like the layout of the keys. It drives me nuts that I cant just push volume up or volume down by themselves. You have to use function then volume to adjust the sound. Its a minor problem, but it annoys me, I've never had a laptop that you have to use a function key to adjust the volume.Number pad; Also going along with the layout of the keyboard. The number pad on the far right is just squished in there and is awkward to use. On all other number pads the 0 is in the middle under all the numbers and on the GL551 its on the bottom off to the side with other random keys around it, so whenever I use it I have to be looking at what keys im using instead of knowing the layout by heart and not having to look at it like normal keyboards. Once again, just a minor problem that bugs me, nothing major, just a weird layout."," I've owned this laptop for about 3 weeks now and I figured it was time to give it a review. I've been nothing but impressed with this entry level gaming laptop for the most part. Even though I listed a lot more Cons than Pros I highly recommend this laptop for its exceptional price (I got it a week before cyber Monday and price matched it for $729).First of all let me give you a suggestion as to what I did. After ordering the laptop, I immediately ordered a SAMSUNG EVO 850 2.5"" 250gb SSD to upgrade the slow 5400 RPM HDD. Also, as soon as I got it I opened it up and looked at the RAM stick so I could get an exact copy. After receiving both, I cloned my hard drive to the new ssd in an hour and 45 minutes and put in the second ram stick so I could run 16gb dual channel memory. All i can say is WOW! My laptop boots up and is ready to use in less then 10 secs, no joke. I HIGHLY recommend that you do the same upgrade. For Samsung Evo SSD($79) and Hynix 8gb ram($47) I literally turned this laptop into something you would expect out of a $1500+ gaming laptop. It is crazy fast with absolutely no lag. It handles everything I throw at it with ease and I'm extremely happy with it after the upgrades. I really hope this keyboard issue goes away so I don't have to be without it for a few weeks while it's getting repaired. All in all, if you're wanting something that will work with newer games on high-ish settings and have under $1000 budget, stick with ASUS and get this little beast.  From what I've read in reviews and forums,no one really has anything bad to say about the GL551 besides the TN screen and heat conduction. When you do purchase this, make sure you have a cooling pad just to be safe and upgrade to and ssd and additional stick of ram you will be very pleased. I almost feel guilty giving it 4/5 stars and not 5/5, but would have done so If not for my keyboard issue.",9,9
9SIA8X53HT2140,34-232-848,12/8/2015 11:57:21 PM,Albert J.,Best Laptop I ever had,4," Let me first start out by saying I'm not that computer savvy, I know basics and because of google I know a lot more now. I more or less a casual gamer but the time I do spend gaming I like to enjoy it as much as I can. So lets get into the pros.The laptop runs like a dream with 8 gigs or ram, I play a lot of mobas and find myself constantly on twitch, the machine accommodates both with gusto. The video card and processor or great for the price and the laptop starts within seconds.The keyboard and touch pad are responsive and the machine on the whole feels like it was made with quality in mind.The Bluetooth feature is a nice touch and if you're like me you've already purchased a comparable Bluetooth speaker so the internal laptop features aren't really much of a problem.Its quite light from whats I was expecting and the screen is ample without making the laptop itself cumbersome.There isn't enough junk installed or it some the only annoying reminders you'll have to deal with is them reminding you to register your laptop.I've yet to experience any cooling issues and I've been on it up to 8 hours in one sitting. Lastly I went with this one because Asus is a brand I've been appreciating for quite sometime. They don't disappoint with this incarnation of greatness either. On a personal note the battery is removable with makes everything a lot more manageable if something was to go awry.", I only have a few and none are worth more than I glance.The lid is a finger print magnet.There's no light to indicate whether the caps lock or num lock is on (or off) accidentally.The cooling fan placement is a bit strange for my tastes its on the left side and being left handed I place everything on that side and you might be able to warm a cup of cold coffee if you play long enough.Oh and the Ethernet insert is a bit stiff and difficult to deal with if you enjoy a stronger connection with you play online games.," This laptop is well made, and operates like a dream. I chose this over another choice because I believe in the brand. Buy it! it's worth the price.",3,3

There are only two things I recommend upgrading.- Hard drive- RamThe hard drive is only 5400 RPM, which can be slow at times. I would recommend upgrading to a 7200 RPM, SSHD, or an SSD. It increases load times by a lot. As for the ram, its ok. However I feel more confident having 16gb of ram for video editing and other things."," Overall, this laptop is a great laptop for anyone who is on a budget and wants to get into PC gaming, or just wants to have something portable. The laptop has handled everything I have thrown at it so far, I can play all of the games I play on my desktop without a problem. Overall a really nice buy.",4,4

9SIA8X53HT2140,34-232-848,12/3/2015 1:49:39 PM,Justin G.,Very Happy With It,5," Quiet Operation, Heat Management seems great (it doesn't seem to get hot at all for me, even under heavy processor load) comfortable to type on."," Because it is a brushed aluminum top, it does get fingerprint smudges on it easily, but this is truly a VERY small nit-pick, and not a big deal in the greater scheme of things. The only reason I'm even putting it here is because it is quite literally the only thing I can think of that is ""problematic"" with it."," I have been eyeing this laptop for, literally, months. As I have had a professional career in IT for over 15 years, I knew that, for myself, I was going to need a machine with a dedicated graphics processor, and wanting to keep the cost down, this machine seemed like it would fit the bill. I was willing to pay $1100 for the 2014 version with 16GB of RAM and Win 8.1. As such, I was VERY happy to see the newer, redesigned version for a few hundred less. I paid an additional 40 bucks, installed a secondary 8GB memory chip myself, and basically got a 2015 version of something I was willing to pay a lot more for. I was initially kicking myself for not getting the SSD, but the thing boots to my login screen in about 11 seconds. Word, Excel, even Photoshop and Lightroom open FAST, so I don't know that the SSD is absolutely necessary, but if you are a hardcore computer gamer (I am not,) I can understand the desire for it. Granted, I have only had it for a week, but so far, the thing is a rockstar performer, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a power user. It might be considered to be an ""entry level"" gaming machine, but for me, its anything but.",5,5

Very impressed.Tip: If you're having trouble running GTA or any game that is graphically demanding, I suggest configuring the settings in the Intel Graphics and NVIDIA Control Panel  to maximize performance.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvwCmT6P1mUAnother pro is definitely the aesthetics, I mean this thing is gorgeous, the backlit keyboard, Republic of Gamers logo behind the screen lights up as well. Sleek and sexy design overall, I get compliments whenever I whip it out at school, at friend's place, and at family occasions."," Considering it came with 1TB HDD (5400 RPM, unfortunately). I would suggest upgrading to an SSD if you have the money to spend, it will definitely increase boot up time and any other programs that involves photo/video editing.It's only 8GB RAM, I understand that's probably enough for a few users out there but for myself, I consider myself a speed freak (like I mentioned below, GET AN SSD), and definitely looking towards 16GB sometime soon.It may heat up if you like heavy gaming on this laptop, I suggest getting a cooling pad from Corsair, definitely makes a difference between temps.I don't know if this bothers anyone, but the audio/mic input is all-in-one. I have a headset that involves a separate audio and mic jack (splitter cable), and I'm just not sure how this works. Most laptops in my past came with the separate headphone input and microphone input. Nonetheless, there are some splitter cable adapters online for sale. Just sucks how I would have spend another $5-$10 for a really small adapter for my headset."," Overall, I really enjoy this laptop. Although I do have a custom built gaming pc, I sometimes like to use the laptop to play casual games like GTA and Batman Arkham City with the XBOX 360 controller of course.Definitely an awesome laptop for school work or something other than gaming related on the go.

It seems very well constructed and very modern. After opening this I immediately replaced the 5400RPM HDD to a PNY 240GB SSD. The biggest issue when upgrading: the laptop has no product key on the bottom for Windows 10. However, there are recovery/backup tools you can use, or there are tools to see your product key. For a recovery you will likely require at least 33.5GB of space on an external/thumb drive. I used Macrium Reflect (freeware), but the downside was I lost the recovery partition (not necessary, so I created a recovery image to store elsewhere after the swap). There is a panel on the bottom that can be opened by removing two screws, then sliding the cover off. Doing this will expose the HDD, ram, and Wi-Fi card. The HDD is in a caddy, held down by three screws, then four more holding the drive into the caddy. Only one of the two ram slots is in use. The WASD keys all have a red rim to make them easier to identify, and the keyboard is backlit (as well as the ROG logo on the lid). The power button is where the end key is on most keyboards, and leaves the only option for end key being fn+1. The sound is decent, nothing mind-blowing. The screen is exactly as expected for a 15.6 FHD (no UHD/4k).Battery Life: Was determined without changing any power settings, and streaming video from my media server.50% - 3 hours 5 minutes10% - 4 hours 53 minutes0% - 5 hours 19 minutesCharge Time: While in use100% - 2 hours 15 minutesWithout making any changes, the laptop will determine which GPU needs to be used at any given time. I have not seen any issues with this when gaming or otherwise. The only time I needed to manually select the GPU was to run a PassMark for this review. However, you can manually select the GPU in the Nvidia settings through the system tray. There is a bunch of bloatware from Asus, which can all be uninstalled and does not take long at all. Excessive heat has not been a factor, and the only time I even noticed it heating up was when I accidentally covered the heatsink.External Ports:Left - 2 USB 3.0 ports, 1 ethernet, 1 HDMI, 1 Mini Display PortRight - USB 3.0 port, lock slot, DVD-RAM drivePassMark 7.0 Scores (w/ssd & 12GB RAM):Overall: w/integrated graphics - 2,814.6Overall: w/GTX 960M - 3,448.3CPU Mark: 10,161.9The original HDD is an HGST 5K1000-1000 (1TB 5,400RPM). You can search Hitachi Travelstar 5K1000 for more information on the drive. If you have any spare DDR3-1600 sticks laying around you can install them (I had an extra 4gb, thus the 12gb total).

Basically a macbook with windows, I have gotten many complimentsDedicated GPU, more than enough CPU power and Ram.Runs cool, and quiet.All the usb, HDMI, vga plugs etc etc you could need.1TB is enough, and 7200 is about as fast as it gets, doubt anyone can complain about that.Bluetooth.I do not use the webcam but it does have one. LONG battery life, no joke, 6-7 hours with battery saver settings. I thought the charger cable was short at first but hasn’t proved to be an issue yet.Windows 10 is getting very nice, I enjoy using it more and more every day and its stability is getting up there with windows 7."," I have had one issue.  - The audio jack. This was resolved by merely tightening the screws on the bottom of the case. I carry this laptop daily so likely they just wiggled loose. The audio has worked perfectly ever sense. A minor gripe I have is the 'click' of the touch pad is not the sound I would have it make in my dreams, but this can be avoided by simply tapping it to simulate when you want to click."," Okay, so I bought this laptop 6 months ago and I recently returned to look at the specs before I recommended it to someone else and noticed these reviews. I felt OBLIGATED to leave an honest review. I am a senior engineering student/TA and use this laptop for everything, and carry it in my messenger bag daily everywhere I go. I have found that it has held up very well. Everything works the same as the day I bought it. Aside from mentioned above which was a 25 second fix, also I saw in another review that nothing(sans the RAM) is accessible from the bottom of the computer. While this is true, if you look up 'teardown' videos of similar Asus laptops it is insanely simple to remove the keyboard after taking off the bottom screws. I would not be afraid at all if I needed to access the components. I formatted the windows 10 to a fresh version, updated and continue to update it; as far as software goes it is reliable and runs smooth. I often go days putting it into hibernate and it has no issues starting up where I left off time and time again. I guess it is possible that I didn't get a 'lemon' but I have had a great experience with this computer, would buy It again in a heartbeat. If you're buying this for someone or thinking of buying it for similar uses as I've stated I wouldn't hesitate.",12,13

Quality control might need to improve. I waited 13 days for a replacement. The replacement arrived and installed bloatware was removed. Consuming more of my time. After use I had repeatedly gotten the message the image driver is not responding and restarted. After looking around I found I needed to update a driver. This consumes even more time. For a guy that just wanted a regular decent laptop out of the box I didn't get one. Instead I got a computer that needed work from day one.

Then they say I should send it in for repairs, which I was happy to do, but they wanted me to pay shipping for repairs under warranty.... which to me was absurd. After HOURS on the phone they sent me a shipping label. Then finally when the computer arrived at their facility for repairs, I was told would be 3 business days to repair and one day for shipping, the laptop took 2 weeks to repair. ASUS customer service is beyond ridiculous. They will not take any responsibility for their mistakes and put any and all blame on the customer! The trouble is I am moving and sent the unit out 3 weeks in advance to be safe... I even called them to change the delivery address to my new home, which I was told was done. Then come today I find out they changed my account address and not the delivery address. Now it is being shipped to the wrong address and they want me to pay to have it delivered to my new address even though someone on their end messed that up.

Then I installed a beta driver (for windows 10, not 8 like the laptop came with), and it went downhill from there. Every time I put the laptop into sleep mode it would wake up with the screen covered in static. The next day I brought the laptop to class, thinking I could use it temporarily. I stapled some papers, put them on the keys/touchpad area and shut the lid (I didn't think anything of this since I'd done it multiple times with my old laptop). I then put the laptop in a protective case and went to class. When I opened the laptop, there was a tiny crack in the lower right hand corner of the screen (I assumed that the staples did this) and the screen was completely static, and I couldn't start it up/shut it off. But since the laptop had been seriously malfunctioning I decided to send it back. I figured there would be no problem since it was seriously malfunctioning before the screen cracked. However I was completely wrong. I sent the laptop back and waited well over 10 business days to get the money credited back into my account. Just today (I got the email saying they received it back on December 23, saying in 7-10 business days they would credit my acct) I finally got an email saying that they rejected my return and that they're sending the laptop back to me.

Bad formfactor,3, The Skylake processor keeps battery life long lasting and doesn't effect overall power of the system.  Dedicated graphics processor.," Most people who buy from newegg are computer aficionados who want to be able to upgrade their system.  While laptops are not the most up-gradable in terms of processor, memory and hard drive are usually the first to be replaced.  When it comes to a system I know I am going to be using on a regular, I replace the hard drive with a solid state and increase the memory to a minimum of 16GB.  Secondary to that is the wireless card. I try to stick with intel cards are they seem to work the best.  Getting access to these items in this system is difficult as best.  In order to get to the hard drive, you have to take 70% of the computer apart.  To get the the wireless card, you have to removed the motherboard.  Yes remove the motherboard.

I have been looking into a new laptop for a few months now after my last one decided it was thirsty and attempted to drink water. That didn't work out too well. So, after looking for months I came across this laptop and for around $200 less than what I was willing to spend on a new laptop. I really only had two demands, not a Dell and it had to have dedicated graphics and this hit both of those requirements.Pros:Dedicated graphics. Keep in mind that this card is mid range. You will be able to play most everything on medium to low graphics. I was ok with this since I can still play the games! I also have a desktop that is mostly for gaming.Plenty of RAM. Comes with 8gb which is plenty for the everyday user, especially if you aren't planning on doing anything too demanding.i5 processor. No it's not an i7 but honestly I am more than OK with that. My last laptop had an i7 in it and was a battery HOG. This thing has the same power, maybe more, and is very battery friendly. Furthermore, you are getting the brand new Skylake.CD Drive. This is honestly a pro for anyone. If you use CD's frequently then it is great for you. If you never use CD's then its perfect too.  You can various caddies that WILL fit this drive. So if you wanted to you can always add an SSD.7200 RPM HDD. I noticed one guy post that this laptop is held back by a 5400 rpm drive. I think he got a wrong HDD or something. Mine came with a 7200 rpm drive and that is what is advertised with this laptop.Number pad: Wide enough to hold a number pad which I enjoy. Not a huge deal but still nice to have.Display: The display on this laptop is pretty amazing. Very sharp and crisp, better than my old laptop actually.Please keep in mind that my old laptop was a Sony Vaio that was around $850. It only had 4gb of ram and a lower end i7. So for $200 less I get more RAM and a better processor, better battery life and a graphics card that is equal to what I use to have.Also note: Some peoples one egg reviews kinda throw me off on this. For instance, one person complains that it freezes up and hangs; this is more than likely a bad hard drive or something and it can easily be returned and they will gladly replace it. Remember guys, when reading reviews be sure to actually read why someone gave it one egg and use self judgment to determine if it really deserved that review."," Touch pad. Honestly, I don't blame the laptop itself though. I really don't like touch pads and never have. This would be why I have a wireless mouse always ready to go."," If you are debating on getting this laptop, just get it.

Unless you strike the keys dead center and with just the right amount of force it won't register and you'll constantly need to go back and fix mistakes.

9SIA0AJ3Z89988,34-319-445,9/11/2015 1:43:30 PM,Elton W.,A good desktop replacement,3," Despite the ""low price"", the machine has a solid build, and is relatively thin and lightweight for its size. The owner can easily modify it (additional memory. replace hard disk, etc) since the Owner's manual provides clear illustrations and information. The 4 Gb RAM is ""ample"", but I added an additional 8 Gb, to the second (empty) slot.One can also install Linux to the machine as dual-boot, without the need to disable Secure Boot. CAVEAT: the Realtek / Qualcomm / Atheros internal modem does not work in linux, but support is forthcoming in a future kernel.The deceptively ""skinny"" battery provides quite a long time of  usage before one needs to recharge. (Sorry, I didn't measure the exact time, but I'd say a good three hours or so).The island-style keyboard provides just the right resistance to the touch, and the clip on the network port ensures that the cable cannot easily disconnect."," My main disappointment is that the wifi card does not work in linux. However, bluetooth does. Also, since the keyboard is black, one unintentionally tends to hit  the keys on the numeric pad. I would have preferred if there were a clearly visible (or tactile) demarcation between the numeric pad and the rest of the keyboard.  Instead of the standard round connector (to plug IN) the power cord, there's a proprietary oblong connector which resembles a usb plug. However it is *not*, nor should you attempt to use a usb cable in place of this power cord."," You can connect in linux by: waiting for kernel 43, replacing the internal wifi card from a different manufacturer, or using a network cable directly connected to a modem. If you happen to have a network cable where the small clip is damaged, you can use that end to insert into the machine, since the onboard clip will keep the cable secured. HDMI connectivity works (in Linux, start at a low resolution, and once connected to the external display, you gradually increase the resolution). Despite the plastic casing, the machine still feels like a ""quality build"". It would have been nice if this product were available in (say) off white. Since the keyboard is *not* backlit, I would recommend sticking a very thin line of light-coloured tape to demarcate between the main keyboard and the numeric pad. Of course, you would need a small light if the machine is used in a darkened location.Overall, this is a very good buy, well balanced between price and quality.",None,None

This laptop has lots of features and decent performance - even some light gaming capability. Overall a great value for anyone on a budget. The construction seems to be good quality, and it comes with name brand components - Samsung memory stick and a Seagate HDD. It is very easy to replace the memory and hard drive. Simply remove the battery ( no screws, just latches to unlock/pop it out) and unscrew 3 small screws to be able to remove the back cover. The layout is very clean and the memory / HDD are easily accessible. It looks as though the DVD drive would be easy to replace as well as others have mentioned. Comes with Windows 8.1, but has the free upgrade offer for Windows 10, as well as a free game from AMD. *Not listed in specs or shown in pictures - another neat feature is that the F keys have functions: -F1/2/3: Volume up/down/mute-F4: close window, F5: Refresh page, F6: touch pad on/off-F7: airplane mode, F8: app switcher (alt-tab)F9: screen off/on, F10: display settings (multi monitor, screen cast)F11/F12: brightness up/down -Additionally there are 2 LEDs on the front - for power (solid when on, flashes in sleep mode) and battery charging indication. Tested all the features of the laptop and everything works fine - USB 2.0, 3.0, DVD drive, WiFi, Bluetooth, HDMI/VGA, SD card reader, headphone jack, touch pad/keyboard, Ethernet. This laptop can support an external monitor via the HDMI and VGA outputs (tried 2 external monitors at once - only could use 1 at a time, either HDMI or VGA)."," These are mainly minor cons, especially if you will be replacing the HDD with a solid state drive (and upgrading the memory, preferably). Bloatware - this laptop is packed with bloatware, to the point that if used as shipped it will be quite sluggish, combined with the 5400 RPM hard drive. The memory is 4GB DDR3L 1600 and single channel - the APU supports up to 8GB DDR3L 1866. Additionally 1GB is reserved by the graphics unit so only 3GB is usable. Windows 8.1 - I didn't enjoy using Windows 8.1. It might have been better if this laptop had a touch screen. All of these cons can be resolved however if you are replacing the HDD and upgrading to Windows 10 - or at least clean installing Windows 8.1 / other OS."," I installed 8GB of DDR3L 1866 memory as other reviewers had suggested (The G.Skill 2x4GB kit) and a SSD (Crucial MX200 250GB). These upgrades make the laptop much speedier than how it comes stock. *-Windows 10 - for anyone wondering if you can do a clean install of the free Windows 10 upgrade -*What I did:Powered on laptop and installed all important/recommended windows updates, got the reserve Windows 10 icon and reserved the copy. (Could not download Windows 10 from the menu) - Downloaded the Windows 10 media creation tool from Microsoft and made a boot able USB flash drive, inserted into laptop and ran the upgrade tool, selected option not to keep any applications/settings (gets rid of the bloatware). After Windows 10 installed - verify that it is activated (with an internet connection - key shows up under system info screen) Perform hardware upgrades Do clean install of Windows 10 on new SSD, check that it is still activated ( key is activated, slightly changed from hardware changes)*- Linux -* To boot from other operating systems go into the BIOS (press in the small key next to power port) and change boot mode from UEFI to legacy support. I was able to install Linux Mint 17.2 in a dual boot configuration with Windows 10, everything works fine except for the WiFi: -All F key functions work-Goes into/out of sleep mode when opening/closing lid-Display - get the AMD driver from the drivers menu, or it will run in software modeThe WiFi does not currently work, so I would get a small USB adapter. You may be able to get it to work, but I gave up after a couple hours of troubleshooting it. -------------------------------------Overall, I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone on a budget - if they can reinstall operating systems and/or replace the hard drive, or at the very least remove the bloatware. 5/5 stars if upgrading to a SSD, 4/5 if using as shipped as it is still a great value (though I would remove the bloatware).",2,2
9SIA0AJ3Z89988,34-319-445,9/1/2015 1:04:41 PM,GL B.,Adequate for the $,4," My Dell Studio lost the mainboard at an inopportune time for my budget.  I purchased this G50 for the price to specs value and I'm not disappointed in any way with my purchase. Quit a few complaints about the keyboard but I must say I find it very good in everyway, comfortable and accurate.  The sound on this budget laptop is excellent compared to other low end laptops I have tried to listen to.  Sound quality is good, volume is excellent.  I've added another 4gb of the stock memory for 8 total, and possibly will upgrade to 1866mhz some time in the future.  I also have a ssdhd that will be going in soon as the stock hd is slow."," The touchpad is not as troublesome to me as it has been for others but it is a weak spot as the buttons are poorly designed and feel cheap and weak. The pad itself isn't to bad and has been accurate and smooth.  The screen ok but needs to be view from straight on, any angle and it quickly distorts.  The chassis is weak and I can visually witness flex along the front edge when lifting it. The HD is slowing things down and will soon be replaced. No superfish on this unit but plenty of bloat as was expected.", All in all i'm happy with this purchase and believe this laptop will last some time if properly cared for.  Windows 10 along with the cheap memory upgrade make It a winner at this price.,1,1
9SIA0AJ3Z89988,34-319-445,8/31/2015 6:46:28 PM,Seth P.,Amazing Value,5," Price-$280 for a 15 watt quad core apu notebook with a 15.6 inch 1366x768 screen.Now for my jumble of thoughts.  I was immediately impressed by the look, lightness, and thinness of the laptop, especially considering the price.  While all plastic (which although cheaper feeling does make it lighter) I appreciate the brushed metal look of the plastic and the matte border around the screen.  Boot times are pretty good considering the 5400rpm HDD, which I must say was not nearly as bad as most people make them out to be; I can only assume others are used to ssd speed.  I was able to upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 the first night I had the laptop and everything went smoothly.  The keyboard is shallow compared to most desktop keyboards (expected and normal) and while it isn't an amazing keyboard, it isn't half as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to be.  I have the same opinion of the touch-pad.  Not great, but very usable and not anywhere near as bad as some of the complaints I've seen in the reviews.  The screen looks good and has good color reproduction and a good refresh rate.  The screen brightness doesn't go either as high or as low as I would like but it is very usable and normal for a laptop.  Ports are as expected and they all work.  I can't comment on the DVD drive as I haven't used it and am planning to replace it with a second hard drive.  Speakers are good.Now, the APU.  I have never owned an AMD APU before, and so was both a bit worried and excited about the prospect, as well as not quite knowing what to expect.  I did already know all about them, I just hadn't used one and was already planning to upgrade to higher speed RAM.  I'm pleased to say that it performs remarkably well for a 15 watt processor.  Even with the stock RAM (more on that a little later) it performs surprisingly well in most older games and light newer games.  The laptop also stays pretty cool even when gaming, I never had the actual case or keyboard warm up even with the integrated graphics at 100%.Now for some actual numbers.  Today, I upgraded the RAM to 2x4GB of GSkill DDR3L 1866mhz CAS 10 RAM (available on Newegg for around $50, it's worth getting and I can confirm that it runs at full speed on this laptop, I don't think most other kits will actually run at 1886 because you can't manually  set the speeds).  Before the upgrade, I decided to do some amateur benchmarking as one reviewer claimed that he saw gains upwards of 20% on his average fps in some games.  So, here are my before and after FPS's on several of the lower requirement games I had in my steam library (go to ""Other thoughts"" to see the numbers, I ran out of space trying to put it all here).  Some of the averages actually went up by 50% or more, which was amazing and unexpected.  Also, for most of them, both the minimum and maximum fps got a good boost.  Basically, if you plan to do even light gaming on this notebook, the GSkill 1866 DDR3L kit is more than worth it."," I only have two real complaints with this laptop, with an additional one specifically for AMD.One, the battery life is kind of disappointing for a laptop with a 15 watt processor and a not-even full HD screen, although on the other hand I've never seen a Windows laptop with stunning battery life.Two, while a bit iffy because of the fact that not everybody games, I think it would be a good idea to include DDR3L 1866 RAM in the laptop instead of the DDR3L 1600 that they currently use.  I believe the sometimes 50%+ increase in game (and I assume other video uses) justifies this.Now, the complaint for AMD.  I was very disappointed that AMD chose to equip the A8-6410 APU with only a single channel DDR3L 1866 controller.  Giving it a dual channel controller alone would probably give it at least a 20% boost in video performance as it would allow the doubling of the bandwidth for the included graphics.  Also, this being an APU, they should have given it support for higher speed DDR3L, I realize that there is less and less market for higher speed DDR3L, but if just going from 1600mhz to 1866mhz gave some games a 50%+ boost in average fps, what would the jump from 1866 to 2133 (which I believe is the sweet spot price to performance wise for most APUs) be?"," The price I got it for ($280) basically makes all the cons null as I cannot expect most of those things for such a low price, they are just suggestions.Game FPS's (all recorded over a one minute time period with fraps, with my best efforts at using either completely the same gameplay or extremely similar gameplay):Game FPS- Before and After RAM UpgradeBeforeDS2 SOTFS:		Avg: 23.794 - Min: 20 - Max: 26Grid:			Avg: 30.167 - Min: 24 - Max: 41Grid 2:		Avg: 12.933 - Min: 7 - Max: 25Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning: 	Avg: 39.900 - Min: 28 - Max: 55Terraria:	Avg: 50.900 - Min: 27 - Max: 64Star Wars Battlefront 2: 	Avg: 34.867 - Min: 27 - Max: 46AfterDS2 SOTFS:		Avg: 33.550 - Min: 28 - Max: 43Grid:			Avg: 45.567 - Min: 32 - Max: 62Grid 2:		Avg: 29.883 - Min: 22 - Max: 38Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning: 	Avg: 46.550 - Min: 31 - Max: 61Terraria:	Avg: 52.167 - Min: 32 - Max: 59Star Wars Battlefront 2: 		Avg: 26.950 - Min: 17 - Max: 31The only score I was truly disappointed by was the one for Star Wars Battlefront 2.  I did figure out the problem though.  Since the minimum was actually 10 fps lower after the ram upgrade, it must be (and I do remember this from playing the game) because of the one  point when there were several explosions at once, which dropped the framerate way down and therefore created an outlier which also skewed the average fps.  The only thing I can think of to resolve the difference in the max fps is that there were different circumstances.  While I did play the same map and same team both times, I cannot control the rest of the circumstances.  Overall, this is a great laptop for both work and light gaming, and it goes from great to amazing when one considers the price of the laptop.",3,3

Full right hand Numbers pad."," The Laptop is so darn slow. It has 4gs of ram and although the HP G6 it replaced had 8gs (I added 4 non-name brand after market) The laptop was 4 years old and riddles with dinosaur glitches. This laptop can't stream a show. It has trouble keeping up with my typing while using google docs.  What laptop today can't keep up with a word processing program when it's offline? I was looking forward to finally gettting a Lenovo because I have been hearing good things about them This was a huge disappointment. The price is great but for a laptop I need to do  work (typing, streaming, music. The basics. No editing) it fails. I will most likely send it back rather than buy more ram. The design is pretty to look at but ANYTHING on your hands leaves smudges. It's like a black/brushed steel look.  The  laptop looks high quality but the key board does not.There's a lot of give with the whole keyboard. If you type a lot or with heavy hands like I do, it feels like you're going to break it or wear it down soon. The keys are also raised high and you can see beneath them.

Just replace that stock HDD with an SSD or with an SSHD (hybrid drive) and this PC for under $300 will be as responsive and fast as a MacBook. You can use Macrium Reflect Free and a $10 usb to SATA cable to clone the OS to the new SSD/SSHD. Also one could add another 4Gb stick of DDR3L ($20 or so) for an additional speed boost. But that is totally optional.!!! For those who are concerned about bloatware !!! There is a simple fix. Just upgrade to windows 10 and perform ""Reset This PC"" function which is built into the OS, that will wipe all unnecessary software leaving only bare Windows 10. Don't do Lenovo One Click Restore!Battery life is OK, lasting just under 4 hours or so. Screen is decent, with glossy finish, which may be a Con for some users.Overall - this is a great budget PC, more than suitable for office apps, school, web browsing, and even some light gaming.

Not long after it came in he called and asked if I would look at it for him complaining that it was far too slow. After two hours of wasted time I told him to call for a RMA. I am paying the return fees, if any. There is simply no reason under the sun that any computer should be this badly loaded with bloatware. Nor should you spend this kind of money and then have to try and remove it.

I would say you are going to spend an average of 2 to 3 hours minimum just removing all the pointless and downright frustrating software pre-installed on this machine. Also it only comes with 4GB of ram clocked at 1600 mhz which would be find for a standard CPU, but as this uses an AMD APU (GPU & CPU combo) the amount and speed of the ram dramatically effect the performance of this computer. However after a RAM upgrade along with the bloatware removal and installing Windows 10 I must say this computer is much faster than I ever anticipated and I am very pleased with it."," Upgrade to 8GB of DDR3L 1866 mhz! I cannot stress this enough, you seriously can see typically around a 15% to 20% performance increase, no joke! I personally bought the 2x4 GB G-Skill set of laptop memory from NewEgg for $52. Whatever set you buy be careful that you don't buy DDR3, but DDR3L ram (this runs at a lower voltage 1.35 v instead of the standard 1.5 v) and make sure your kit has the correct profiles. Some ram is rated for 1866 mhz, but doesn't automatically clock at that speed and you cannot overclock the ram as the BIOS settings for this computer are locked. After all is said and done you will have spend $332 on this machine or if you sell the ram that comes with the system like I did then $312. Despite the ""extra"" work this laptop requires I give it a 5 star rating as I don't think you can find any other modern laptop with this performance at this price period. Also keep in mind this computer was bought for an education teacher and while it can handle light gaming with the upgraded ram if gaming is a specific need for you then I think you'd be better off saving your money to get something more expensive in the future.",13,14

I like the rectangular power adapter port. It seems much sturdier than typical circular ports that tend to wear out, get loose and lose connection. RAM and HDD are easily accessible and simple to upgrade. trackpad and keyboard both seem fine."," You will need to run a firmware update ASAP in order to protect yourself from being the target of a ""man in the middle"" attack. Lenovo installs their Lenovo Service Engine (LSE) directly onto the laptop's firmware. This LSE checks to ensure that its adware is installed and if it is not then it will download it from Lenovo's servers. Since it is installed on the firmware, formating and installing a fresh copy of Windows will not remove it. Not only does this reinstall unwanted software if you uninstall it, but it also opens up an attack vector for hackers.I am unable to post a link for the update that supposedly fixes this problem, but you can google ""lenovo g50 LSE update"" and that should get you to the right place."," Remove all the bloatware and security flaws and this is a great laptop for the price.

Running Linux with wireless on this is a no go. Have tried many Distro's, Kernals, workarounds, alot of topics on this in Linux Community forums. Unless you want to run a USB wireless adapter until a mainstream Kernal supports this I would avoid it.

Handles light gaming like World of Warcraft just fine at moderate settings.  I do want to put in another stick of memory, but I'm not seeing any real performance issues currently."," First one I got started off well, then the wireless started to fail. Over ten days it went from 'that is weird, what happened to the wireless, better reboot' to pretty much unusable.  At least it was under warranty, and Newegg's RMA process is quick and easy.Other than that, the keyboard feels a little flexible, and I'm a little worried about how it will hold up over the long run, but so far not a problem.It develops hot spots pretty quickly in operation or when charging.  I think with the thinness it possibly does not have as much air circulation as my previous laptops, so you can feel where something is burning much power.  So not the best for having on your lap on a warm Summer day, but most laptops aren't the most comfortable for that, so not a major issue.  I do worry some about whether the hot spots could shorten component lifetime, but that is a something I shouldn't know for at least a couple of years."," Overall, I'm pretty happy with what I got for the relatively little that I spent on it.",3,3
9SIA0AJ3Z89988,34-319-445,8/1/2015 7:00:00 PM,GIFT R.,Best for the buck,5," Best deal in this price range. Next gen APU after jaguar (every console). Runs games at low-med mostly, but a few on decent settings as well as most older ones. Not one crash in a game yet. Runs COOL. Beyond expectation. Excellent cpu position on the motherboard for maximum cooling. Fullsize keyboard, dvd player, usb 3.0, nice textured chassis, right/left ""mouse"" buttons at the bottom of the touchpad. DOES have 802.11ac wireless LAN, DOES have gigabit Ethernet. Hdmi, vga output."," Bloatware, which can be resolved. Washed out off angle viewing. Camera's not the best."," I couldn't update my review, so I will put straight forward answers here since there are a lot of questions about performance. To Increase performance: Lenovo Bloatware can be deleted or disabled via control panel/programs or task manger/startup. The installed antivirus can be either removed or set to manual scanning in order to increase performance. There are multiple cloud apps, you should only need one. When updated with Windows 10, be sure to update all of your hardware drivers with W10 64bit versions via Lenovo's website. With these things alone, mine boots and is at the desktop in under 30 seconds easily, with over half of used HDD space. Night and day, though. The APU is single channel with one 64bit memory bus, so it doesn't matter whether you go with 2X4gb or 1X8gb of ram. I suggest 1866mhz speed as this will increase performance, and the APU is actually rated for only this speed from AMD. Comes installed with 1x4gb of 1600mhz, which is holding it back a little. AMD's APU's are probably affected the most by memory speed for noticeable performance increases for integrated processors. Spend the extra dollar for 1866mhz. Rated for DDR3L memory only, not 1.5v DDR3. Finally, an SSD is going to be the only other available performance based upgrade for this device, but should increase load times dramatically more so than actual performance (fps)while gaming or using rendering software. Remember, that it will take some time for your SSD to see cruising speed. Some only take a few reboots, others dozens. Make sure to get the proper new hardware drivers from the part manufacture's website whenever possible, and not through windows for best optimization.If you go the SSD route, and don't use your dvd player, you can always put your current 500gb HDD in it's place with an inexpensive adapter, or if you do use your dvd just use it with an external dock via usb!",7,7

This laptop was on sale, and I decided to buy it since I would be using it primarily for grad school.When I ran it out of the box, it was reasonably fast for the price. It's a much better value than any netbook in the same price range. However, I knew that I would be wanting more RAM and a faster SSD.After installing 16GB of G.SKILL DDR3L RAM and a 240GB Patriot Blaze SSD, this laptop is incredibly quick. Boot times are under a minute, multitasking is achieved with ease, and aside from the graphics scoring a 4.6 on the Windows Experience Index, everything else was above a 7. This is amazing for a budget laptop with a few upgraded parts.While the AMD Radeon R5 M230 isn't an incredible graphics card, it will still play League of Legends at a smooth 30-35 fps at 720p on high settings, and more demanding games will most likely still run on low settings.A suggestion: before switching to an SSD, I would recommend taking a USB flash drive and making a recovery drive for Windows 8.1 using the USB 3.0 port. It makes reinstalling Windows on the new drive much easier and faster.Lastly, I know it is not the fault of Newegg, but I had to RMA the first laptop I had because of a non-working headphone port and stuck pixel on the LCD screen. Newegg was quick to rectify the issue, though, and I got my new laptop about 1-2 weeks later. Lenovo might want to work on its quality control, even if these are budget laptops.",5,6

This laptop is good for home use and offers many of the features needed for both daily home use and business.  This laptop also has the newest 'ac' WiFi adapter and internet/home network response is very good. Setup also let's you schedule your free upgrade to Windows 10.I'm not a gamer so I can't speak with any knowledge as to it's abilities in this arena.The Newegg price for this unit was exceptional.  I stayed with the standard shipping (4 to 7 days) but the laptops were actually received on the third day!  That is GREAT response., The footprint of this laptop is quite large in comparison to today's high-end units but I don't haul this around so it's not a factor for me.   I traditionally use my Chromebook for everyday stuff and only need this when I have a task that requires me to use a Windows-specific application.  I admit that's not a very fair comparison., I'm a pretty 'strict' grader so don't let my 4 stars imply anything other than a good solid product at a good price.  I didn't give this one more egg only because of the footprint.,1,2
9SIA0AJ3Z89988,34-319-445,7/22/2015 2:30:05 AM,Samuel L.,Great Deal,5," Great performance for the money, decent battery life, 5 hours is honest time, but the battery is tiny, probably a 3 cell. Plus side for this is it charges up from dead in about an hour - very quick. Graphics are as usual for AMD mobile parts better than Intel's comparable part, although either battery life or processor capabilities will be less. It's always a trade off in these systems. This is the combo I wanted, I will take less battery life and slightly less  processor power to get much better graphics. It is a 4 core processor, so keep that in mind if comparing."," Not much, 4gb of memory isn't a lot, but Windows 8 seems to handle it well. I did delete the track pad driver that came with it, and let Windows run the track pad and that improved the track pad to the point it were I expected the track pad to be."," This was supposed to be a $500 system originally, I believe it.

The touchpad is very buggy. Keyboard keys feel cheap. Webcam quality is very poor.

In the past, their thinkpads have performed great which led to believe that their other laptops will at least be of the same quality. Right out of the box, I immediately noticed how slow it was running windows 8. Navigating through windows explorer (file system) is a struggle for the laptop. Downloading and installing some of the basic apps* on this laptop was similar to working with a 98 dell that was used by a 14 y/o kid, SLOW!!! I can't emphasize enough how slow this was running out of the box; it was truly astonishing. I ran a virus/adware scan on it using SAS premium, and it found over 70 files associated with adware and ad-ons known to cause problems. This is absolutely unacceptable. As of right now I am going to contact the seller and see if I can possibly exchange this laptop out. I want to believe that maybe I just got a bad one. I will update this review afterwards.

Very snappy, hard drive seemed pretty responsive and quick as well. I tested PlanetSide 2 which ran around 25-40 FPS on lowest settings and around 15-20 FPS on medium settings, which is surprisingly decent for such a low cost system. If it will run PlanetSide 2, it will probably do whatever you need it to do. AMD APU means great battery life, and it showed. I was barely able to drain the battery before the client was on their way to pick the machine up, and it charged quickly as well. Very thin, very light. Lighter than I expected. The display isn't amazing but at this price it sure seems gorgeous. =) If these go on sale again I'll probably get one for my own personal use, time to upgrade from the old e6400 to something more modern."," None honestly, best budget laptop I can find right now.", Enjoy!,2,2

She does not play many video games, just mostly YouTube and Photoshop, so I figured this laptop would be very nice if she ever planned on starting gaming. Her entire time using the laptop she never put much strain on the cards (I've been keeping track of temps, etc.) and everything seemed fine. I then decided to have her try out World of Warcraft with me (a notoriously easy to run game) and we played fine for an hour or 2 a day for about a week. Soon after, however, she suddenly started getting extremely bad screen tearing and random display issues. I troubleshooted everything and eventually narrowed it down to the card being faulty somehow. (For example, Stardew Valley plays fine on her integrated card but when switched to use the Nvidia it has screen tearing and display issues). We got the laptop on a 50% off sale so It isn't a huge loss but I would definitely NOT recommend purchasing this for full price unless you plan on not putting the Nvidia card under any form of stress whatsoever.",None,None

Great Wi-Fi coverage from the laptop itself we have 12other conflicting Wi-Fi singles from neighbors and it normally being as far away from the router as it was, most other devices in the house had no Wi-Fi signal in the same spot. Did ok with some gaming its by no means a gaming computer but so long as your already not expecting much or for it to last long without wall power still delivers a playable experience in older games."," After having it for a few months from time to time it wouldn't power own normally fixed by changing the slot the ram was in or taking out the battery and draining its power, recently it will power one once in a blue moon it may turn on once every 30days if lucky the ram still works as well as the battery doubled checked with parts with a friends exact same laptop. After a week after it not turning on at all I called Acer support at that point in time we hadn't had the laptop for more than 6-7months all I ever got from their support person was it wasn't under its manufactures warranty not because I had taken it apart because it updated to windows 10 so instead of fixing the problem I ended up just making it a paper weight, also this seems to be a very common problem.", I would say this is a great product if you need something for school on the cheap I got this laptop for under $550. At this point in time its nothing but a paperweight at the same time Acer's support team isn't the worst customer support I've ever dealt with but they are high on the list of companies I don't want to call unless forced. I will add I don't have a issue with their laptops or their construction but I still don't see how a OS upgrade or even change warrants a void warranty but if their support team members claim that's so then even when I called several times during the same week even speaking with a manager I guess its so.,None,None

The hybrid hard drive (with solid state cache) makes for short boot times and overall quickness of the system. The discrete GPU is very impressive for the price point (runs newer games well, maxes older games with high framerates)."," While the build looks nice, the plastic it is constructed of is cheap. Similar to the case, the display does feel cheap with somewhat small viewing angles and, at times, noticable backlight bleeding. This is NOT a laptop for a new user; with the discrete graphics and newer networking card, driver issues are unavoidable. Also getting games and other programs to utilize the discrete graphics proves to be troublesome at times. While it does work, without a more advanced knowledge of utilization of windows and nvidia programs, it can be more trouble than it is worth."," I would reccomend this laptop to an advanced user wanting to have the headroom to game.

Later on, it will be used  for school. This laptop is a good general-use machine. The 1TB of memory has allowed me to load it up with a couple games, and many media files. So far I have found that it can run most new-er games at a good setting, if not high. I've been able to run multiple streaming instances with no noticeable deficit in performance. It seems durable enough, but I have not really stress tested this much beyond being packed in a laptop bag and thrown around with some heavy equipment. The speakers work great.It starts up very quickly, and I have found no problems with it overheating even under continuous use. Battery life seems alright, but I have not used it extensively unplugged."," The track pad is not great, but is workable. More irritating than anything - but I use a USB mouse so this has been a non-issue for me.There is no optical drive. This, for me, is also a non-issue as I have an external.

Plays WoW at high settings at 1366x768 smoothly, but drops down to about 30 fps in crowded areas. Immediately pulled hard drive, installed SSD, and reinstalled vanilla 8.1. No need for the bad bloatware. The LCD panel is just abysmal, but since it uses a standard 30 pin LED connector, I was able to purchase a replacement matte IPS 1080p panel and swap them out with zero issue. remove the bezel, and 4 screws. In and out. Cost was $83 + shipping for the panel. I can't play all my games at the same settings at 1080p, but scaling from 720p up to 1080p isn't terrible on this panel. Defnitely better than native 1366x768. Plus IPS matte is just amazing.Also supports a backlit keyboard you can find at any parts store for around $22. It's from a different acer 573g model, but it fits like a glove in the palmrest.Also since it doesn't come with a CD drive, purchased a super slim dvd drive HDD caddy for $12 that allowed me to take the 1tb drive it came with and use it in conjuction with my 120gb SSD as a main boot drive. So for around an additional $120 (give or take the cost of an SSD, I had an extra 120gb laying around which worked fine.) You can get the same quality/features of a $1000-$1200+ laptop.Definitely like how modular this laptop is. The worst part about buying a laptop is all the stuff you don't really need. Yeah I want an i5 and GPU, but I don't need 16gb of ram or an i7, a high res panel, or a built in SSD. all these things are mark ups from the manufacturer that inflate the cost.Just give me my horsepower at bare minimum price, let me handle the additions."," Touchpad is unusable. But its meant for primarily gaming, so a mouse is always taken with it..Panel is just abysmal for viewing angles, but with how easy/inexpensive it is to replace, It was the first thing to go."," This is definitely the laptop for someone who is comfortable disassembling them and upgrading laptop parts. From a basic consumer point of view, yeah I can see why you wouldn't like it. If you want the better laptop, pay the convenience fee of having someone in a factory put the parts in your laptop for you, but expect a  mark up of around + 50%. Otherwise, pick up a screwdriver and watch a few instructional videos, you'll thank me later.",2,2

AC wireless. 8gb ram. Get an honest 6+ hours of web browsing with screen brightness turned down. Boots to desktop in mere seconds with latest drivers installed. Plays all of my games at medium+ settings, even new ones. Looks cute."," Standard Bloatware. Flimsy chassis I would expect to see on sub $300 laptops, but I have seen better on sub $300 laptops. Rattles since day one, rattles when I open it, close it, type on it, use the touchpad. Screen doesn't close all the way without a gap, speakers rattle at anything over half. Box was fine when delivered, so I assume this is from the factory. Went to add more ram, and saw that the Fan assembly is held down by one screw and a chassis pin, even though it is threaded for a screw where the chassis pin is at. This IS the cause of my main rattling. My touchpad was loose, and seemed to get locked into place after using it a few days. Screen is subpar and will literally washout text at all but direct viewing angles. You have to have the screen tilted ALL the way back for best viewing experience. Due to it's flimsy nature, this laptop stays mostly stationary at my home, and will likely never see travel outside of my house."," Update ALL of your drivers from Acer's website, for your specific OS, and you will see good changes! Ram comes in a 1x8GB configuration, so you aren't getting dual channel memory from the factory, so you'll have to add a second stick of ram for that. Despite my issues, this may or may not occur with yours, and I would still recommend this laptop as a good deal with a lot of nice hardware features in the price range.",1,1

Similar annoyances while gaming.  Updated latest firmware.  Turned off all of the windows 8 gesture non-sense and the pad still behaves poorly.

9SIA0AJ3KD0718,34-315-016,8/3/2015 8:23:25 AM,Sam E.,An acceptable trade of Pros and Cons,4," The hardware is a great deal if you catch this on sale. I've been putting the Nvidia card through bench marking paces, and I'm happy with the results for a mobile setup. I've always wanted an SSD, but it turns out this is an SSHD. Basically it stores the most used files on the  solid state memory automatically. It's still much faster. My old Acer Aspire E1-571-6387 had one advantage which was the CPU, otherwise everything is just as good or better. This was a good upgrade. It's about two pounds lighter as well, and feels like a sturdy build."," Lots of minor things,You'll want to buy a USB mouse for when you're not chilling on the couch watching Youtube, the touchpad is like trying to finger paint with a hotdog, except you can only hold it with salad tongs.The CPU is the bottleneck here, I stepped down from an i5 Quad-Core @ 2.6GHz. You'll notice tiny audio skips if you've got music playing and open a second tab in Chrome. That being said, it hasn't impacted my gaming yet, and the SSD picks up some slack.Oddly, for the GPU it packs, the screen is poor quality. The wireless adapter seems a bit weak, at least weaker than its predecessor."," Keep in mind I got this on sale for $460. The top lid has a strange fake wood texture.Moving from Windows 8 to 8.1 is a bit jarring.The power button is right next to END and above the - key, I just know I'm going to hit it accidentally some time.You can put a fan into the CD/DVD bay, and if you're upgrading and won't make use of your old laptop there's an open RAM slot, although 8 is usually enough for most people. The keyboard is nice, but set back pretty far and the touchpad is large and takes up a lot of space up front.For those with specific room set-ups and are interested, the power charging port is on the right. Battery life is average.I took a bar off my tech level two years ago since I don't dig around in the OS like I used to. I know 98, XP and Vista back to front, but I haven't messed with the newer ones. I also haven't built anything in a few years. The reason I bring this up is because it SEEMS like a firmware built-in thing, but whenever the lid is lifted up, it disengages the NUM lock. It seems like an Acer thing, but I would take this bit with a grain of salt.BOTTOM LINE, I'd recommend it to you on sale price, but for the normal price of $660, I'd save a bit more and find something with a more powerful CPU.",1,1
9SIA0AJ3KD0718,34-315-016,7/30/2015 3:29:15 PM,Gabriel P.,Definitely good if you get it on sale,5," Very good specs for the price I got it at ($470+tax). Nothing else I found at that price range came close. It beat my old computer in pretty much every spec. The fan is almost unnoticeable. Runs very cool. Battery life starts at about 8 hours of standard non-intensive usage from my experience. Not an especially big fan of the white but overall it feels sleek and it's very light weight. It feels very thin compared to my old laptop too, making it much more portable. In short, it's practical, high value for performance, and reasonably portable."," The screen quality isn't particularly good but considering the other specs of the computer that's a very minor consideration for me. Speakers are ok but not great. I use headphones but if sound quality is a must, you might just consider getting a set of good speakers with this. Webcam is a non-consideration. My phone has a better camera if that's something you even bother with, but I doubt most will. Windows 8 is kinda gross but I'll be updating it to windows 10 for free (which doesn't void the manufacturer warranty, I checked), and in the mean time I downloaded a start menu app to hold me over. I've been mostly a windows 7 user."," I've been using it for school work but some of the work I've been doing either requires the use of multiple screens or a decent amount of processing power and I was pleased to be able to connect an HD screen (1080p) without any major problems. Doing this I was able to notice a very slight but constant flicker but nothing I could see when I wasn't looking at it. I've watched a few HD movies that way with no noticeable problems. Overall it runs smoothly. I personally don't regret this purchase and it's practical for what I need (going to any price range cheaper than this at the time meant a big drop in performance, which may still be worth it for some light users, but not for me).",1,1

The top half of the screen flickers from time to time, even though the bottom half is unaffected.  Usually resolves itself within 2-3 minutes, but obviously indicating a problem with hardware.  Now I am receiving a ""display driver has stopped responding"" message, and the screen goes black.  One time I had to restart the computer to resolve the issue, another time it started working again within a minute or two.  I bought this product because it had almost no negative reviews and was highly recommended by others.  Normally these issues would not be a big deal, sometimes you get a lemon.  However, Acer technical support was a pain to work with.  I was being told it would take 6-10 business days of shipping, and 7-10 business days of repair to get my product back, with no other options available.  Only after 2 hours on the phone and escalating the issue through 3 levels of customer service did I finally reach an ""acceptable"" resolution. Although not the one I wanted, the service rep was able to expedite the process, cutting down shipping to 2 days and putting me #1 in the repair queue.  I don't think it's fair for a manufacturer to expect their customers to go 2-3 weeks without the product they purchased less than a week before, especially when so many other manufacturers will send a replacement and allow you to return the defective product in the same box the new unit arrived in.",None,None

To upgrade this machine the keyboard, HDD, and Fan must all be removed before you can access the open ram slot.  IMO this severely limits the life of the product unless you are comfortable with that level of disassembly. If this is a key decision point I would certainly perform a search on Acer E15 ram upgrade before hand.  I would have included links to those discussions but that is not allowed within a review.", If you would never upgrade the ram it's a fine computer.

A single 8gb stick lets you go to 16gb quick.light weight for school traversing.Its not that hard to install a new OS you have to do some work a little.boot loader is not locked, its just hard set till you remove the HDD that comes with it.  Had a SSD spare and replaced the HDD with it to put a Fresh install of windows on it (after getting the product Key that I paid for). Then got a 9mm HDD caddy for the drive that came with the laptop so i could have storage, the plate for the optical drive bay fit on the one I got  and mounted nice.SO get a HDD caddy, another stick of RAM and this will be a great school laptop."," Couldn't find the product key on any instructions or such, so I used a key finder and got it. I PAID FOR THE LAPTOP AND THE PRODUCT KEY, I'M NOT LICENCING IT FROM ACER.It should come with a install flash drive in-case of boot failure, I know they will send one if you complain to CS enough, but Not an issue for me. The GPU is build in to the board, I know that some gaming laptops have the GPU on a separate card for upgrades, but you can't ask for everything with a under $500 price tag. Isn't white really out of style, rather have the whole thing black or such like the top and bottom, seams like it cost more to use two colors. The glass on the screen is unnecessary, just use the matted design it gets less complaints.Why is it that much more to use a 1080 screen, does it really cost a whole lot more with inflation, those things should be laying around on some back order, feel like it cost more to make lower resolution screens with the way we have phones with better quality that can mach the power of the thing. And if you are not going to put a optical drive in then leave it as a area for another storage drive, few users even keep disk to use around, and if they don't then guys like me have to buy a caddy for a space that could house another drive + USB ports; or 2-3 M.2 SSDs in that area,Think ahead ACER that's how you innovate.

I was going back and forth on whether this would have enough power for me. So far I've been very impressed. It boots quickly, most likely thanks to the hybrid hdd. It easily manages multiple windows. On average I have 3+ google chrome tabs open, amazonmp3 or pandora, battle.net, and steam. I can be playing a game and tab in and out with little noticeable delay. Every game I've thrown at it so far I can play on high settings with 50+ fps. Games include: World of Warcraft, Heroes of the Storm, Starcraft II, League of Legends, Left 4 Dead 2, Orion Prelude, Resident Evil 5. The only game I play somewhat regularly that I haven't tried is Elders Scrolls Online but I'm currently downloading that as I type. If the performance is different than what I listed above, I will come and update this review.

The bootup time is quick and easy with the 8gb ssd it is very fast for a laptop of this quality. overall just a very well rounded laptop for the price., The only problem I seem to be running into is the wifi card it comes with. I have Verizon Fios and I have the 75/75 Mbps and I have done multiple speed tests and my download speeds are very low compared to my upload speeds almost a 4/40 Mbps its crazy and so I spent a few hours on the phone with a Verizon Fios technician and we did a whole lot of tests and resets so on so forth. I do have a MacBook and another Sony laptop with Windows 7 and they both have around 25/60 Mbps after doing speed tests but for whatever reason this laptop just doesn't get to those speeds and now I am thinking its the wifi card this could also be a defect perhaps because the download speeds on this thing are close to DSL and that is ridiculously slow., If anyone else has run into this problem and has figured something out please let me know!,2,6

When i installed shaders mod (very very resource consuming module that adds shadows, realistic water, and many other things) it only jumped down to 90 frames per second. That is REDICULOUS.

Hard to beat for what comes with this laptop.. the only fallback is 1366x768 glossy panel.. most people like native 1080p and turn their nose up to 1366 these days.. with the easily configured graphic cards I have an external 1080p that sits above the laptop so you have the best of both worlds.. But honestly, games run fantastic and look great on 1366x768 to ""me"". other things, no dvd bothers people..but I don't hardly use a dvd..and purchased an external for about 25 bucks to go with this.. which I probably will never use.. I wanted something around 450.00 that plays games..this fills the bill.. oh, added the xtra 8gig memory for 40-50 bucks.. Kingston DDR3L 1600 works fine.. you have to take out about 21 screws to install it though..might be another turn off for some.. no biggie to me.. beware 1 wire is attached to back case when you remove it.. so just tilt it off from the side with HDMI and all is well.. its a darn good laptop so far.. honeymoon period..I see they updated the picture..yes, it comes with white/cream on inside.. its not actually as WHITE as the picture shows..least on mine.. it actually looks pretty darn sharp to be honest..not an issue for me.. For Gamers: Most games will default to medium settings on install which is just fine for me and look and run good enough.. games average between 30(vsync locked) and 50 fps.. With the 940m I have GTA-V, sniper elite 3, World of Tanks, Skyrim, Alien Isolation, Farcry 4, Wolfenstein new order, war thunder, the hunter.. Im a gamer..this is for when away from home in RV and it works just fine with low wattage use 20 to 50 watts while gaming! Some games shoot up there in the 60-70 fps on medium and some work fine in vsync on high.... unless you want something that just runs High and Ultra High all the time..you can beat the price point here.. very good laptop with fantastic features in this price point.it is actually a SSHD drive..they kind of mislead here.. the 8gig ssd is built inside the drive itself.. it actually works pretty slick and fast.. the DVD bay is open and under assumption I would think another drive could be added internally..but with usb 3.0 and so many external devices..mine will probably end up being a fan spot..I have run a few AAA Games for hours already and it seems to work just fine..vents from the left side of laptop on mine.. it is warm air but I have not seen an issue.. no hot or even warm spots on the top cover/keyboard.. I have not left it on 24/7 though like desktops..Audio totally sucks..don't that happen on most laptops?? They mount the speakers on the bottom of the laptop which really was a dumb idea.. but easily fixed with headsets or like me, use a logitech sound bar and everything sounds fantastic..",6,6

I love the fact that this laptop uses Nvidia Optimus to turn off the GT 940m video card when not in use as this laptop will run 5-6 hours when not used.  And when you need it, it turns on seamlessly (it auto-detects which GPU it should use but it can be changed if desired.)  Its completely white with black keys on the inside and black on the outside which actually looks quote nice.  Also, its not a fingerprint magnet!  The laptop is completely textured which stops those nasty fingerprints from presenting themselves.  The back of the laptop can be serviced by removing 18 screws which doesn't seem very hard.  Webcam looks very clear in a well lit room (haven't tested it in a dark room yet)  Lastly, this laptop has a free optical drive bay that's not populated with a drive (So you can choose your own drive or utilize a converter to turn it into a secondary HDD/SSD bay)", None that really bothers me.," My laptop came configured with 1x8GB Hynix module (An additional slot is available for a maximum of 16GB of memory), a Seagate 1TB ST1000LM014 SSHD (The 8GB SSD is not available to the user but is used for auto caching data), a 1GbE Realtek Ethernet Controller and a Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377 Wireless AC 2.0 module with Bluetooth 4.1 for those who are wondering about the internal hardware.",7,7
9SIA0AJ3KD0718,34-315-016,7/1/2015 8:34:56 AM,Thomas H.,Great Budget Gaming Laptop,4," -Amazing price point for the specs--particularly the dedicated video card.-Has been running fine with no problems.-Shutdown/startup time is snappy.-Keyboard feels right for me--keys don't feel too soft or shallow, but not too loudly clicky either.-RAM is easily expandable from 8 to 16 GB.-Runs Linux well, with the one exception noted below."," -Only 3 USB ports.  4 would have been nice.-Buttonless ""clickpad"" style touchpad.-No optical disc drive, even though there's a covered slot where one apparently could have been installed.-Battery is not designed to be user removable/replaceable.-Newer WiFi adapter does not (yet?) appear to have a Linux driver.-Sub-1080p screen resolution (1366x768)."," There is one simple reason to choose this laptop over other options:  It is, at the time of this review, the best deal you can get on a new laptop with a GeForce 940m video card.  Even looking at used laptops with equivalent graphics cards, you would be hard pressed to find a better deal.Don't overestimate its gaming capabilities, however.  The 940m is explicitly a budget card; it may play just about any game presently out, but you'll have to use very modest settings for newer, graphics-intensive titles.  I listed the 1366x768 resolution as technically a con, but really you probably wouldn't want to try running newer games at 1080p with this laptop anyway.  If you're like me--I tend to play newer triple A games on consoles, and use the laptop more for older games, indie games, and RPGs, and I'm perfectly okay with not turning the graphics settings all the way up--then this laptop may be perfect for you.  If you want to play new games at their highest graphics settings on PC, then you're going to have to suck it up and settle for a desktop, or get ready to pay 2-4 times the price of this for a high end gaming laptop.I'll mention that I am dual-booting the preinstalled Windows 8.1 with Ubuntu Linux 15.04.  The only hardware issue I had is that the WiFi adapter doesn't appear to be supported in Linux yet.  This was easy enough to work around with a $10 USB WiFi adapter.  Also, I had to change the touchpad setting in the EFI BIOS from Advanced to Basic for it to work in Ubuntu.  It did work on Advanced when I booted Kubuntu, though, so I suspect there's a kernel module I could have loaded to support it in Ubuntu.  But I didn't notice any loss of functionality when I switched it to Basic, so I've left it like that.Beyond that, the difficulties of setting it up to dual boot were all related to Windows 8.1, EFI, and SecureBoot--nothing specific to this particular laptop.  You'll have to disable Fastboot in Windows, tell the EFI BIOS to trust Ubuntu's Grub installation (or possibly just disable SecureBoot), and put Ubuntu/grub ahead of the Windows Boot Manager in the boot order.Overall, I'm happy to have this laptop and to rate it at 4 out of 5.  The drawbacks are minor, and what you get for the price made it easily the best choice for me.",5,5

9SIA0AJ3KD0718,34-315-016,6/25/2015 3:08:59 PM,John B.,Bang for your Buck,4," * I bought this laptop for a client that had a lower budget for a college laptop. In the process I spent enough time with the laptop doing PC preparation to formulate a founded opinion of it. I have worked on countless laptops, and, as I write this, I am on an Acer S7. I bring this up because Acer is a company that rarely fails to impress me. I recommend their laptops to many people, for they are in my top three best manufacturers. The Aspire E 15 has great features for its price, well-rounded performance, and is all around a great bang-for-the-buck. *- I happen to really love the aesthetics of the E 15. It isn't an Ultrabook, but it's relatively thin in spire of the included DVD drive. It isn't the lightest of laptops, but a tad over 5 lbs, it still remains mobile. The top panel is covered in a black etched vinyl that feels exotic and looks appealing. It contrasts perfectly with the bright white interior and black keyboard. - Speaking of the keyboard, it has a great feel to it. The keys are sturdy, not mushy at all, and provide a nice haptic feedback. I don't have any huge issues with the keyboard's layout, but see Cons. The typing experience is exceptional.- The hardware in this laptop speaks to a much higher priced machine. It has a dedicated Geforce 940M GPU, which will give you a much better light-gaming experience than say the integrated Intel 5000 HD graphics. Don't get me wrong; it'd be foolish to expect gaming Triple A titles like Batman: Arkham Knight or Witcher 3 or GTA 5 and so on. But this dedicated GPU will carry you through light games like Minecraft, LoL, DOTA 2 and Heroes of the Storm. Likely a lot of Steam indie titles as well. I personally didn't have a chance, however, to test any games on this machine so I can't speak to the exact performance of the 940M, just what I know already about it. - I'm not positive on how much of a difference the 8 GB SSD  makes in the E 15, but I must say boot times were surprisingly fast and the OS didn't seem bogged down in the least. That's about as far as the SSD will carry you, but the 1TB traditional HDD will provide you with plenty of storage.- It sports a decent-looking screen, although the viewing angles and colors aren't the best. See Cons.- It has three USB ports. Two of which are USB 3.0s. It also sports a VGA and an HDMI port, allowing flexible video outputs. It also can pick up the 5GHz band and AC wireless for the fastest wireless speeds.The RAM is upgradable to 16GB, for there's only one stick of 8GB inside."," - The Aspire E 15 doesn't have a touchscreen for Windows 8.1, but you know this going in. In my own opinion, unless you own a convertible or 2-in-1, touchscreen traditional laptops are rather pointless. I rarely ever use min, but it may be relevant to you.- The screen is only 768p. In this budget range it is hard to get a 1080p screen, however. I'm nearly positive it isn't IPS, for the colors aren't eye-popping and the viewing angles suffer, but this isn't to say the screen is horrendous or anything. It's what you'd expect for this price range.- The touchpad isn't the best. I don't know exactly what's wrong with it; it at least has dedicated left and right click buttons, but it seems not to pick up the finger initially. It lags slightly on recognition. This little irritant couldn't be fixed by toying with the Touchpad settings. It also is a little jerky and lacks precision.- I wouldn't call it a cardinal sin in this day and age of laptop design, but the up and down arrow keys are mashed together as one, so they are slim and small as compared to the full arrow key layout. The enter key has the L design to it, which I never really liked, but most of this falls upon personal preference. - With this laptop, Acer bundled a lot of Bloatware with it. None of the bloatware is particularly bothersome; although, a few of the unnecessary apps start at boot, slowing boot time. I recommend uninstalling a good number of the included programs; AOL in particular. However, the Pokki Start Menu app is pretty cool. It isn't the best aftermarket Windows Start Menu app but it does allow you to forgo installing something like Start8 to get the Windows Start Menu back."," * Overall, you can't beat the price for this laptop. It has all the features you need for a mid-range, all-round normal consumer PC, and then-some in a few scenarios. It performs better than expected, although suffers in a few nuances. I'd recommend this PC over many others in it's budget range, and it's specs out weigh many PCs that are a lot more expensive than it, even by a hundred dollars in some cases. Overall, the Aspire E 15 was a pleasant surprise. *",9,10

By great effort I mean taking the entire thing apart, pulling the hard drive out, and loading it with linux after erasing windows 8 off the hard drive. The computer also doesn't have a sticker with the product key on the bottom, so without great technical knowledge its pretty hard for a normal person to get their product key without installation."," Not everyone wants to install windows and this is making me less likely to use Newegg.com in the future.

I personally when purchasing a laptop look for something that can handle light-medium gaming, games like Civilization and Hearthstone are perfect examples of what I want my laptop able to play and this performs those games just fine at High settings. There is also no Disc Drive for this Laptop, not something I am exactly considering a con due to how infrequently I actually require a disc on my PC but if you burn a lot you may want to consider a different laptop or an external drive.As a word of Warning to those dive into removing all the crud when purchasing a new laptop, you do in fact need the Intel HD drivers even though you have an Nvdia Graphics card. It is designed to use the onboard graphics card when not playing games and the Nvida card when playing games.

I prefer Linux so installed it as the sole OS; I'm running Mint 17.1 Cinnamon. Unlike a previous HP, this one works as it should on Linux, with the one small exception that sometimes the battery meter shows slightly less than 100%.With 16GB of RAM and a modern processor, running virtual machines (both Windows and Linux) is effortless. I use them to test code or to run custom environments.I run some Steam games, too, both with the Linux client and using Wine. Game and graphics performance are good, although the laptop will run a little hot, but that's to be expected."," None, really. A lot of the other commentators seem to have Windows issues that I don't experience, since the host OS is Linux.

9SIA0AJ35D7357,34-232-122,6/28/2015 6:23:59 PM,James R.,Great gaming laptop!,5," Bought this laptop about seven months ago brand new. The day I bought it I also purchased a Samsung 512GB 850 Pro SSD. Plenty fast, plays GTA5 and others great. Haven't played a game I couldn't run at 1080p w/ eye candy on between Medium-High, (even GTA5). Runs relatively cool considering what's in it. With battery saver mode on in Windows I get 4.5+/- of battery life, which isn't half bad considering. Can do over four hours of video playback unplugged, and that's not something you'd buy an i7/860GTX based laptop for. It's built well and I love the fact that they make it easy to upgrade and access the internals. Minimum flex in the body and it's a real light for what it is."," I've had a few blue screens recently. With how long I've had it now it could easily be a third party program or even the Nvidia driver, (the only one you'd really update often). Keyboard does tend to get warm after gaming for an hour or two, but that's without using a laptop cooler. The screen is definitely lacking in the viewing angle/rich color department. I appreciate the price point, (this is even cheaper than when I bought it) and I know they had to make sacrifices for it but the screen is almost inexcusable. Keep in mind I bought this last January and it's about $300 cheaper than what I bought it."," For what these are going for now it's a GREAT choice. If this is in your price range, (as of mid summer) I couldn't recommend a laptop more. Granted they have the 9 series out from Nvidia now, I don't believe the current equivalent of the 860M would be worth spending more money on. Also, looking ahead at the games coming out this year, there isn't anything that I'd be worried about not being able to play.",None,None

A lot of solid specs for the money.Try windows 8 for more than 5 minutes, its really not that bad.  In fact I like it.  Sure some things are tough to find at first, news flash, every single operating system is that way until you learn where stuff is.  Give it a week or two and a little patience and you may like Windows 8 as much as I do.", The main stuff works ok but there are so many little annoyances that keep popping up.  WIFI range is terrible.  Touchpad driver refuses to work for more than a couple of months before it stops working entirely.," For the record, I don't game with this computer, I just want something with decent speed (run Solidworks from time to time), dedicated card for better resolution, etc.  Don't want a cheapo laptop but didn't want to spend much more than a grand either.So most things work well.  Its the little things that drive me nuts.  The WIFI, which you would think everyone would have worked out by now, didn't have nearly the range I thought it would.  In places where my cheap Lenovo had great strength, my new ASUS right next to it would have zero connectivity.  I would walk a step at a time and do speed tests on both laptops.  The ASUS range was terrible.  Needed to move my router etc and reroute lines through the basement so it would work in my bedroom.The touchpad is awful as others have said.  Not just the ricketyness of the thing (I've gotten used to that), but the driver dies continuously.  Not with any rhyme or reason, just every few months it will completely die while I'm perusing some web page.  Touchpad won't do anything then.  Go to device manager, try to update driver, its always up to date.  The only thing I've found that works is uninstalling the driver and then having windows search for hardware and completely reinstall the touchpad.  Its these little things that I would think every laptop manufacturer in the world has worked out by now and should just work and not give you any problems ever that get really annoying.There have been a few other small things as well.  If ASUS could make the simplest components work properly on a consistent basis, keeping me off the ASUS forums for the simplest malfunctions, I'd probably be pretty happy with this laptop.  Judge this laptop for what it is.  They didn't advertise high end screens or SSD drives.  Its a pretty nice price for the specs, it just needs to do the easy stuff a little better.",None,None

It's really a minor issue (depending on the key) in the grand scheme of the whole laptop, but I don't know why ASUS keeps having this problem. When you pay so much money for a nice laptop, you really shouldn't be dealing with keys being chipped and not working properly.3) I had some issues trying to do a net install of a linux distro with this machine. The laptop has an Airplane Mode toggle rather than a Wifi toggle. I think that the WiFi should start automatically (and it does once an OS is installed), but it didn't start when I booted from a net install live cd and I couldn't toggle the WiFi. 4) I think they could have combined the backlit adjustment keys (F3,F4) into one button that just went Low -> Medium -> High -> Off and then back to Low. So it would work like a ceiling fan. Then they could have used another button for something more useful.", So far I'm happy with this machine.

Yes, it leaves fingerprints, but in case you haven't been paying attention, that's a problem with most laptops these days. There are $3,000 gaming laptops that still leave fingerprints, and I know it sucks, but get a cloth and clean it, people. That doesn't constitute a 2 star review...Also I had some issues with the internet driver, but honestly it took me 10 minutes to fix. I'd be willing to tell you how to fix it, if googling things is too hard for you. The rest of the drivers seem to work just fine. The programs MSI gives you (like it's audio enhancement nonsense) are kind of useless, and I pretty much uninstalled them out of the box.Most of the slowness and other minor problems I've had are ENTIRELY Windows 10's fault. I can't knock MSI or anyone other than Microsoft for the problems Windows 10 has given me. High Disk usage is a problem that windows 10 seems to be doing in every computer since certain updates, and I'm still trying to figure out how to get it fixed.

However if you know how to install drivers and uninstall programs and overall know how to use a computer, get this laptop. Plays games and other apps just fine. Great, in fact. Remember, this is marketed as a budget gaming laptop, and it does not disappoint in that respect.I think it annoyed me most reading the other reviews for this and how petty most of the complaints are. Yea, okay, that happens to almost all products with dumb reviews, but for something this cheap for what it has in it getting ripped on ""cause it's a bit flimsy""? really? I couldn't even find an Asus laptop to compromise this laptop with, and I guarantee it has the EXACT same problems.Anyways, you get what you pay for.

It comes with windows 10 which as you all know means a lot of junk comes with it including norton. I was able to remove norton with no issues so far i have not been  getting requests to try the free version.  I also removed some more programs that i  wont be using. Make sure you also update your windows 10 since there are updates out there.  The plastic does feel cheap but so far i have not seen a  problem with any loose parts. Screen is a little weak in terms of when you try and bend it you can tell its a little cheap, but how many of us are gonna bend our screens now?  I like this machine so far just remember if  you buy  it  to not expect as a start and go right away spend some time updating the drivers and system and then do  what you want to do, that willImprove your  experiene", -cheap plastic material( feels like it)-norton antivirus-windows 10 preinstalled apps,,3,3

N82E16834154111,34-154-111,12/5/2016 9:10:36 PM,James D.,My first review,4," -Good solid parts (i7, GTX960M,Dual fans)-Nice screen-Sleek Design-Lights to indicate num and caps lock-Very cool (temperature)-Quick boot-up time", -Needs to be updated -Keyboard is a bit crowded-Windows 10-Warranty voided if you change anything internal," This laptop has just arrived today and i have been using it for a few hours and so far I love it. I had switched from an ASUS to this MSI because I needed a faster processor for school and this was only $800 with a decent graphics card. Before I got my laptop, like you, I read every review and saw what most of the problems were and they had simple solutions. Most problems were small inconveniences like a loud mouse click, which isn't that loud compared to my old ASUS, and no black-lighting. There was also a complaint about heavy bloatware but when i got mine there wasn't much on here but Microsoft Edge. Also, the fan has a turbo mode, which is great if you are gaming hard, but unless you absolutely need it this laptop is pretty silent. Most major problems that most reviewers say is: the track pad is abysmal, there is static from the speaker, and the WiFi won't connect. The track pad is not horrible if you go into the settings and enable the two finger scroll, but you shouldn't have to know to do that. The static can be fixed if you change the minimum CPU power settings to 100% in the control panel, or re download the driver, and if that doesn't fix it, it might just be the sound of the fan but it sound like it is going through the speakers because this laptop has multiple air vents to let it breathe. I personally haven't had a problem with the WiFi, and if you are using this laptop for gaming you should be hard wired anyway, and if you do have problems, look for an update for the drivers. The worst thing about this computer is Windows 10 and that is because of the automatic updates that are random and completely destroys any WiFi in your house. One simple solution is, if you are on WiFi and not hardwired, you can set your connection as metered and this will stop Windows 10 from auto-downloading without your permission. Most of your driver problems like the static and WiFi can be traced back to drivers in need of updating or re-downloading due to weird Windows 10 coding.  If you don't care about the extra perks like back lighting and the best graphics since you looked out of a window then this laptop is great for the raw computing power and the ability to play some great games in between classes, and if you are in college with a degree that needs a good computer (engineering) I would suggest you look at benchmarks on the processor. I have really enjoyed the feel and look of this laptop and am looking forward to a long life, hopefully.",4,7

I do recommend a reinstall upon arrival & a couple other things I'll mention in Cons.Great Laptop! I have been building affordable gaming rigs for almost a decade--so I was leery of buying a laptop. I needed it for school and wanted it to do some basic gaming, so this came along at $799 and was a no brainer. I am honestly surprised at how well it runs the 1920x1080 resolution. Plugged into my ASUS VG428QE (24 inch 1ms) the native resolution runs great. And while I have to step down Video Settings from my previous AMD r9 390--there are definite gains in the ""slower"" but 3 generations advanced quad core processor. BF4  no longer has stilted moments--and to be honest, I hardly miss the 4x and HBAO options, Granted the max ghz is HDMI capped at 60, but I really don't care. A fortunately timed buy as  my r9 390 sucked my PSU's will to live--along with doing some mobo damage. Again, For the size, weight, price--as long as you can live with Medium settings--its smooth even in firefights."," MSI standard Bloatware: I first wrote a 3 star review, bemoaning the inability to switch easily to the dedicated driver. Once I reinstalled Windows, it works seamlessly now (fingers crossed). In addiction to Bloatware, I have coined a new hazard: ""Gooware"". The giant sticker placed next to the trackpad listing everything you know you bought--its adhesive had melted in the heat of the Delivery--leaking into two arrow keys. Luckily its pretty easy to get underneath and clean (I was lucky to catch it before it had gone into the toggle.) I would advise the manufacturer to PLEASE place the sticker somewhere else. With that much low=grade adhesive right next to the keyboard--its an RMA waiting to happen."," I am completely happy with this purchase. I thought I would have to get an SSD because of slow booting, but again, after the reinstall--it really isnt that bad. Im sure an SSD would speed things up quite a bit as the HDD is 5400RPM--but Im fine with it.

That's only if you damage the laptop or any hardware in the laptop when upgrading, so just be careful when you're upgrading.- For me, this laptop is perfect because I'm just a casual gamer and use it mostly for school work. I only play older games (e.g Batman Arkham series), so I won't be able to tell personal experience with newer games.

I'm a 3d animatior and game designer, so I'm always using heavy duty programs such as Autodesk Maya and zBrush.  I also use Premiere Pro and after effects alot and have never had any issues running these programs.  I also use Unity and Unreal Engine 4 all the time and the only time I've had these stutter are when I run the professional quality scenes provided from Epic Games in UE4.  I also game all the time on this laptop.  I've played countless hours of GTA5, Black Ops 3, Just Cause 3, and Crysis 2 and have never had any problems.  If you aren't playing demanding games the laptop actually stays really quiet, to the point where I can play certain games and people near me won't notice a difference in fan sound.

The SSD is blazing fast, full quad core processor, and the GTX 960m is basically a full-spec desktop GTX 750ti.  With the continued production, power consumption of the GPU has dropped well within mobile requirements.This laptop is also incredibly quiet even while gaming.  The temperatures are very reasonable for the hardware inside and this not being a high-spec gaming laptop with separate fans for the CPU and GPU.Red backlit keyboard is a nice touch and is very useful when travelling or using the machine at night.Though it's only got 8gb of RAM, it's a single stick so upgrading to 16 only requires purchasing  1 stick."," As others have said, the screen isn't great.  The color changes some have noted is actually because of some ASUS software where you can change the screen coloration based on what you're doing (gaming, movies, etc) and I found it tries to adjust automatically.  I wound up removing the program and haven't had another issue.  Some manual screen coloration adjustments have improved the contrast, but it's still a fairly washed-out screen at most angles unless you've got a perfect viewing angle."," I'm very satisfied with this machine for the $650 I paid.  It was a good price then and 6 month s later I think it's still fair market value even as newer hardware has become available.  I've actually recently started doing a lot of my gaming on this laptop leaving my desktops to run Folding@Home more of the time.  It's no match for even my older desktop with twin 780 Tis, but for most gaming, especially plugged into my home theater setup on a 1080p projector, it's more than adequate.I would highly recommend removing a lot of the ASUS utilities as they just caused problems for me.  As I said above, removing the screen adjustment software fixed the issue of the screen changing colors (from a warm temp hue to high temp and back).I've not encountered any issues aside from that software glitch.  One other thing worth noting is that the built in speakers are awful.  I've seen many cheaper laptops with better speakers.  I think ASUS is thinking like me regarding this that most users that plan on playing games are going to be using some sort of headphones anyway so it was an easy place to cut cost.  Still, a slight upgrade here would be greatly appreciated.",2,2

It's very hard to tell if it's on. I just end up typing and then find out.-Sometimes the wifi can't detect any networks. I have to turn the computer off and then back on-The scroll on the touchpad stopped working after an update. I had to manually update the drivers-When I connect to a TV using HDMI, the sound won't play through the TV. Still haven't figured that one out.-My issue similar to Ryan L. Similarly, after about a month exactly, I noticed that when I would have it unplugged and wouldn't use it for five minutes, it would sleep or turn off the monitor as it was supposed to, based on the settings. However, it wouldn't come back on when I'd touch the touchpad or keys. I'd have to turn it off and then turn it back on.I called service. I had to explain the issue to the technician multiple times as she would repeat it back to me incorrectly. She suggested I download a driver and then call back if there were still issues. I installed it, no difference. I called back. This time a new technician told me to hold down the power button for a minute. My computer would no longer turn on. She explained the process of sending it in for service and when I inquired if they would pay for my data backup (since it was her direction that caused it to not turn on anymore, she told me they wouldn't. When I said I wanted to be transferred to a manager, she transferred me but the call was disconnected. I called back, got transferred to a manager, and repeatedly heard their policy that they can't cover data work. That person's manager called me the next day, at my request, and repeated the policy multiple times again. I understand that they can't technically pay for my data back-up. But when you talk to other companies, they'll find some other way they can compensate you or help you out. Also, I periodically back-up my data, but I had no idea to expect that I should back it up before performing the steps that their service technician instructed.

It seems the drivers have not been updated in a while, and with Windows 10 constantly being updated this is becoming ever more important. Here are several problems off the bat that I encountered:-Network card had intermittent connection. It would randomly disconnect without explanation.-Keyboard backlight did not work properly.-Upon putting the laptop to sleep and waking, it would not wake. A hard reset was required.-The sound is frankly terrible. Usable, but pretty bad as far as laptops go. Think of a 1980s video uploaded on youtube today with its muffled and outdated sound. Thats what it sounds like.-Most of the hotkey functions were not working (couldn't turn off touchpad, adjust keyboard backlights, etc). Only the very basic functions worked (adjust volume, screen brightness).-Bluetooth driver was broken and refused to power on.-While attempting to update the graphics card, the laptop crashed and caused the install to be corrupted. I had to reinstall the system.-The screen was blurry.Now, that being said, even with all of these problems, I still believe this laptop to be worth its run. For nearly every single problem listed above, you essentially NEED to go on the ASUS website and manually update every driver. As soon as you boot up this laptop, make sure you go into advanced system properties and disable the windows update ability to automatically update drivers. Its going to get it wrong and break things even more.However, that is STILL not the end of it. Some drivers on ASUS website, even the updated ones, are STILL broken, since many have not been updated since 2015 (go figure right).In my case these were the network card driver (wifi), bluetooth driver, and some other intel component that I can't remember. Basically all of them were intel components. You should go on the intel website instead and look up their respective drivers, and download them from there instead, as they will tend to be more up to date than the ones on ASUS website. Installing those fixed the intermittent wifi connections and bluetooth problems.The sleep problem was fixed by updating the bios from ASUS website.With the bloatware and driver problems I honestly found it easier to simply install a clean copy of windows and start from there. However, I strongly recommend you make an image of the laptop in its factory state in case something goes wrong, which it probably will.The screen blurry issue was simply because for some reason Windows kept setting the recommended size at 120%, which is not the true size. As a result, everything was blurry. Just set it back to 100% and problem solved.After dealing with all of that nonsense, the laptop turns out to be extremely dependable. Apart from the sound. I don't think that can be fixed, sorry. You are better off wearing some headphones. Just make sure that after all is said and done that you set up Windows to use the HDD drive instead, and you point your default folders over to the HDD, since this is not done for you."," In conclusion, I'd still recommend this laptop. It runs extremely well with its SSD-HDD combination, it handles most games very well, and its very fast. It did come with quite a number of problems (but nearly every laptop has that one little annoying thing you have to fix), and it took me a while to work them out, but after all is said and done I am quite pleased with the machine. It looks pretty mean and performs very well, all while staying within budget.",6,6

This all happened when I started back school as a full time student and needed a laptop with at the very least internet. Newegg was quick to allow me to return the laptops, where I was able to receive a refund and bought something else.

And the usual add-ons that come with it.," I read the reviews, and took both the good and bad to heart about this product. I JUST recently bought this cause I was in need of a new laptop, and saw the price. 750? And a free bag?!  And on Newegg?! What more could one gamer want?! Thats amazing compared to finding it for its regular price of 1000+ on online sites, or Best Buy. Arrived in two days, fresh in its box, and the bag came about two days later. Booted fine, nothing unusual. Went through the programs and removed some of the bloatware, keyword some, and checked out  some of the settings. Downloaded some useful programs, namely Chrome and such and had no problems whatsoever. A few days later, Chrome acts up on it. I uninstall it, and see that some of the leftovers are on the solid state. Cant remove, but I do see the setting of restoring the computer back to when I just opened it. I follow through and let it go through the night. The next day I turn it on, shows the manufacturer's logo for a few seconds, screen goes black, cuts off, and repeats over and over with an audible click happening every time.

Why a ""gaming laptop"" for business use? Most business laptops have lesser specs and cost more so there you go. On with the review... The hardware in this laptop is pretty decent for the price. Skylake cpu, 8GB of ram, M.2 SSD AND a 1TB mechanical drive, dedicated 960m graphics card... Not too shabby. The biggest letdown and my biggest gripe is this terrible lcd panel that Asus put in this thing. The viewing angles are horrible on the vertical axis and its difficult to read small text. Color reproduction isnt all that great either. Its possible that I received a ""not-so-good"" unit but I doubt it. If you adjust the angle of the panel to remove glare from other light sources, it reduces the readability of small text. My main desktop has 2 TN panels and i dont have this issue this bad. As far as performance goes, its ok. I never had the intentions of gaming on here regularly but having that dedicated gpu does let me play games while away from my main PC. The battery isn't the greatest either. After about an hr of light use (invoicing software and wireless radios off), with the monitor off (has a hot key to turn the panel off which is nice IMO), the battery is nearly 3/4 dead. I have a pure sine wave power inverter installed in my truck so its no problem for me to keep it plugged in. The speakers are horrible as well. Most people who buy laptops for gaming usually use headphones of some sort anyway so this is not really a con. They sound very tinny and distorted, even at low volume. I personally dont care since its not the main purpose of this machine. I have and use many of Asus's products but this one is letting me down with this terrible panel. It's to the point that I cannot return the laptop and the panel is driving me crazy. I'm looking for options to see what other panels will fit in its place or replacing the laptop entirely with a different brand. Since the panel is something that must be used, unlike a mouse or speakers, which can be easily swapped out, I'm giving this only 2 stars.",1,1

Most importantly, I can switch ttys and use modesetting because these are all handled by the integrated graphics rather than the nvidia binary blob.Encrypted both hard drives with LUKS on LVM and a swap file for encrypted suspend to disk with no trouble.There are some guides that recommend the idle=nomwait kernel boot parameter to disable c-states for this intel chip; don't use this. Recent kernels support c-states just fine and your machine will run much hotter if you disable c-states.Keyboard feels nice, overall the system is very responsive.With kernel boot flags acpi_osi=! and acpi_backlight=native, all of the media keys work as expected."," Turning off the gpu using bbswitch with bumblebee is trickier than it should be. Bumblebee turns off the GPU on first boot, and, for some reason, x11 hangs and I need a hard reboot if I startx with the nvidia module unloaded. This can be fixed by loading the nvidia module with modprobe nvidia right before startx, and then, after x11 starts, running 'sudo rmmod nvidia && sudo tee /proc/acpi/bbswitch <<<OFF' to turn off the GPU. Bumblebee then correctly manages the GPU. Note that this can be automated with scripts and systemd services, so it's not too painful, and nearly halves power consumption with the GPU off (according to both powertop and actual battery life -- now I get over 4 hours of battery life).As others have mentioned, the display is a little washed out and has poor viewing angles."," I would recommend this to people who want to use a GPU on linux, either for gaming or for prototyping scientific computing applications.",5,6

But... a good laptop is so hard to find and I want to put a good word in for this one. I was looking a gaming laptop with a decent dedicated Nvidia card, (No AMD) an SSD, and a 1080 anti-glare screen. I first went with a Dell in this same price range with similar specs and was faced with endless hardware failure issues that left me going through three failed laptops in as many weeks.Anyway, none of that has happened with this ASUS. It runs beautifully, it's incredibly fast and the SSD is the boot drive, and I've actually loaded my key programs onto that SSD as well. I was initially looking to move away from HHD's, but since the system boots off the former, I'm glad to have the extra space it offers. I've already set my Steam library to install to it instead of the C: drive.The computer is whisper quiet, and even when gaming, I didn't get much heat or fan noise. My first test was to run the new Mad Max game - it came in on high settings splendidly. The 960M is a fine card, especially for this price. Will you run games coming out in the next year on ultra high settings? No, maybe not. But most certainly high-mid or high settings. If you want more than that, get a tower you can upgrade every year, anyway.I like the keyboard design to a num pad and arrow keys into the set-up. The touchpad and keys feel nice, too. Not too flimsy, not too stiff.Finally, the packaging is beautiful. For an $800 computer, you feel like you're opening something thrice the price."," The speakers are awful. They're pretty low volume and the quality isn't anything to write home about. If you're a gamer or have a serious computer mind, though, anything of great importance will be run on some decent headphones."," This is a killer laptop worth every penny. I'll revise this review if anything goes awry, but it's everything I was looking for and so much more. NOTE: There are some decal-type lines on the keyboard I didn't notice when I ordered. Even now, the photos make it a bit hard to see. Fortunately, it's very understated and actually quite nice - I'm not a fan of over-the-top gaming designs. Just worth mentioning in case you don't like that.",1,1

Not IPS but still looks very decent when using the Asus Splendid app in combination with the Intel graphics/video settings. Looks better than my $300 1080p monitor. Decent battery life. Just doing normal browsing and light work can get an easy 4 hours, maybe more. Did quite a bit of research before settling on this laptop. Quad core Skylake i5 does a surprisingly good job. I'm coming from a custom build gaming pc and normally go all out with the highest gear(i7, 980ti, SSD everything, etc), and this laptop keeps up more than I thought it would by quite a lot. 960M is a great medium graphics card. No, it won't push 60fps on max settings for all of the latest games but will still be able to play them on Medium just fine. Considering this system is roughly the same cost of a high end graphics card alone, you get quitea bit of performance.Been on Newegg for almost 9 years and purchased several of my system components here. Never been compelled to write a review on a product until now. - Not a con of the system itself but this does come with Windows 10 and quite a bit of bloatware like any new system. You will spend a little bit of time removing what you don't want and optimizing the system. That being said the driver support has been good and everything runs smoothly; no crashes, lock-ups or anything. I would highly recommend this system to anyone looking for a decently priced performer. It has a decent battery life for work on the go, enough power to keep up with you for play, and looks great. Yes, there might be other similarly priced systems on the market but mostly boil down to your preference. I have used Asus for many years and never been let down.

Bloatware, of course, but after less than 20 minutes it was all sorted out. Certain programs take forever to load, my main nitpick is GeForce Experience. I've seen it take up to 30+ seconds to load, even minutes after boot and system is idle. Not sure if finicky SSD, the prog takes an absurd amount of cpu time, or just the prog itself.Also, a Blu Ray player would not go amiss, but maybe I'll upgrade later on."," While this is indeed labeled as a gaming/enthusiast grade laptop, I snagged it for fairly menial usage.

For example, this laptop can run Warframe maxed out @ 1920x1080 and get 90+ fps, but once you unplug the laptop from the charger, the framerate will drop significantly, in this situation it dropped to <30 fps, losing 3x the performance. This has certainly something to do with a battery saver function, so in theory you could turn it off, but you would suffer from extreme battery drain.I would definitely give this laptop a 5 egg rating if it actually included a IPS display and dedicated left and right trackpad clicks, but unfortunately it falls short.

It's not as bad as people say it is."," I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone who wants a cheap, solid, and well built laptop.  I would buy this laptop again if I had to.

Absolute garbage.-Touch pad lost connection on one of two I picked up, had to open it up and reset the cable. All good after that. Full disclosure, might have been my fault during upgrade process but don't know for sure.-Default install is bloated. Had to do a fresh win10 wipe and install.-Battery life is minimal if you're running max load gaming while unplugged, but that's not so much a con as an expectation imo."," I picked up 2 of these, one for my wife and one for me.  My wife uses it for web design, image editing, and gaming. I use it for gaming and HD video streaming. We're both very satisfied on the overall bang for your buck on this laptop. We both have external monitors hooked up and external mice/keyboards, so we use the screen and the raw power and not so much the built-in keyboard/touchpad. We have both used it portable, though, and have had no real issues with those components.However, to really get the most out of the machine, in my opinion you must immediately replace the HDD with an SSD (or leave the original and pop in an m.2 SSD), upgrade the ram from 8GB to 16GB of a higher quality stick, and if you plan on using this laptop wirelessly - ever - replace the absolute garbage Qualcomm chip inside. I replaced the HDD and ram with crucial components, a BX model for myself and MX for the wife, plus their great DDR ram. The wi-fi cards we replaced with Intel 8260ac cards. The SSD and ram I installed immediately after getting the machines, but it took us 2 months to finally decide enough is enough for the wifi cards and replace them with the Intels. We had constant disconnects, speed drops, and blue screens relating to the Qualcomm QCA61x4s. If you do some google searching you'll find plenty of results of people unhappy with those chips. Once we replaced them in the Intel 8260s our wifi has been rock solid, fast, stable.Now fully upgraded these laptops rock. There hasn't been anything we could throw at them that hasn't been handled fast and effective. Reboots take seconds. Games load in moments. My wife will have the entire adobe suite up and then some and no slow down, no waiting. Games run fast, and are playable at high or ultra settings depending on how demanding the title. We were just blowing through the Overwatch Beta Weekend on this thing and had a blast, it ran it like a champ. You can hear some fan whir at max load, but that's nothing surprising for a laptop with this much power. Make sure you put it on an aluminum stand or pedestal with some ventilation and it'll run within acceptable temp ranges.I do feel I have to mention the upgrade process is not for the novice. Anyone with some patience and sense can do it, but if you get squeamish pulling apart a laptop and removing the mainboard - which is what you have to do to reach the ram (the SSD and wifi are easier to get to) then maybe find a friend who you trust to do the work or find a machine that needs less work to maximize its true potential. If you're like me, however, and cracking open the guts is all a part of the fun and adventure of PC ownership, then go for it. You won't be disappointed in the performance.",8,8

Other than that, the WASD keyboard area and the entire rest of the laptop stays cool while the touch pad stays COLD. The cooling in my opinion is handled very well. Overall it's thin, lightweight, and powerful and I give it two big thumbs up."," -The fans can get pretty loud during gaming but it needs to cool this thing laptop down. This has never bothered me but it might bother you. -My left fan has some noticeable scratching noise (which hasn't affected cooling or performance so far) but it can cause some concerns. While it spins maybe it rubs against the bottom of the laptop case or something.-The arrow keys on the keyboard feel very mushy compared to the rest of the laptop which feels clicky.-The left hinge cover on my laptop makes a lot of clicking noises (which bothers me in some way but doesn't seem to have any functional problems or cause damage). Whenever I open the laptop it clicks a bit and especially when I close the laptop it clicks a lot. If i push on the left hinge cover it squeaks and moves while the right one is completely solid. Again, it doesn't feel like it is going to break and it feels solid but the squeaks and clicks are audible."," I don't play very graphic intensive games but here is the list of games that I tried.-Starcraft 2 Maxed out (about 110 fps)-Diablo 3 Maxed out (idk, runs smooth like butter though)-Tera Online Maxed out (Some lag spikes during loading a big city or town but other than that it runs good. Might need to put in high)-Minecraft (Obviously this runs no problem but what surprised me was that it was smooth even with the unbelievable shader mods. Chunks had to be set to 16 chunks though)-Black ops 2 Maxed Out (No problems)-Call of Duty Ghosts High Settings (I only tried high settings and it ran smooth. Didn't bother to try maxed because this game is horrible and badly optimized)-Garry's Mod Maxed Out (No problems)-Trove Maxed out( No problems)ONE MORE NOTE: My Nvidia GTX 960m was not working until I restarted my laptop after first boot. Make sure you get all your updates done and everything set up and restart your laptop. Good stuff.",12,12

Great Price for the laptop and does everything I would want and more.The ram was only 8gb, my laptop was a single stick of 8 so I bought an additional 8 to pair with it so it now has 16 and its noticeably quicker and smoother getting in and out of things.The large 1tb hdd was okay, not fast not horribly slow. I took advantage of the m.2 slot and put a mushkin ssd in the slot. The computer now boots under 10 seconds and has no issues.All in all a great laptop and worth the money."," The laptop when gaming runs hot, I mean hot!!!!! but I use it with a cooling pad and when that is done it runs smooth with no issues so I wouldnt be turned away from that. Just know it will get hot!The 4 speakers sound great, they are downward facing which is a bit different but the sound and quality make up for that placement.Even with those two cons it is still a fantastic laptop.

Powerful 4 cores i7 with hyperthreading. Comes with 8 gigs of ram, 1TB hard drive. The 960m is also pretty decent, I don't play any demanding games on this laptop because I have my main rig for that. But the 960m is able to max out any game before 2015 with high/ultra settings. I upgraded the ram to 16 gig and replaced the hard drive with 850 evo ssd now the laptop boots up in about 5 secs. The upgrades really help the laptop to perform at it's full potential."," The hard drive is really slow, took over a min to boot up. Once replaced with an ssd, the laptop become super snappy and fast.Upgrading this device is a pain, you have to remove the keyboard, unplug decent amount of wires and have to left the motherboard up to  access the ram. Not beginner friendly at all, but don't let it scare you. Its doable.Another con i experienced with this laptop is heat, this laptop tends to run into a lot of thermal throttling with cause the gpu and cpu to run at a lower speed to reduce heat output which has a big impact on the performance."," Overall I would still recommend this laptop to others, Its decently priced (Not over 1000 like others 960m), fairly light, easy to use and pretty powerful. You just need to replace the slow hard drive.",4,4

Other than that, this model is virtually identical to model I own. Some games may perform slightly different on 2GB model.So I bought this laptop a little before Black Friday for around $899 and even at that price point, I felt I got a good deal for what I got in this package. The current price for this model with the 2GB GTX 960M is around $759, which is a steal and no-brainer to buy. First off this bad boy plays most games, especially from 2013 and 2014 and earlier, at 1080p 60 FPS. Some newer games, especially if poorly optimized, you may have to lower settings some but will still play at 1080p 40 FPS. If you are wondering about certain games, here are some of the games I have tested:Dark Souls II SOTFS: Max, 60 FPSDarksiders II Deathinitive Edition: Med, 40+ FPSDmC: Ultra, 60 FPSDragon Age Inquisition: Med, 60 FPSFallout 3: Ultra, 60 FPSFinal Fantasy Type-0: Standard Preset, 30 FPS (capped)Guilty Gear Xrd: Max, 60 FPSLightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII: Max, 60 FPS (dips to 40)Lords of The Fallen: High, 40 FPSTales of Zestiria: Max, 30 FPS (capped)If you don't have any of the above games or interested in a different game, you can very easily find benchmarks for almost any popular game on notebookcheck.com. The GTX 960M is one of the most popular GPUs out on the market now due to it's overall affordability, cool temps (relatively) and mid-range performance power. However, while there are lots of variants of different brand and model laptops in the wild with this same GPU, none are at this price point and will usually run you at least $100-200+ more. My one recommendation to get better performance power out of this thing with the current specs is to take the money you saved and buy and install an M.2 SSD (recommend at least 128GB for OS and games, apps) and use the 1TB drive as a storage drive. While SSDs are still higher price/GB than HDDs, they've gotten more affordable and will greatly increase the performance of your laptop (boot times, loading times, app starting time) PRO-TIP: Make sure once you install said SSD, go into the BIOS and find the drive listed in BIOS. Change your UEFI Secure Boot settings to Unsecured (you will have to set a password for this). Otherwise you won't find the drive recognized in OS when you start your machine. That being said, the upgrade process is bit of bear for the average user. While I am not a computer hardware guru or professional laptop repair, I consider myself to have more tech knowledge than the average person as I have owned and upgraded numerous laptops in my time (RAM upgrades, HDD to SSD upgrades, HDD replacements, etc.) and this one has been one of the more hassle upgrade processes in my experience. You have to pry the edges of the keyboard from the chassis in certain areas and then lift the keyboard from the chassis, versus removing screws and an access panel on the bottom like most laptops. That is for the SSD, which once opened up the slot is pretty accessible. RAM upgrades are a little more difficult as you have to not only remove the keyboard, but also the motherboard from it's mounts to access the RAM slots. However, there are videos on Youtube (not all in English but easy enough to follow) that show you how to do this but if the thought of doing this kind of stuff makes your blood run cold, caveat emptor or you may want to hire someone more comfortable with doing laptop disassembly and upgrades to do it for you. Once the upgrade was completed though, it's totally worth it as boot and load times are so much faster. Hardware wise I have had no issues with this machine in the 3+ months I have owned it. I had one OS issue that was caused by upgrade to Windows 10 and some driver issues afterwards causing blue screens. I did a clean install of the OS and have had zero issues since. These models come with Windows 10 pre-installed so you should have no such issues. The other thing to be aware of is Acer ships these with a bunch of crud / bloat ware. Either download PC Decrapifier (free) software or do a clean install of Windows 10 and download the needed drivers (make sure you get right Wifi drivers for your adapter) and problem solved. It's just a shame PC and laptop manufacturers do this. I realize it's partially how they get by with selling these laptops as cheap as they do, but it does detract from the experience and is something to be aware of. Overall, I am very happy with the performance of this laptop and the value I got it for and would recommend this to others (I actually have to one of my friends who is buying this very model). In the words of Shia Lebouf: ""What are you waiting for? Just do it!""",15,15

Be careful not to over-extend the tiny connector for the SD card reader when you separate the halves.  Removal of the HDD and replacement with an SSD was straight-forward.

Horrible. Run away! The first one I got died completely literally within a few days. Like blue screen of death, restoring to factory settings could not save it. Acer told me I could send it to them for repair or contact Newegg for a replacement since it died so quickly. I chose that route. Newegg was great about it. They rushed shipping and everything. Problem is, the computer that I was given as a replacement was almost as bad. The tab key was not even fully snapped into place when I got it. Its still skewed weird, there are crazy graphics that pop up on my screen around the edges of windows all the time, and the graphics driver kept crashing and recovering among other things. After dealing with Acer's customer service 4 or 5 times (one of the people was incredibly rude by the way) I finally got a driver installed that seemed to help for a while, but it has still crashed a couple times since then. Now, my touchpad won't work! Its almost like it is sticking constantly and things are moving and resizing and freaking out with me not even touching it. I finally had to connect a regular mouse and disable the touchpad to get it to stop freaking out (even using just the regular mouse with the touchpad enabled it was still freaking out, so disabling was a must). I'm so frustrated to own this piece of junk. Guess I'll be calling Acer tomorrow, and I'm sure they'll tell me i have to send it in. Great. So I get to be without a laptop. AGAIN. My first laptop I ever owned was an Acer about 10 years ago, and I loved it. If this is the quality they are putting out now though, I will be replacing this one with another brand. Unfortunately probably sooner rather than later.",,0,2

My 8  year old core 2 duo laptop boots faster into Win 10, I am not comparing this to a laptop with an SSD. Poor viewing angles of screen, washed out colors even with optimal viewing angles.  Slow program loading.

The specs on this machine are delusional compared to its real world performance.

9SIA9B54NX5505,34-315-302,6/18/2016 10:17:36 AM,Kevin M.,Best Performance Per Dollar,4," Purchased this over a month ago, so I'm still in a honeymoon period.  So far so good (if it dies in the next few months, I will replace this with a scathing review.  Hopefully, that won't happen...knock on wood).  Bottom line, this is the most bang for your buck.  - The dedicated graphics card they provide (GeForce 940M) at this price point is what impressed me the most.  I can play most games in my steam library (examples: Skyrim, Alien Isolation, Shogun 2, Arkham Origins) on high settings with acceptable framerates (I just reduce the resolution to 720p.  You hardly notice with the screen they've provided).  Also, it's a DirectX 12 GPU with PhysX support (you will notice this feature when you play Arkham Origins.  Lots of particles and effects).  I can average about 25 FPS playing Assassin's Creed - Black Flag on medium/high settings at 720p.   NOTE - open the Nvidia control panel and assign your games to run on the dedicated graphics card (GeForce 940M) instead of the integrated graphics card.  - The computer comes with 8GB of RAM which is more than enough.  The CPU (i5 6200U) is no slouch either.  - If you obsess over smudges then you'll love the textured plastic.  Also, the amount of plastic they use, makes it very light.  Dissipates heat well...I assume (I've never felt this thing get really hot).  - Connects to my Bluetooth headphones without issue.  - No optical drive.  Yes, that is a plus because it leaves plenty of space for another hard drive.  Seriously, when was the last time you used a CD for...well, anything?"," - Let's face it.the screen is garbage (despite being 1080p).  The contrast is abysmal.  If you're watching a movie with lots of dark shots, you'll have a hard time figuring out what's going on.  - The Hard Disk Drive (HDD) they include is an antique at this point (1TB at 5400 RPM).- The speakers are on the bottom (a bit counter-intuitive when you think that this is a computer designed to sit on your lap (hence ""laptop"").  You'll need headphones.- Windows 10 does not support Ad Hoc connections (wireless PC to PC).- Having no access panel is a nightmare.  You'll need to remove 21 screws to get to the guts of this thing.  NOTE - the speakers are attached to the bottom panel and tethered to the motherboard so be careful when taking it off.  You'll need thin plastic to pop open the seams (I used my driver's license).  Also, remove the retaining screw and slide out the optical drive placeholder first.  Beneath that are three additional screws you need to remove to access the motherboard.   - It only has three USB ports.  Considering you will need one for the mouse dongle, that leaves you with two.  If you don't have a wireless printer, that leaves you with one.  If you're using an Xbox controller, that leaves you with none.  If you're using an external HDD to back up files, unplug something.  Only three peripherals (I may be getting a bit to pedantic here).  Also, the USB ports are towards the front.  So your cords and peripherals are, more or less, in the way; consuming surface space.", I upgraded the HDD and installed the OS on a 120GB Solid State Drive (SSD) from my old computer.  I upgraded the RAM to 16GB as well (the extra slot is vacant: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148679).  If you want to add an extra HDD for storage you'll need a drive caddy (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817986024&cm_re=Vantec_SSD%2fHDD_Aluminum_Caddy-_-17-986-024-_-Product).

I5 6200U is more than capable for “everyday computing” and can handle large excel spreadsheets, matlab, and mathematica without any issue. 940M allows it to even handle some light gaming.1080p screen is leagues above the competition, most are running 768p at this price point and size.Textured plastic body seems to be polarizing, but I’m not bothered by it. It keeps the laptop reasonably light and it’s very fingerprint resistant.The empty optical drive slot has a slim sata connector, you can opt for a dual-drive system if you pick up a 9.5mm caddy.Laptop doesn’t get too hot, CPU and GPU both run reasonably cool which also means the fan doesn’t have to turn on often.Wifi card works well and is using the newest widely available standard (802.11 w/ MU-MIMO)Webcam and mic are passable. Keyboard with a number pad is a huge plus for me, squished up/down arrows and lack of caps/num/scroll lock indicators are unfortunate though."," People aren’t exaggerating when they say opening this to upgrade the internals is a pain. There’s over a dozen screws, including 3 hidden under the optical drive placeholder. Once you do manage to remove the back all the components are readily accessible.Speakers are downward-firing and generally disappointing.Only 3 USB ports, would’ve been nice to have an extra one on the right side, there’s definitely room.Battery life and keyboard feel are meh.Screen contrast is sub-par, even by TN standards, but if that’s a trade-off for better resolution I’m happy to make that compromise (you may disagree)Bloatware paired with the slow, pre-installed HDD make for some long boot times."," Cannot recommend upgrading to an SSD enough. $50 extra bucks can get you a 120GB skew that will drastically improve boot times and general snappiness and a caddy so you can use the HDD for mass storage.If you decide to install something in the optical drive slot, note that it will be secured by a screw on the outside of the caddy, made sure to get the installation right the first time so you don’t have to open up the laptop again to fix it.A lot of people are talking about upgrading to 16GB of RAM like it’s a necessity. If you’re not too familiar with computers and don’t know if you should upgrade immediately, chances are you don’t need more than the 8GB that this comes with by default. Definitely prioritize the upgrade to a SSD.Amazing laptop for a college student on a budget.",28,28

I looked for over two weeks to find the best laptop to do software development, school projects, and some gaming. This one was by far the best. Memory (RAM), storage space, and the precision track-pad are all really nice. The screen is 1080p and looks stunning while gaming. I ran Civilization 5 on max settings and got 40 fps.  Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim gets 24 fps on max settings. Windows 10 Home is pre-installed. Much better than Windows 8. I've been using Windows 10 since it was released, and I'm pleased I didn't have to upgrade this machine when I turned it on out of the box.Laptop body is textured to reduce smudges.HDMI / VGA / USB 3.0 ports. Also has SD card reader, ethernet, and headphone/mic port (see cons on headset port).UPDATE: I've had the laptop for about a week now, and I have to say the processor speed is amazing. The page says 2.3 ghz, but the label on the laptop mentions ""Turbo Boost"" up to 2.8 ghz. And it does give out 2.3 ghz when you're really multitasking. Much, much better than I had expected, this thing is fast. Also, there is a ""hibernation"" fast start mode, that lets you save the status of your drivers and OS, but still powers off, so that you can start up faster. This option is enabled by default on mine. Start up was a bit slow for the first few days as it was updating things constantly, but now that its been ""settled in"" it can start up in under half a minute or so.","  There are a few pieces of bloatware, but nothing serious and I've managed to deal with it. Doesn't take much to set this laptop up.Keyboard quality is typical laptop quality (in other words, low), but isn't terrible. The ""fn"" (Function key) doesn't feel right (slight clicky feeling when I hit it), but I think it just needs to get broken in after some use.Speakers are located on the bottom of the laptop, so not the best sound results. Also speaker volume in general isn't very high, but its enough to get by. Headphones recommended. Only one audio port. Functions for both headphones and microphone, so if you have a gaming headset that needs two ports (one for audio out, one for the mic) you might need to give up the headset mic and use the built in webcam mic. Or you could get some sort of splitter / converter cable. Power button is just another key on the keyboard. A little weird, and not my personal preference. Its right above the number pad, so keep that in mind when you buy it (you could accidentally put yourself in hibernate mode). If you find yourself hitting the power button by accident, just go into the power settings and set the power button to ""do nothing"" when pressed if the machine is already on.No optical (CD / DVD) drive. There is a slot to install one, however. Or you can put in an SSD like many reviewers have.

The 'pre-installed' programs are worthless and should be uninstalled. Had issues with HD Intel Graphics driver crashing (had to call Newegg and Intel tech support). Since Windows 10 is new, some drivers don't work well since needing more updates/patches. The NumLock and CapsLock signals do not appear on the keyboard area because there are none (meaning: typically there are little LED lights that light-up when these are on). Little frustrating when you use Num keys often and you start typing to realize NumLock is off.", I bought extra Ram for 16bg available (X1 Corsair 8gb + 8gb that comes with computer).

This is right up our alley. Get shoprunner for a couple days till it arrives then cancel for free 2 day shipping.-CPU is alright.- Decent GFX card. Can run most of my Steam library at high settings, but I turn down Starcraft 2 as large battles affect frames. Rocket League was OK, but I turned all the settings down for split-screen. Very few dedicated GFX cards at this price point. I typically just mess around with stuff like Factorio in class and my SO plays Stardew Valley on it when I'm at her place.- Lightweight for a 15inch laptop.

You may not care. - Wifi adapter is not made of fail.-Screen is OK. LED backlit LCD with reasonable viewing angles. For situations where viewing angles even come into the equation you should be hooking this female dog up to a TV with the included HDMI port anyways.- Fan is quiet. If you are seriously going to game with this thing get a $15 dollar usb cooling pad as it gets quite warm.- Boots sub 10 seconds with an SSD. 240 GB cost me 60 bucks, well worth it,-RAM will not be your bottleneck. It will be CPU or GFX card. I would upgrade to an SSD before you stick 16gbs of RAM in there that you will never use. BUY A SLIM CADDY I had to alter mine with tin snips and it still doesn't fit quite right. You want a slim one that is totally rectangular and does not have any weird angles on it. Check the other reviews and QA for caddy suggestions do not use the newegg suggested stuff.-Really a good deal for the internals.

Touchpad, as per current trends, is off-center and underneath the spacebar. I disabled mine since...-The touchpad sucks. Clicking is loud. Gets accidentally activated when typing with my fat hands.

In conclusion  I have not had issues with the laptop it works great for school and light gaming. The fans are not loud and the laptop does not get  hot if your using on your lap.

I had to remove the entire bottom plate to replace the HDD with an SSD and the RAM modules.-Keyboard not back-lit (I knew this going in), no numlock/capslock indicator lights).-Keys have very little travel (my Acer 1410 Netbook has significantly more) and is causing some fatigue until I get used to this. Certain keys have no travel (backspace) due to construction underneath preventing travel (but I could have a defective device).-Acer elected to lock down the BIOS and prevent disabling of secureboot, quietboot, and quickboot options and enabling of numlock on boot. This is probably my biggest issue, but forgivable since I can work with it with some modifications.-Non-user-replaceable battery.

I think it has to do with me having an SSD in it so everything loads fast and plays fast so it doesn't tax the machine like the old 5400RPM drive did but I've played for hours and the laptop barely got too hot for my lap but I used the cooler anyway more to keep it cool than to protect my legs from heat, it simply didn't get hot enough to burn them like most laptops would have.

Win 8 = dumb ""user friendly"" settings that are the opposite, i.e. NumLock doesn't automatically turn on at startup- Trackpad off center towards the left.

Still has good battery life, though I am usually plugged in using AC adapter and prefer a dim screen- Chiclet keys not as flat/low profile as other laptops- Adapter port seems loose, but it’s not. Though the plug fits snugly, you can jiggle it up and down- Eject battery mechanism is difficult if you don’t have long nails, but at least it does it’s job of preventing accidental battery removal.

I've had no issues with any development work, running multiple virtual machines, multimedia work including video editing, and some gaming.  For the sale price of $629 I got it at, I couldn't have asked for anything better."," - For the first month after purchasing, I dealt with the built-in Atheros wifi card continuously dropping my connection, an issue that persisted upon multiple driver installs and multiple clean formats and reinstalls of Windows.  I gave up and bought a Broadcom chip instead, and still never got the same connection speeds I could get with other devices on the same network, which made me think the issue was motherboard related rather than the network adapter or software.- Adding to my suspicions of the motherboard's quality, it later developed a new problem where typing too hard in a particular spot (around the T key) would instantly crash the computer, with ""too hard"" meaning normal typing pressure.  As a programmer, this was infuriating beyond all belief.  It turns out that a metal 'foot' on the underside of the keyboard in this spot had scratched away and exposed a copper connection on the motherboard, shorting it out whenever they came into contact.  I remedied this with a piece of tape over both the 'foot' and the spot on the motherboard that was scratched, though the multiple times this happened may have contributed to the last two issues.- Undeterred in its plans to infuriate me, it later developed an issue where it would power off in my backpack when left in sleep mode and refuse to turn back on.  The power lights would come on and the fans would spin, but the screen remained off and the hard drive would click and stop spinning after a few moments, after which it turned off and tried again to boot.  This problem could be fixed by removing the keyboard, which makes me think it was still shorting out somehow because it would then boot normally with the cover unscrewed and removed.  It didn't do this often at all, and it's survived many other trips in a bag with no issues.- The final straw occurred with the same problem as the last point, except that time it failed to come back to life.  I didn't even get a power light or fans, either with battery or AC power.  The repair cost would have been over half of what I paid, presumably for a motherboard replacement as it could not longer even charge the battery either.  I'm opting for an ASUS laptop instead this time, rather than paying the repair cost for it to inevitably find a new way to break."," This is a very good computer.  Really, it is.  It handled everything I needed it to like a champ.  I don't know if I'd buy it again though, and certainly not at the current price it's at now.  I don't know if my issues were due to a manufacturer defect or because of clumsiness during all the times I had to poke around with its insides (which were purely to fix the problems it was giving me to begin with), but I later read that Acer is somewhat known for its reputation in failing laptops and low build quality.  This died in under a year and a half.  I can't entirely blame Acer as I should probably have gotten the thing looked at or replaced earlier on, but a design where the keyboard support 'feet' could scratch at and short the motherboard should never have been able to pass quality assurance in the first place.",None,None

We all know the spces I5, 8GB RAM, 2GB GeForce 840m with a 1TB HDD etc.The I5 is nice, it's fast, efficent and more than gets the job done. This thing plays new games at decent quality (e.g. Far Cry 4) at a decent rate. You will have to tweak settings a bit but it's worth it. Screen is nice for what it is. However the HDMI port allows you to connect to a nice 1080p monitor/TV. The aluminum look is well done. The keyboard is nice, spacious and well laid out. The laptop is very light and easy to carry it feels solid. The unit I've got runs cool approx 25c - 35c with the GPU at 45c+ at full load. The WiFi has presented no issues what soever in the month+ that I've had it."," It has to be said the one major con is the mechanical hard drive. It's slow, it's big (which is good) but it's so horribly slow. It's pegged at 100% for the first 10 or so minutes after it starts. No updates being downloaded/installed. The likely cause are services running in the background. I dumped it for an SSD and the problem was solved.If you plan to upgrade the HDD or the RAM be prepared. There's no panels under the laptop to remove for easy access. You have to remove all the screws on the underside of the laptop then very gently pry the plastic keyboard/upper case away from the lower case. Once done gently open the case and carefully disconnect the three ribbon cables. Now you can access the HDD. If you want at the RAM, remove the motherboard and you'll find it on the other side. Yes you have to tear your laptop apart to upgrade the RAM you better be happy with 8GB or skilled with electronics.", I dumped the mechanical drive in favor of an SSD that was on sale here at NewEgg. 240GB of SSD later and I'm on my desktop in approx 10 seconds.

The 840M performs realy well, and can play games like Black Ops 2 or Battlefield Bad Company 2 on almost max settings, but pales in the face of games like Far Cry 4. GTA V will be a tough cookie to crack for this one. This computer is really good for light gamers or performance enthusiasts. The bezel and palm rest area is made of what looks like brushed aluminum, and is pleasing to the touch. The lid cover is made out of plastic that is supposed to match, presumably to cut down on the weight factor. However, these surfaces will attract dirt and grime like no other, and the light color will let it show, so make sure that you carry a screen cleaning cloth with you to touch up on it every no and again. The battery should last well past the quoted 7 hours. I am pleased with this laptop and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a really nice laptop without breaking the bank. This thing runs really cool, like a maximum of 64 degrees Celsius under full load. Also, I would recommend downloading the ""GeForce Experience"" from Nvidia: it will help you keep your drivers completely up to date and will even tell you some settings to run your games at for optimal performance, which isn't always spot on. I notice on Battlefield Bad Company 2 that it showed me settings that would result in about 30fps, which is low for that kind of game. But that is still considered playable, so I suppose if you do not NEED 60fps constantly then the recommended settings will do fin. All in all, you can't go wrong with this laptop. If you wanna check how this thing operates, check out Game Debate, search a game, and enter the specs to see a pretty accurate analysis of how it will run some games.",None,None

The computer can really let loose without that 5400 RPM HDD holding it back. Battery life is excellent as well. After installing an SSD, 6 hours of Netflix only registers about 40% battery drain. This is going to be great on those cross country airline trips."," Not maintenance friendly at all. The Acer engineers definitely didn't consider users wanting to install aftermarket parts. There's no access slots for...anything. Rather than a removable bottom, the screws actually hold down the bezel for the keyboard and mousepad. Lifting up this bezel is how you gain access to anything, and it is connected to the mainboard with 4 extremely short, extremely fragile ribbon cables. Needless to say, getting at anything on the inside is a very delicate, very time consuming operation.Also, the lack of an optical drive means you'll need a USB flash drive to run any kind of boot-time HDD cloning software should you make the switch to an SSD."," This laptop isn't bad at all.

It would work anywhere from 5 minutes to two hours at most, then cease all connection activity while remaining connected to the Wifi network.

Getting to the HDD and other components is somewhat of a pain but after you do it once, its a snap. See below."," I have read about how people got this thing open but I wanted to cover it all since its a little tricky.First, you need to remove ALL the screws on the bottom. You need to also take the battery out. You then can separate the keyboard section from the bottom of the laptop. You do this by slowly separating around all the edges. I started doing this where the battery connects to the laptop. Once you have it all separated you can lift the keyboard section up. Make sure you do this SLOWLY as there are 3 ribbon cables connected to the motherboard. There are small clip mechanisms that hold this ribbons in place -flip them to unlock the cable and pull apart. The hard drive is covered by another ribbon cable that needs to be disconnected. Finally you unscrew two screws and the hdd bracket will come out. There are two screws holding the hdd in the bracket which also needs to be removed.I got lucky because the OEM hdd (WD10JPVX) height is 9.5mm and the SSD I had to replace it was also 9.5mm.I was able to do a fresh install of windows 8.1 with a USB flash drive. However, the bios would only boot to it in legacy mode.After that the OS install was easy and it did not require activation since the key is tied to the bios.

This is my only serious complaint. The heat from the GPU vents out the bottom and LEFT side of the laptop. When you are playing a PC game, and your hand is sitting on WASD, your hand will get hot.

Just a quick example of what it can do; I get an average of 55 FPS on Battlefield 4 on medium at 1280x768 on medium settings. I average 70 FPS at 1280x768 on low settings.Star Wars The Old Republic I average 100+ at 1366x768 on high settings. TES: Oblivion averages around 70 FPS at 1366x768... I believe it was medium settings. I haven't tried Skyrim yet, but I'm sure it will be more than playable on medium. (All of the above was without AA of course.)This notebook has decent boot speeds. It's not nearly as quick as a 7200 rpm HDD or an SSD, of course, but it's fast enough if one isn't picky.The Wi-Fi worked perfectly out of the box.The sound is actually pretty amazing for a notebook. I haven't owned many notebooks, but its sound is the best I've heard from one. This laptop stays cool... even after an hour of Battlefield 4. I don't foresee much of an overheating problem so long as it's used on a flat surface and has the space to breath."," The 5400 RPM HDD is the biggest con for me. I'm spoilt with an SSD for my desktop. Obviously, there is a night and day difference. The only other thing I can knock is the lack of a disc drive. I bought an external disc drive to go with it.", Consider a 500GB or 1TB SSD as an upgrade. I've ordered a 1TB SSD for an upgrade.,2,2

9SIA0AJ3F05766,34-314-535,7/22/2014 1:52:30 PM,Stephan M.,Bang for your buck,5," My friend has had this laptop for 2 months, and it blazes through everything he's tried to put it through.  For a laptop with a graphics chip, you are paying without a doubt the smallest penny that it can be sold for.  Go do some research and it is obvious that you will not find a laptop with a current generation Nvidia chipset any cheaper.  That being said, there are obviously going to be some drawbacks due to the price range.  The screen resolution is not the absolute highest.  This is a 15.6"" screen.  Not a 17"".  You're buying portability.  You're buying lightweight.  You're buying cheap.  And yet, you're adamant that you want to be able to max out the graphics on modern games.  This laptop is perfect for this.  For this price range, you're getting a laptop that will tear through current and next gen graphics that is nearly as powerful as a desktop for the same price.  You can't beat this deal.  I see so many people spending 600 bucks on new laptops that slow down to a crawl within a month of use, have no graphics card, slow memory, and they wonder why my friend's laptop for the same price can blow theirs out of the water every time.  A computer is only as fast as its slowest component, and if you completely leave out one component, it's obvious what happens.  So this laptop lasts.  Windows 8 is acceptable, however we wish we could install windows 7 instead with full driver support."," Windows 8 is still largely, in my humble opinion, not finished.  It's buggy and it's full of garbage and changes that aren't needed.  It was sold as a way to milk more money out of computer users.  I've said the same thing about most of the versions of windows since XP was released.  It took 2 service packs to finally fix XP to a usable state.  Vista never reached fixed status, and windows 7 is actually decent.  Windows 8 was designed for touchscreens, and seeing as how not all laptops are touchscreen capable, and not all users wish to utilize the touchscreen, this windows has all the bugs of new technology with none of the advantages of it.Second is the screen resolution.  1366x768 isn't terrible.  this is a 15.6"" screen, which is rather small.  You're going to be using the screen within a few feet of your face.  so much like a smartphone, you don't need 1080p resolution for such a small screen to have an excellent picture.  of course, the absolute BEST picture would be the higher resolution, but you don't want to drop $1500 on a laptop.  You're not buying the best.  But you are buying the best for your limited budget.  That is why I am leaving this issue out of my overall cons."," You want power, performance, and portability.  You want a low price.  You can't possibly get any more of the first three for a price this low.  You want a laptop that will last you 2-3 years at least.  This can last you 5 if you don't physically abuse it and keep it clean.  You don't want to have to do a system restore every month to make your computer run at anything faster than a crawl.  This can run for months without a hiccup.  This laptop will not only be around the same price as a far weaker laptop you can find at best buy, but will also save on maintenance costs over time, especially if you aren't techy enough to be able to diagnose your own laptop or do your own system restore.  Computers are expensive.  Do yourself a favor and make this your next buy.",6,6
9SIA0AJ3F05766,34-314-535,7/21/2014 11:47:27 AM,Lisa B.,Plenty of Power for the Price,5," I purchased this laptop as a replacement to a high powered Asus 17"" gaming laptop. My focus was on longevity and power while staying under $700. We'd all like to drop $1500 on a laptop that can make your desktop blush, but I simply couldn't afford to do that. This laptop has everything I wanted from it. It is light, fully half the weight of my old computer, and much more comfortable to use more spaces (I DM Dungeons and Dragons, and this is far easier to accomodate at my table than my old 17"" beast).I am not a cutting-edge gamer, but this PC runs Civ 5, X-Com, and Tera without a hiccup."," The only thing I would consider a drawback on this PC is the resolution. However, I'm not docking any stars from its rating for that. I knew what I was buying right from the start, and I decided the lower resolution was a worthwhile tradeoff to get the processor, RAM, and form-factor I wanted for the price I wanted.", Strongly recommend this PC for the middle-budget laptop gamer. My wife bought one from the same product line with a little less power for even cheaper. High quality for a great price.,10,10
9SIA0AJ3F05766,34-314-535,7/10/2014 10:03:19 AM,Neil M.,Overall good laptop,4," - Good i5 processor and plenty of enough ram for a solid performance overall.- Mid-range Gpu. Able to play League of Legends, DoTA 2 and Borderlands 2 all above 60 fps on low to medium quality throughout. Don't expect to run any super high quality games perfectly though. -Solid keyboard. Feels very nice to type on and the number pad is good for excel, work stuff etc.-Good camera, able to Skype with friends and family just fine. -Stays cool overall. Only noticed it become somewhat warm during extended gaming sessions. - Good battery life. From travel I got a good 6 - 8 hours after each charge doing work or just surfing the web."," - Didn't really delve into the touch-pad but from the time I used it it felt very finicky to me. Felt extremely strange from just pressing on it as the pad feels somewhat stuck when pressing down. Of course this is solved from just using a separate mouse.- As to expect, the display is somewhat meh. With a 1366 x 768 resolution some things on the screen can look very pixelated and lower quality. Its not very noticeable unless you've seen a higher resolution but those who are very picky of there quality, I would stay away. - Felt speakers were a bit below average but nothing to deem it terrible. I'm primarily a headphone user so take that into account. Also bloatware, 5400RPM HD and no CD/DVD drive but that shouldn't be that much of a a problem as it can be solved easily.", Overall this is a solid mainstream laptop able to do work as well as some gaming on the side. I got this during a lower price point so regardless of the cons I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase. However if your looking for the same laptop with a better display resolution (which I highly recommend) you should just put down the extra money and get the Acer Aspire V3-572G-54L9 which boasts a 1920 x 1080 resolution.,6,6

9SIA0AJ52E4961,34-319-464,8/29/2016 11:46:59 AM,Adam S.,Great Laptop,5," I bought this laptop eight months ago. As others have said, it showed no signs of wear at all. The only issue mine had was what looked like a smudge on the screen. I could never get it out and determined it is actually something wrong with the pixels. That  said, it's only noticeable when the screen is dark. No other problems with it.It comes with a Windows license and Thinkpad software (some of it is necessary for operating the trackpoint and such). Nice plus.The T420 is the last Thinkpad (really laptop in general) with a good keyboard. It retains the navigation key cluster (delete, home, end, pg up, pg down) which is very important to me since all modern laptops have weird, inconsistent layouts. It also has dedicated media keys for volume and mute - a very nice touch."," The screen is really the only drawback to this laptop. It is small and a somewhat low resolution. Mine did come with an imperfection, but I'm assuming this is just my particular unit. It is a TN panel, so the viewing angles are not great. It is a matte finish, so glare is not much of an issue.The trackpoint is very nice; however, I have noticed it has a tendency to stick in one directly slightly a drift the cursor sometimes."," At $200, you really can't go wrong with this. It's about as cheap as a chromebook, and you're getting a lot more computer out of it, despite the fact that it's a 5 year old model. I upgraded mine with an SSD and 16 GB of RAM. The product spec sheet says it only supports 8 GB, but that's because 8 GB DIMMS were not available when this laptop was released. It definitely supports 16 GB of RAM.Just a warning: since upgrading it to Windows 10, I have noticed some issues that were not present with Windows 7. Sometimes, the trackpad will stop working for a few seconds randomly in the middle of use. When closing the lid and putting it to sleep, sometimes it will never wake up and requires a full hard reboot, making me lose any work I had open. Much of the Lenovo software is not compatible with Windows 10 and does not have an equivalent for the T420 on the Lenovo website; some of it really wasn't necessary anyway, so it's not a big deal.",None,None

Majority of them were it being in mint condition and a few reviews were negative. So I said screw it and bought it anyways. I have to say I am beyond happy with my purchase. It came in 3 days and when I opened the box it was in mint condition looked like it has never been used. Still had the plactic on the thinkpad logos. It was a breeze to activate windows and very fast and powerful. I have tested the battery and got about 6 1/2 hours of basic use from a charge. It looks pretty sleek as well. I have zero complains about the laptop. If you plan on using it heavily (like myself) then I would suggest slapping in a larger hard drive and ram to give you some extra power but it works awesome as it sits."," Could have came with a larger hard drive but I will be upgrading to a TB hard drive and 8gb ram over time, it works great otherwise", If you are sceptical about buying it don't be.

9SIA0AJ52E4961,34-319-464,8/4/2016 1:32:47 PM,Anonymous,Excellent Value,5," Overall a great laptop. I didn't even need a laptop when I bought this but I stumbled on it, saw the price and literally just said to myself, ""alright, let's see what it looks like when it shows up."" At worst I thought it might make a fun project. You're always taking a bit of a gamble with refurbs but mine was basically brand new.... No evidence of it being used at all. No scratches, no fingerprints, no idea why it was sent in for service. As soon as I got it I set about the task of upgrading it. It's okay when it arrives but is certainly not blazing fast with the stock specs (but it'll be fine for most casual users). The i5 processor is good. I upgraded the 4 gigs of memory (which comes with both slots filled in a 2x2 configuration) to 8 gigs (4x4). I also cloned the drive over to a new SSD and stored the old one away as an emergency backup. Both upgrades together make this a very powerful little computer with the only real drawback being lack of heavy-duty graphics performance.In terms of the case itself it's a very smart-looking and durable laptop and is also completely serviceable. It's built to be taken apart and worked on. I found a massive support community devoted to this exact model (including youtube vids, Lenovo's website and other places) and the full hardware manual is also available online."," Performance wise, the only real drawback is the graphics performance, which isn't really upgradable. But if you don't game, it's fine. It streams HD video to a large TV just fine.You'll want to think about purging Lenovo's bloatware and spyware. There's a program loaded on here that phones home to Lenovo every day with usage statistics which is a bit sneakily hidden. Search online for ""Lenovo Customer Feedback Program"" to learn about this and how to get rid of it - it involved some work in the task scheduler. The only Lenovo program I actually like on here is the battery manager which is somewhat handy. The rest of it I removed.",,None,None

It is the easiest unit to upgrade I ever owned.  So, for under $80, more good value shopping. I have a new long life battery, over 6 hours, 8gigs of ram, installed by myself, without tearing up the computer, and with a snap, I could if I wanted install a much larger hard drive which I don't need.  I love this computer. It comes with a fabulous warranty and they do answer their phone.  Not sure who the computer companies today are selling their over priced poorly loaded windows 10 units too, but there is no need to spend alot of money to get this terrific 420 from Newegg..

A simple quick start guide with info like the Win 7 license number is under the battery would also have been appreciated.Came with the 9 cell extended battery instead of the standard.Webcam is standard and no finger print reader.The Laptop seemed to be refurbished very well and in good shape. Keyboard shows finger tip ware and a few minor scratches and blemishes. I had purchased a 240 GB SSD and 4 GB of Ram to add to it.The T420 I received had 2 GB under the Keyboard and 2 GB under the Back panel.  I had hopped for one 4 GB so that adding the 4 GB would have gave me 8 GB. I now have 6 GB and it's running well.Windows Experience Index is 5.8 before and after the upgrades. This is because the Graphic controller is only 5.8 and limits the rating max.  I purchased a Multiport HDD caddy to put the original Hard drive in.I also purchased a USB 3.0 miniport Card that Gave me Two USB 3.0 ports that installed without issue.The Laptop was $199 when I purchased shipped and I added $100 worth of upgrades making it a really nice and Fast laptop with the Graphics as the limiting factor.The plastic Locking Tab switch for the Multiport bay fell out when I removed the DVD caddy to install the hard drive caddy in it's place.  It didn't break just fell out and is really hard to reinstall. It has a small pen type spring and getting it back without the spring falling out is a challenge. I tried a few times and gave up.

(*Spoilers this review is PG 16+ completely honest),5," -Very sturdy outer shell (I've always had plastic laptops and always ended up snapping the screen hinges within 4 months of heavy use)-Has built in latch/lock thing to hold the laptop closed when shut. (You wouldn't believe how many times I've broken a screen because the laptop would flip open sometimes in my bag and a pen would ninja its way between the glass and the keyboard. *In hindsight I should have invested in a laptop bag long ago)-I have to say that the battery life is vey nice, I can fully charge the system overnight and spend practically all day just browsing the web while listening to Spotify. Roughly 12 hours or so depending on whether or not I watch skin videos in between youtube videos because Newegg does no like the P word.-Compared to other laptops the sound from the speakers is ok, not the best, but I cant complain its a freaking WIN PAD YO!-The touchpad is very comfortable for me to use, it isn't hyper sensitive like others and the two sets of mouse buttons is actually useful!-It is a very very sturdy outer shell. Did I mention it isn't made out of plastic?", -I don't like that whenever I watch skin videos I have to be careful about where I leave fingerprints. The surface of the laptop is extremely difficult to clean if you know what I mean.-The amount of storage that it comes with is not enough for my uses. I download and cycle through dozens upon dozens of videos. I have needed to upgrade the storage on this puppy with an SSD. Look it up.," -Not so much a con but more of an annoyance, you can add more ram to the winpad if you want, just be ready to do some surgery. A simple search on youtube will show you how. -Also, the texture to the laptop is difficult to clean, but man does it look sexy. -Did I also mention I bought it for $200.00 after taxes and shipping?

If you find it on sale for under $200, it's pretty good.Lots of support in the Linux world.","  * It's a refurb, so don't expect a brand new device.* Be aware their are 2 different size hard drives.  7MM and 9.5MM.  Mine came with the 7MM and I was OK since I was swapping over to a SSD anyhow (which was also 7MM)  some 2.5"" drives won't fit properly unless you get the right size rubber rails (check e b a y).  *  Mine had some physical damage with the slide you use to physically eject the DVD-ROM drive broke after 1 use.  Seriously, not the eject button, but the slider to remove the DVD-ROM drive itself from the laptop broke!  Seems it's a common failure point on the T4XX series, so be aware of it.  I won't bother returning it because I won't be replacing the DVD-ROM with a secondary hard drive caddy (I just took it out to clean and inspect the device).* Some older Lenovo T-series allow you to swap the DVD-ROM drive for a second battery.  Sadly, you can't do that with this model.  Wish I had known that.* The battery that the laptop came with was in bad shape.  It held a charge for about a hour at 100%.  I figured that would happen, so I bought a factory sealed new one.  * You have to call in to activate Windows.  The automated phone system will handle activation for you easy enough, but I wish I wouldn't have had to go that route.* Mine came with a bad hard drive.  Over 400 bad sectors.  Really upset about that."," Not a bad computer, if you can overlook the flaws of buying refurbished.  Also since it's a bit older now you lose out on things like USB 3.0 and a integrated HDMI port (you do get a display port output, but you have to buy your own HDMI to DP adapter, so that stinks.)   If you are willing to throw in a SSD and maybe double the memory to 8 GB and give yourself a new battery, it's a sufficient machine for your Mom or Dad to browse the web with (or do your accounting or maybe, just maybe play some older games on.)

You can live with a signs of wear, sure, but you fear intermittent malfunctions or dead pixels or a battery that is close to unrechargable.  This was the opposite of that.  Thinkpads are known for their very high build quality and durability, and this one feels close to new, with the exception of the battery:  the Lenovo battery status app (preloaded along with all the std. ThinkPad extras) reports it as holding 49% of its original full capacity, which gets me 3 hours on a full charge."," Once you get to the Activate Windows screen during setup, you may have the same minor concern I did:  Microsoft initially reported that the product key (located underneath the battery, as promised) was out-of-date (or words to that effect), and gives you a few options, one of which is to try a different Windows product key.  I chose that option, re-entered the same number I entered initially, and all was well.  Yay."," Used or refurbished high-end business class laptops like the Lenovo ThinkPad T-series are often a better value than a new, cheap laptop, as long as you know what you're getting into (potential hard drive replacement or upgrade, lack of certain modern ports like USB 3.0 or HDMI).  I say, go for it.  Everything on this thing is easily serviceable.  It's built like a tank, and weighs almost as much, LOL.

This particular one has no shine at all on it so I am assuming it's a new replacement, however, there is not a scratch or bit of shine anywhere else on the unit, so it may be so lightly used that it just needed a reformat.The front edge has a VERY nice radius to it, enough that it doesn't bother the wrists when typing.  There is an ""odd"" as I've seen it termed, light for the keyboard, instead of a backlight.  I swore I'd never buy another laptop without a backlit keyboard again, but this little light is extremely useful.  It lights the keyboard and surrounding area, but does not bother my eyes, and I don't need some dongle hanging out of a USB port.  It's easy to find the keys to turn this on in the dark.  It's also very fast, just check the cpu benchmarks of this against the new 6th gen ones... you'll find the performance on par.  Video may be lacking in comparison, but if you're not crunching video or gaming... you'll do fine."," The keystrokes to turn on the keyboard light may be easy to find in the dark, (lower left and upper right buttons on keyboard) but if you are one-handing it because one arm is around your wife in bed, you'll wish the second button was within one-handed reach of the FN button.Lenovo's website is a bit harder than Dell's to find drivers for units that have a bare-bone windows install, but they are out there.The windows product key needed to be called in to activate it, but it went smoothly."," I would highly recommend this laptop.  OR there is one that has an I7 processor and SSD drive + 8 GB ram vs the 4GB ram in this one.  I do intend to bump the memory to 8GB one day, and the first thing I did was put in a 128GB SSD and clean-installed windows.  However, buying the i7 version would be easier and only a little more money once you buy the RAM and SSD.  I already had the SSD and didn't know of the i7 version at the time anyway, so it was easy for me.  I do some developing and needed a good keyboard that has DEDICATED function keys, not some extra function of the numbers row... this has it and they have the spaces between F4 and F5 etc.  Helpful.  Hands down the best keyboard I've used on ANY laptop.  I ALMOST don't need the light at night with this one.I thought I had a DOA at first... it quietly beeped a 1-3-3-1 code at boot.  I just needed to unseat/ reseat the RAM chip in the extra bay, and it worked.  HDD is easy to swap out.  hinges are nice and tight.",2,3

Before purchasing this, prepare a free ISO from Microsoft of Windows 10 and do a clean install. You'll be happy you did. Startup is smooth after that- laptop is not the prettiest you'll find, but it is sturdy enough and so long as you take good care of it, things should be fine"," - Contrary to popular belief, the laptop is actually very HD-looking. At startup, make sure to change magnification of W10 to just 100%. It defaults to 125%, leaving a lot of text and imagery blurry and not pretty. Anyone who finds this to be too small can change other settings like page magnify in web browsers, and I believe icon size can also be changed independent of text and other items if that's an issue for you.- As stated before, but bares repeating for anyone curious: Yes, there is a lot of bloatware at intro, but it's easily fixed with a clean W10 installation, so do that :)- As many others have stated, this is obviously not a hardcore gaming rig, but for those who like gaming on lower than highest settings, this lappy will do the trick. I've used it as a dedicated capture card computer, and it worked pretty well, and did not pull full resources from the cpu.",None,None

RUNS THE DIVISON MEDIUM SETTINGS OMGGG,5," - RUNS THE DIVISION ON UBISOFT'S PRESET MEDIUM SETTINGS, Average 30fps and VERY VERY Reactive to any mouse movements NO LAGS WHATSOEVER.= GREAT GPU, you can not get better for the money, and it makes the 950m and 960m scammers for their prices compared to this one.- Great cpu for most tasks including gaming- Battery is more than enough (I manage 5hrs on medium brightness, wifi web browsing and youtube)- Great screen 1080 resolution is very nice and sharp- Awesome keyboard which even includes numpad on a 15"" laptop which is very rare- The touch pad is (unlike all reviews say its bad) in my opinion VERY GOOD, it has very nice feeling to it and great gestures, AWESOME for browsing and using windows. You have to get used to it but it only took me 15mins to get all the little details about it.- 8GB out of the box IS MOOOORREEE THANN ENOUGH, YOU CAN DO PLENTY OF STUFF AND RUN MOST NEW GAMES WITHOUT NEEDING TO UPGRADE- The CPU is fast for single tasks, but can get a little overcharged under multitasks but nothing that it cant handle.- The fan is almost noisless, it is AMAZING compared to my previous i7 dell xps from 2011."," - Speakers are not the best nor the loudest, but they get the job done for most of the time- The CPU is only a dual core, my previous laptop had a 2nd gen i7 quad core and I have to say there is a huge difference in multitasking. But the speed for most tasks is amaziinnngg on the i5 its just that multitasking could have been better."," Now I bought this laptop to replace my 2011 Dell XPS 15 L502x, which had a 2nd Gen i7 and a Geforce 540M. I have to say I LOVE THIS ACER, I was looking to buy a new laptop and came accross this one, and its only for 500$. I gave it a shot and I have to say ITS FANTASTIC. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for the best laptop 500$ can get you. Now my budget was 900$ but I thought to myself why spend 900 on a laptop that will be outdated next year when 500$ can get me one that has almost same performance.Now to the interesting part which how well this thing runs games? - GTA V and  GTA ONLINE: High settings everything easily run around 20-30fps with average of 28 in 1080p- The Division by Tom Clancy's: you will not believe it but it runs on Medium settings everything at 900p, average fps 30 (VERY PLAYABLE AND REACTIVE)- CSGO: Max settings 1080p average 60-70fps- Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline: ULTRA Settings, 1080p average 40fps (Mind blowing)- Most new games can run on high settings on lower resolution.Seriously this laptop is waaaayy more than I expected and I can guarantee you WILL ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT TOO.Now one thing to consider is to get an SSD.What I did is buy an ssd and an HDD caddy , since this laptop doesnt have an optical drive, you can place a second HDD in the HDD caddy. So i took the HDD that came in it and placed it in the HDD caddy, and put the new ssd in it. Now the laptop starts in 13s flat all the time, and has a 1TB hdd as second drive that I use to store files and games.All reviews say the touchpad is not nice... IT IS VERY GOOD very sensitive, precise and reactive, IT CANT BE BETTER. It has multiple gestures and has a lot of cool features that can make using Windows very nice.

Many at 1080p depending on how old they are.," Requires some modifications to get the most of out this machine, but nothing so strenuous as to affect my rating. See below for what I did to make this laptop a 5/5."," This laptop is fantastic value for it's price point, but it requires a few modifications to be a 5/5:1. Swap out the HDD for an SSD as the boot drive. Night and day difference in read/write speeds and boot time. I would recommend picking up a Samsung since they are fantastically reliable. I used the 120GB variety which I picked up on sale on a South American jungle themed website for 55 bucks. This does require you to open up the back of the laptop, as does step two, but there are several fantastic tutorials on YouTube on how to do so safely. They use standard screws, so it's not a difficult procedure. 2. Buy a hard drive caddy to mount the HDD that comes with this laptop into the optical bay slot. These cost like 10 bucks, and allow you to make use of the 1TB drive as storage. Well worth the price.3. Use the Windows 10 media creation tool to do a clean install of Windows 10. This laptop comes with a lot of bloatware, and getting a clean install will make a huge difference. If you swap in an SSD as the boot drive, you will have to do this anyway.4. The speakers are a bit quiet, but if you enable loudness equalization in the device properties, you can get a little more umph out of them, just be careful to not blow them out.I spent a total of $555 on this laptop: $490 for the laptop itself, $55 for the SSD, and $10 for the HDD caddy. I haven't a single complaint and can run pretty much any game I play on here with at least 60FPS if I bump the resolution down to 720p. Many older games, especially Source games, run at a buttery 60FPS at 1080p. Hope this review helps you. Even with the extra stuff I listed above, I don't think there is a better laptop for this price point on the market right now.",12,13

Best value I could find with these kind of specs. The look and feel is nice. I bought my wife an even cheaper sub $300 Acer Aspire a year ago and I'm pleasantly surprised by the look and feel. My wife's Aspire is really bad though., The screen is passable but I am adjusting the angle a lot when I'm sitting right in front of it. If that really bothers you skip this. Hard drive is slow.," You can't adjust the solar for the 940m. You can adjust the color with the Intel HD display but that doesn't carry over to 3D. (or at least I don't think it does). Turning up the saturation improves the desktop view and for watching video but the display looks blah wh playing games. This appears to be a limitation of the 940m. I have a beast of a desktop gaming system so I didn't buy this to do a lot of gaming on, I just wanted something where it would be possible. One point I'd make is that modern games still look really good even when you turn down the settings to low. Arkham Knight still looks good on low settings and is fun to play on this laptop. I use Arkham Knight as an example because people are still complaining about how bad it runs on PC and the fact that it's runs ok on this cheap laptop is cool.",None,None

If you are aware and ok with the short comings listed above you should be fine with this laptop.I bought this for my 14yo son who likes to play games.  He currently plays Minecraft and an online CS GO, which he is happy to report he gets better frame rates than my 2yo desktop running an older i7 with a dedicated graphics card.I did do a few simple things before he even touched it though after reading many of the reviews here.  I swapped out the HDD for an SSD (Samsung 850 evo 500 GB) and did a clean install of windows.  This means none of the pre-installed Acer software is there. (Good thing for me)  I only booted once prior to doing this so really can't compare before and after, but this thing will restarts now in less than 10 seconds to windows login screen.  It seems very fast to me.I also plan to put the removed HDD into the open optical bay spot using a caddy built for this purpose.  I have the parts ordered for this and will follow-up when I get it installed and probably post a YouTube video also.  See update below.Again, to change the HDD or add memory or change the battery when it goes south, you have to open the case up as they are all internal.  This is not overly difficult (18 screws), but it could be easier if the battery was external and there was a port for the HDD and or the memory, but I guess this keeps the price down on this particular laptop.Again overall I am very happy as my 14 yo was blown away at the performance of his budget laptop!  I got the laptop pre-black-Friday for $429 here and the SSD from Micro center for black Friday $129.  So that puts the laptop at $558.  Retail now is $499 and $162 at the time of this review.Update:I got the parts and got the original HDD installed into the optical bay.  Worked like a charm.  So, I ordered the caddy from e bay (link below) and I also ordered a new mounting bracket and faceplate.  It turns out I didn't need the last two things as the optical drive insert already had these parts, and I just needed to transfer them from the insert to the caddy.  The one I ordered was cooler as it had a flash light for HDD activity, so I did use that as I had it.So the quick instructions are as follows:  Turn computer off.  Remove screw holding in the optical drive spacer (see you tube).  Install HDD into the caddy.  Carefully remove the faceplate and mounting bracket on the back that the screw was in and transfer both parts to the caddy.  Insert into the bay and reinstall the screw that was removed and power on.  Mine was instantly recognized and now we have 1.5 TB of storage. (500 GB SSD installed and 1TB HDD in the optical slot.  Wow that was easy.Link to caddy (remove the space between ""e bay” in the url):  http://www.e bay.com/itm/251530782171?_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT",13,13

9SIA9B53P02722,34-315-131,1/15/2016 11:31:34 PM,Anonymous,More than a fair price,5, Skip, Skip," This is a nice little laptop to get. I purchased mine for $485.00 for gaming and video editing. Note: If you purchased this and are expecting it, do the following.1. Right click on your desktop > Click on Display Settings > Move the aspect slider all the way to the left so that it is 100%. This will remove all ""fuzzy"" or ""blurry"" textures and texts you may see.2. Download CCleaner and uninstall any junk that Acer pre-installed. If you don't follow step 1 some of the text in the cc cleaner will be blurry.3. Change your default webpage magnification from 100% to 125%. I previously had a 1360x768 resolution laptop. When I went to websites I normally visit with this 1920x1080 resolution screen I found that almost all of them had white space on either side of the main content that was completely wasted. If you bump the magnification to 125% the page's content will fill your screen and make things easier to read and click on.Ok, now onto the review.Photo Editing Section:I shoot macro photography using a Nikon D3300 DSLR camera in a RAW/JPEG format. My file sizes per photo are usually between 5MB and 17MB per photo.I use Lightroom as my default photo editor. I find it loads up within a few seconds and I have no issues editing and exporting files. It's fine.Photoshop loads a little more slowly. I only use it for focus stacking macro shots though. This takes a while depending on how much Photoshop has to adjust my images to get a seamless stack. You might be looking at anywhere from 20 seconds to over a minute to fully link stacked images. For me, this isn't a big deal.Video Editing Section:I use Blender as my video editing software. I don't really do a lot of video editing, but from my experiences I'm able to edit and export videos at a fair rate. If you're exporting HD videos expect to wait though, this Laptop is a sub 500 or 600 dollar item, depending on when you buy it. So it's not going to be able to punch out 10 minute long HD videos super fast.Gaming Section.Don't expect to play most games released recently with this, even at minimum settings. You can play a lot of free online games like LoL and Dota with this, although games like that are meant to appeal to a lot of people so of course they won't be too demanding on systems in the first place. However, you won't be able to run really new games like The Witcher 3, Fallout, or anything of that nature with this device.That doesn't mean that you can't play a lot of other games though Steam. Total War games work fine. Most of the games from 2014 work fine. You might have trouble with some games simply because they weren't made when Windows 10 existed. For example, you might have to tweak your computer a little to get something like Skyrim to work, but that's nothing a little time won't fix.Overall, if you're looking for a good all around computer this is it. I got mine for a little under 500 dollars, and I know that this was a very fair price.As for the 1 TB memory... You get about 930 gigs to work with. Now I purchased this for both gaming and photography, so I'm not completely sure about how I'm going to handle the storage yet... An SSD would obviously be better for gaming and booting up apps, but the massive amount of free space is great for storing photos, especially larger photos. For now, I'm going to stick with the default hard drive simply because I need a place to put all those photos. Yes, you can put an SSD into this and it will preform much better, but it is 100% not necessary.",7,8
9SIA9B53P02722,34-315-131,1/14/2016 9:22:24 PM,Patrick G.,Good laptop and specs for it's price.,4," - Good specs for the price- Very nice looking 1080p screen. Going from a lower resolution on my last laptop, the difference is quite easy to notice. Should probably be used for a solo viewing experience though since the viewing angles are not the best.- Everything runs smooth and quick so far.- Games have run great so far. I haven't tried out anything too demanding yet, but things like Cities: Skylines and Dota 2 run and look great.- Keyboard feels good and is nice to type on.- Lightweight for it's size. My previous laptop was 15.6"" as well, and this is probably half the weight of that."," - Trackpad is really bad. I saw a lot of complaints about this but I was still surprised by how much I don't like it. By far the worst trackpad I have ever used. It's really too bad too, because that's my only complaint and is the only thing keeping me from giving this a perfect score. I've been trying to use a usb mouse whenever possible, and will probably end up buying a bluetooth one since I think I will be using it a lot. It's really strange too considering how much I like the keyboard."," - I would definitely recommend this laptop. Specs are nice for someone who is looking to use it for web browsing and some gaming. Just know that the trackpad is pretty terrible and the use of a mouse will probably be needed most of the time.- As for the build quality, I didn't really want to put it into the pros or the cons section. It's perfectly fine, but it's nothing special. I don't think it feels as cheap as some people have said, it's about what I expected for this price range. It's definitely lightweight, which is a positive, and I think it will help will keeping it from breaking and bending. I also like the texture design of it, and it goes a long way to making it feel a lot better than it probably is. So yeah, overall it's nothing special, but for this price point I think it's a decent feeling build.",3,3
9SIA9B53P02722,34-315-131,1/14/2016 8:13:44 PM,Pike H.,Potential Performance Per Dollar Champ?,4," To start off, I'll describe my reasoning for looking into a budget laptop. Recently my 5 year old HP Pavilion dv6 finally kicked the bucket when its n640 Phenom II dual core fried itself. Since 5 years is quite a good service life, I decided to retire it and look into getting a new laptop. Since I have a fairly powerful desktop I built myself (features an i5-4690k and R9 390) for $850 back in November, I definitely was not looking for anything that would put more hurt on my wallet. I was just looking for a power efficient and portable laptop computer. As I travel a lot for work, having a laptop powerful enough to play games would just be a bonus. As a result, my budget was aimed towards sub $500 laptops.Price: As stated, I was looking for a very cheap laptop since if I needed performance I had my desktop. Still, a laptop with an i5, 8 GB of DDR3 RAM, 1 TB HDD, 1080p display, and discrete Nvidia GPU for $480 was a very tempting offer. Other laptops in the sub $500 range had specs no where close to this laptop. Other offerings would offer a mix of an i3 or AMD CPU, 4 GB of  RAM, 500 GB HDD, 720p display, and integrated graphics. Various computers would have an i5, or 8 GB of RAM, or a TB HDD, but never all options together. With the addition of a Nvidia 940m this laptop was a steal. You won't find a laptop with a GPU better than a 940m until you get above $700.Performance: The main selling point of this laptop for me was the Nvidia 940m GPU and the Intel i5-5200U CPU. The i5-5200U is a pretty good mobile CPU. It is reasonably fast and definitely a good choice for this price point. It is also has enough grunt to let the 940m reach its full potential. The 940m is a mid-range mobile graphics card that should play most modern games at medium or higher settings. So far I have tested it with a few games to see just how capable this card is. The results were a pleasant surprise. To start I chose an easy game to run, Mount and Blade: Warband (2010). This was something my old laptop could even run well. This laptop ran the game flawlessly on the highest settings at 60+ fps. Now time for something more difficult. Skyrim (2011) was able to run on high settings, 1080p, at 30+ fps. Even better was Call of Juarez: Gunslinger (2013). This ran at highest settings, 1080p, at over 45 fps. Finally, the big question was if it could run Fallout 4 (2015)? At low settings, plus FXAA (low), and a resolution of 1280x720, the game ran at a consistent 40-50 fps. To conclude, this laptop should be able to handle most modern games and provide playable frame rates if you don't mind turning down the settings on more demanding games. Screen: On a lot of the more negative reviews the screen is quite heavily criticized, but I beg to differ. The screen I have looks gorgeous. The picture is sharp (1920x1080 resolution) and the colors are vivid. I was blown away at how good it was after reading some of those reviews. Sure it is a TN display and not an IPS, but the view angles are about 90 degrees (45 degrees from the center). That is plenty for a laptop screen since most of the time you'll be sitting directly in front of it. The screen also has no touch functionality, but I'd rather save the money than have the gimmick.Power consumption: This laptop only uses about 7 watts of power when idling, 12 watts at normal use, and only 45 watts at max load. For comparison, my desktop uses about 45 watts at idle, 100 watts under normal use, and over 200 watts while gaming. My old laptop used about 20 watts at idle."," To be honest, most of the cons I have for this laptop can be summed up as minor annoyances or nitpicks. This is a sub $600 laptop, so one should expect budget quality.Bloatware: Based on the reviews I was expecting BLOATMAGEDON, but it only turned out to be a mild nuisance. This laptop's bloatware consisted of about a dozen Acer apps, some third party apps, and then all the apps Microsoft forces down your throat even with a clean install of Windows 10. I opted to just uninstall the apps I did not want, a processes that took less than an hour. Some apps like Amazononeclick were difficult to uninstall, but after installing CCleaner I was able to rid the computer of all the undesired apps. After the cleanup, it boots up in about a minute and a half, something you won't really improve without installing a faster rpm hard drive or SSD. If you want to save a few more seconds on boot up though, you can always go the distance and clean install Windows 10.Hard drive: The hard drive this laptop comes with is a Western Digital Blue 5200 rpm mechanical hard drive. It is a pretty slow HDD and can easily get bogged down during boot up or transferring files. Having 1 TB of storage somewhat makes up for the lack of speed. Still most laptops in this price point have either a 5200 rpm mechanical HDD or a low capacity SSD. A bigger con though is that you need to remove the entire back plate to get to the hard drive instead of having a service hatch.Speakers: Even for a laptop, the audio quality is pretty sub par. The speakers have great amplitude, but the sound quality is poor. This is easily remedied by using headphones though.Casing: The casing is plastic and while it makes it light, the material feels flimsy. It should be fine if you are not rough with it though (you are not supposed to be rough with a laptop in the first place). Also the fit and finish is a little substandard as some of the edges are a little sharp or protrude further than they should. Anyway, think of it as a Toyota's interior; cheap, sparse, low quality, but it gets the job done.Optical Drive: I knew this laptop did not come with a disk drive, but I do miss the convince of having one. There are plenty of work around methods such as downloading the software off the internet or using a usb, but it is a $15 part that Acer should of provided."," For the price of $480, this laptop seems to be a good bargain, especially since its msrp is $600. If it lasts 4-5 years like my previous laptops I feel this might even be a great buy. If you can get this laptop on sale it is definitely worth a look. In short, this laptop is a good choice for someone who wants a cheap laptop that can do some light gaming and doesn't need all the bells and whistles. If you need more performance expect to pay a lot more or get a desktop. You can build a pretty high end desktop for $500.Some things I had a neutral opinion on:Keyboard: The keyboard is about average for what you expect on a budget laptop. One bonus though is that it is a full keyboard with a number pad.Mouse: A lot of reviews blasted this mouse for being unusable. I thought this at first, but after using it for a week, I've gotten used to it. The pad initially seemed to have a bit more friction than I was used to resulting in it feeling sticky when sliding my finger across it. That issue has gotten better with use. The mouse buttons on the other hand offer a satisfying click when pressed and in my opinion make up for the pad.Service hatch: The service hatch on this laptop is the entire back plate making access to the hard drive and ram more difficult that on other laptops. It does, however, provide you easy access to the heat sink and fan if you are one so inclined to perform routine maintenance on those very important components.",7,7

I personally like it a lot.," Normally I'd say any laptop with a dedicated GPU is out of the equation at this particular price range, but if you happen to catch a good deal on this, you're in luck. Overall, it's a pretty quick machine...not totally sure about the criticisms on bloatware, but there are definitely steps you can take to remove the excess off your machine. Some also claimed the upgrade to Windows 10 removed bloatware, but mine had Windows 10 out of the box, so that would perhaps explain why I didn't notice a large amount of junk on the machine.The keyboard feels pretty responsive. The buttons aren't raised super high or anything, but typing quickly was very easy after just a few minutes playing around. Only thing I really didn't like is honestly the placement of the power button, since it's grouped in right next to the numeric keypad. This laptop is perfect for a little bit of gaming...you wont be playing many games (if at all) that are very new, but you can definitely have fun playing a lot of classic games through Steam. Obviously you should compare specs with the kinds of games you'd want to play, but these were sufficient for me. For the sake of perspective, I am currently playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution at full speed, 1080p on default settings. Not a super old game, but definitely something that's not quite new either...hopefully that gives a little idea of what kind of games would run on here. By the way, I'd probably say that the touchpad is perfectly fine, honestly. It's got all the basic functions, full touch capabilities, etc. I'm certainly not impressed by it when comparing to more expensive laptops, but I'd personally say that you shouldn't let that be a deal breaker for you, when choosing this computer. This is a really fine machine.",None,None

But, if you are looking to expand on this laptop by adding a solid state drive or an optical drive then this machine, although expandable, is the wrong choice.So, lets cover the bad starting with the bloat-ware. This thing is loaded with bloat-ware, so I would suggest that you go to Microsoft and create a Windows10 install disk, completely wipe this machine, and do a clean install of Windows 10. This is the only way that you will get all of the bloat-ware out of this system.Expandability is also lacking; not because there isn't an additional drive bay available, but because of some backwards policy on ACER's part. After I had purchased this machine my wife decided that she wanted to download all of her CD music into Itunes. Since it had a drive bay open I opted to add an optical drive. After searching in the forums I found the part numbers for the optical drive that would fit (9mm drive) and attempted to order the drive through ACER. What I found was ACER has a policy that they will not sell you any parts that did not come in the original machine. So, if it didn't ship with a drive they won't sell you one. This also goes for a disk caddy if you want to install another hard drive. On top of that, because these machines use a 9mm thick drive and not a 9.5mm or 12.7mm drive, it is almost imposssible to find a drive theat will fit it. If you take the part numbers from the forum and google them you can locate the optical drive but you will find that it comes out of Europe (England or Germany) and the cost for shipping is even more that the cost of the drive. This also means that you won't find a blu-ray drive that will fit it either.I spent 3 days trying to find a Blu-ray drive that would fit and finally gave up. Long story short, I should have bought a Dell or HP and avoided the hassle associated with ownership of this ACER. Now I will have to get an external drive to lug around with laptop thereby making the expansion slot absolutely useless.",None,None

The HD screen resolution with dedicated GPU were the main selling points for me, even though I do not play many games."," Not very Linux friendly, although it is possible to get most everything working under Ubuntu 15.10. I had to downgrade the BIOS to 1.31 (it shipped with 1.51) just to use the LiveCD/Installer. Once installed, the laptop refused to boot into GRUB. To resolve this, you have to authorize GRUB in the BIOS (due to UEFI and SecureBoot being enabled). Once I sorted all of that out, Ubuntu booted but without WiFi (common in many laptops). A solution does exist (www.askubuntu.com/questions/674662/acer-e5-573g-wi-fi-adapter-not-working), hopefully it will be included in subsequent versions of Ubuntu. The touchpad cannot be disabled via BIOS and, while it does work in Ubuntu, is a bit difficult to use.The laptop seems kind of cheaply built, but felt sturdy enough while typing. Some of the smaller keys (F1-F12) seem to get stuck easily. Neither of those are deal breakers for me."," I replaced the included hard drive with an SSD I had hanging around and it greatly sped up the laptop. In order to swap out any component, you need to remove the entire bottom plastic cover. Not a huge deal for me, but can be a real pain for some people.

Some of the other reviews said it feels cheap, and while I agree the materials are lighter weight than a $1500 Lenovo or MacBook, it's clearly well built and isn't going to fall apart.  I could not justify the extra $1000 for a slightly sturdier keyboard feel on a machine I don't use every day.  A note on the track pad - something that had me really nervous given some of the comments from others.  I honestly don't know what they are talking about.  The track pad isn't any different than what I've used on other machines.  It's made by Synaptics which is the same company that makes them for most of the competitors.  I think it's totally fine and normal.  I did notice when I was doing the OS refresh that on the Acer driver site, they have drivers for other brand track pads listed for this model.  It's possible those aren't as good and maybe I was lucky to get one with the Synaptics pad.  Any time I get a new PC, I prefer to install the OS myself and get rid of all the extra junk that seems to always get loaded on from the factory.  This is really easy to do with Windows 10.  Just download the media creation tool from Microsoft and have it create a bootable Windows 10 install on a USB stick.  Plug that in, press F12 when you're on the very first Acer boot screen, and select the USB stick as the boot device.  Then you just follow the prompts to install and replace the factory Windows install.  The installer will find the product key and activation information on the machine automatically.  When it's done, the factory install will be moved to a Windows.old folder which you can delete.  I made a backup image of the hard drive before I did this because I wasn't sure how it was going to go and I didn't want to brick the machine and lose my Windows license.  Turns out that wasn't necessary, but I still recommend it as a precaution.  Final thoughts:  Although I haven't had it long, my initial feeling is that this is a fantastic machine.  There is a little bit you're trading for the price but it's not performance.  If you don't need interchangeable batteries or a docking station (no port for this) or an optical drive, then this is your PC.  I haven't seen anything that comes close to this level of hardware at this price point.I may upgrade the HD to an SSD at some point but that would just be icing on the cake.

9SIA9B53P02722,34-315-131,12/19/2015 4:45:46 PM,Joseph M.,A fantastic deal and a great laptop (after a little bit of work).,5," - Huge value for the price – especially with a little bit of work. Not a bad price even at the $600 retail price which I've seen only briefly. It's usually below $500. I got it for $425 the week of Black Friday.- I've had excellent battery life, personally. I made sure to charge the battery fully before first use and have consistently had 5+ hours of battery per charge. I haven't played a game long enough to test the battery under more prolonged stress, but surfing/downloading and general use has been yielding me more-than-adequate results. It is internal, but if you installed a SSD internally, it's relatively the same process. - The screen is fine, especially for the price point. Like others have said, the blurriness is a DPI scaling issue with Windows 10. Easily remedied and will probably be fixed before too long. 1080p and 802.11ac wireless on sub $500 laptop?! Count yourself lucky, in my opinion, even without stellar viewing angles.- Rocket League, MGS V, and Fallout 4 were all able to be booted up and were totally playable for the short time I played them. I wasn't getting a laptop for gaming, but it's a nice bonus being able to do so in many cases – even if the graphics are relegated to the lower ends of settings. A 940M is going to be better than pretty much any on-chip graphics."," - The touchpad isn't THAT bad. It does take some getting used to especially if you're not used to a multi-touch pad (though it's always possible that there are some touchpads that could be defective). When you just tap it (not click), you can feel and hear the top layer reverberate (because most of the pad can click) which I guess is a bit off-putting to many; it doesn't shake or move when I rotate or jostle the laptop around. Out of all of the things to be less-than-stellar, I'd prefer it to be the mouse as it is the easiest to work around; just snag any ol' USB mouse (or a bluetooth mouse to keep the port free).- The speakers are a bit weird. They seem to be a mix of a standard speaker and a vibration speaker; they're basically speakers on the bottom of the unit that are meant to bounce sound off of a surface. I've had moments of bad/quiet sound but then surprisingly good sound in other moments. The free version of ""DFX Audio Enhancer"" will suit most people fine when the max volume isn't enough and you don't have powered, external speakers.- The unit doesn't boot with the Numlock on and doesn't have an option in the BIOS to change it. Upon boot, Numlock does, however, bring up the login screen. I've just gotten into the habit of pressing it on then entering a PIN to login. Not the worst thing in the world. There are some tricks and simple registry hacks to have it on by default, but I didn't really mess with it since I need to press a key before the PIN anyways."," - Like many others have already said, definitely reinstall Windows on a SSD and move the included drive to a 9.5mm optical drive caddy. Don't even bother uninstalling stuff and definitely don't migrate – it's a waste of time. Just boot it up to get Windows registered to you on that unique hardware ID, grab the drivers, grab the tool from MS to make a bootable USB-drive installer, make it (~4GB), and go. There are videos online showing RAM and SSD installation for a laptop in the 573G series if you're cautious and/or nervous. It is more than worth the few hours and the extra $100 (or less) for the SSD and caddy combo. The only problem was that (at the moment, at least) the Acer website has the combined drivers for the whole 573G series which have some minor variations in hardware – not a huge issue but I had to waste time sorting though what should be narrow-able by the 52G3 subset. - The optical drive placeholder bezel detached pretty easily and was able to be clipped onto the caddy without the need for any adhesive. I did have to loosen the transferred drive/caddy screw mount a bit to be able to get the screw in underneath, but I blame the caddy so your results may vary. It's pretty snug even without the screw, though.- If you think you'll need more than 8GB of RAM now or in the next couple of years – which you may very well not – you might as well grab that right away since you'll have the unit open anyway. I grabbed Kingston HX316LS9IBK2/16. I couldn't find out exactly what RAM come stock inside, and I didn't want to risk any potential instability. I found that, in my unit, there was an 8GB stick of Samsung M471B1G73EB0-YK0.- The laptop itself doesn't feel like it's made out of premium materials, but it doesn't feel any more cheaply constructed than any other laptop by any other manufacturer in its price range. It seems at least as good as my last laptop which was twice the price. The 15-16"" Case Logic laptop sleeve fits it snugly.- The webcam works. It's not great, but it's better than nothing, I suppose. Works well enough in low light.- I haven't had any sleep issues like others have mentioned. That sounds like a defective unit to me.On sale and after upgrades, it's a dual core i5 5200U @ 2.2GHz, 16GB CL9 DDR3L, 2GB NVIDIA 940M, 240GB SSD, 1TB 5400RPM HDD, 1080p, 802.11ac, 2xUSB3, 1xUSB2, HDMI, VGA, headphones/set combo port, bluetooth, SD, and a case/sleeve for about $600. I could probably knock off another $30 at least if I sell the original RAM. I have absolutely no regrets with this purchase. What else do I have to say? Buy this laptop.",8,8

I swapped the HDD for an SSD (OCZ ARC 100) and loaded a clean copy of Win10 and this thing has run beautifully since. The 1080 screen is great and with an SSD the machine boots in under 10 seconds. Keyboard feels very solid.," None.A lot of other reviews complain about things that they knew before they bought the laptop. It's not fair to knock the machine for not having a backlit keyboard, optical drive, or SSD. If those things are important to you then buy a machine that has them or be prepared to upgrade this one."," Other reviews have mentioned blurry fonts. This isn't an issue with this computer, it's an issue with Windows 10 and 1080 displays. A quick Google search will point you to the text zoom option under ""display settings."" This is set to 125% by default on 1080 displays and is the culprit when it comes to blurry fonts. There's a simple registry hack that will fix the issue (again, just take a few minutes to google the issue).The touchpad is actually very nice. I was worried because of all the other bad reviews but most of them mention that they're mouse users. I've used a touchpad for years and this one took me a day or so to adjust to. It's a little different not having separate buttons to click, but after a few hours it becomes intuitive.There are a lot of screws to take off to replace the HDD or RAM but if you're the type of person that likes to do this kind of thing, you really should own a tiny powered screwdriver (check out the General Tools Power Precision Screwdriver). If you don't have one, here's your excuse to buy a new tool.The power button is a normal key, not a true button. This worries other reviewers but since I've never had any laptop key fail on me in the 10 years I've had laptops, I don't see the issue.",2,2
9SIA9B53P02722,34-315-131,12/12/2015 8:22:16 AM,Anonymous,,5," Great speed, video graphics, wifi speeds", The mouse pad," I love this new laptop. I've had it for over a month now and everything seems to be great. The wifi speed is amazing and the overall speed in general is pretty great. For the price I don't think I could find a better laptop. I like acer also because they're one of the few companies that allow you to do upgrades that won't interfer with the bios. So I can upgrade certain parts later down the road when they get outdated instead of buying a whole new laptop like I had to do with my hp.She isn't perfect though. Like so many of the complaints in other reviews the mouse pad is horrible but tolerable. It's super sensitive and thinks I left click all the time when my hand is hovering over it. With it being one single pad like the apple products the two finger movements just aren't that good. I try scrolling up or down a page and at times it thinks I'm zooming in or out or vice versa. For that reason I just use a USB mouse. I heard other people complain about the keyboard and materials in general being cheap and easily break but I haven't had an issue with either and feel like they hold up pretty good. Only thing I don't like is the number lock always resets to being off and I use the number pad a lot so that part is annoying. Although I'm sure there is a way to keep it on I just haven't tried to figure it outWith that being said I would still buy this laptop again. Don't let the mouse pad problems discourage you as it still works just not perfect. The laptop itself is more then worth it with the great processor, video graphics, wifi card",None,None
9SIA9B53P02722,34-315-131,12/8/2015 1:12:33 PM,LISA P.,Great Value,5," 5 STARS for overall Value!! There are a lots of reasons to buy this laptop, starting with it's high value-per-price. This laptop have great specs and is easily upgradeable -with one free RAM slot, and an open drive bay (empty DVD bay) to add another hard drive or DVD player.  The screen is bit washed out compared to more expensive laptops, but overall the colors are pretty accurate, and the contrast is good. The i5 processor is fast, and with my upgrade to an  SSD drive, the whole computer feels zippy and quite responsive. The best part, however, and the reason I bought it, is how well the GT940m handles games -modern games! True, on demanding games you have to turn down the graphics quality settings to medium, and lower the resolution, but it can handle a lot of other games on High at 1920x1080. The 940m is a great budget graphics card, and makes this laptop totally worth the price. Buy it while you can....that's a strong recommendation."," There are a couple (apparently common) issues with this laptop. The first is somewhat annoying -in that it goes into sleep mode whenever you move the laptop while its on. Yeah, that's right.... every time I move the laptop while its on, it goes into sleep mode. It wakes up again easily, but really...come on. The second annoyance is the mouse pad is touchy, and can trigger launching things, or zooming in or out without warning. To correct this problem, I went into the touchpad settings, and disabled the ""advanced features"". Other than those two items, not much else to complain about. I can live with these problems, easily."," So in closing, I can highly recommend this laptop, without hesitation. You will NOT find a better functioning, gaming, and productive  laptop for the price...anywhere...Period. So, I say buy it now before they're all gone, or the price goes through the roof once they find out they have a gem.",None,None

Relatively lightweight7. Does not overheat at all when running processor heavy applications or programs 8. Last, and the most important, is the price that this baby comes at. For most laptops with these specs, the prices can range from $600 to $800. I got it on cyber Monday for a measly $429."," 1. Terrible trackpad, doesn't bother me because I use a Logitech wireless mouse. The trackpad is a very odd type of plastic that doesn't let your fingers glide on it like most other comtemporaries.2. The screen is just meh, not awful but definitely not good3. The speakers are pretty below average even for a  laptop this cheap4. The thing comes packed, and I mean PACKED, with bloatware.

Non removable battery7. No optical drive"," Although the laptop has as many cons as its pros, I do not regret my purchase whatsoever. You have to trade your pros for cons because at this price level, you can't have the best of both worlds.

9SIA9B53P02722,34-315-131,12/5/2015 12:50:39 PM,Chad P.,Great laptop for the price,4," - Powerful for the price (grabbed it for $405 with VISA checkout)- Room to expand with an SSD- Surprisingly good screen. There are better, but I was expecting worse at this price range."," - Build quality obviously suffers a bit considering the components you're getting at this price. It's all plastic, but it does feel sturdy enough.- As others have said, the touchpad is pretty terrible, but it does get the job done if you need to use it.- Battery life is poor."," I'm very happy with my purchase. Considering the price (at least what I got it for at $405) this is a steal. I knew going in the build itself would be compromised considering the components it comes with, however it still isn't too bad.I definitely recommend picking up an SSD, the HDD itself is very slow at 5400 RPM. I personally installed a fresh copy of windows 10 on an SSD and the computer is very snappy now. Installing the SSD was sort of a pain, but if you know what you're doing it's easy. You'll need to move the SSD to the HDD slot to be the boot drive. You'll also have to remove the HDD completely to install Windows onto the SSD for some reason. Grab yourself an adapter for the HDD so it can use the drive bay and you have a great ssd+hdd combo for cheap.",1,1
9SIA9B53P02722,34-315-131,12/5/2015 11:04:23 AM,David C.,Good value laptop,5," Considering the price, you get a lot of hardware but there are a few caveats. Good decently fast processor that has a passmark rating of 3543. The GPU is just okay, but better than integrated graphics. The screen is 1080p and is good when viewing head-on. The keyboard is surprisingly good and bouncy, not squishy and unresponsive, The hard drive is a 5400 rpm WD Blue. The DRAM is a single piece 8GB so no dual channel (but there are two slots if you want to add another 8GB). There is an internal slot for a DVD where you can add a 9mm caddy for another 2.5 inch hard drive or ssd. For the money, this is laptop is a very good deal, just have to do a little work to make it so."," This laptop comes with a lot of bloatware from Acer. The bloat combined with the slow 5400 rpm hard drive led to a pretty slow boot time and a feeling of unresponsiveness when I first booted the laptop. However, this is what I did on the recommendation of a few other reviews. I ordered a 9.5mm DVD slot to 2.5 inch hard drive caddy for about 10 bucks. I took an old SSD from the laptop I was replacing with this unit. I made a Windows 10 install thumb drive. Windows 10 Home 64 bit. You don't need to copy down any serial numbers as the install process verifies off the internal hardware of the laptop. I downloaded all the drivers from the Acer website.Taking the back cover off was a semi-adventure. There were 18 screws to take off, then another 3 small flat screws to take off after the DVD drive cover comes off. Total was 21 screws. Take it slow. Start on the side of VGA and USB3 connectors and work around the back towards the power connector. Remove the DVD slot cover and then remove the 3 flat screws. Then be mindful of the tiny wire connecting the speakers, you need to remove the connector. Replacing the HD with a SSD was easy, as was installing the 1TB HD in the DVD slot with a (not provided) caddy.The software install took about as long as taking the laptop apart. Really not too bad. Most of the drivers auto-loaded with the Windows 10 install. Wifi, touchpad, Intel HD5500 graphics, sound all worked with no intervention. I went ahead and installed all the drivers from Acer anyways which took about an hour time. There are something like 10 different drivers to install and the list was kind of confusing on the Acer website. Be sure to install the Nvidia GPU drivers too. A couple of the Intel ones and the Atheros one had a repeat, meaning the driver is the same for two components. I then used File History in Windows 10 and created an image on the 1TB D: drive should I ever need to restore."," With a little bit of work and an old SSD, this laptop is very quick to boot and load programs. Windows 10 boots in 10 seconds. I tried World of Warcraft and it runs very smoothly on 1920x1080 and Good settings. I tried Ultra, but the fps was too low. Very happy with the price/performance of this laptop.The laptop case material has a very plastic-y feel to it. Doesn't attract fingerprints. The material in back of the LCD panel does hold fingerprints though. But think of it this way, this is akin to buying good (not great) parts for a desktop and putting it all in a $25 Rosewill ATX case. Yep, I've done it myself.",4,6

While not as great normally, if you manage(d) to pick this up during a sale, it's a steal -- getting a laptop with a 1080p screen and dedicated graphics at sub $500 is pretty rare."," The biggest con for me is this machine will not run Linux. Apparently there is a BIOS issue that just bricks it if it's running any distro and prevents new ones from being installed. Some users have had success by downgrading to a previous BIOS version, but due to the risk involved, and the fact their BIOS updater requires Windows, this is a major issue.More minor, 5400rpm HDDs in 2015 is pretty weak. If there are going to be any bottlenecks in work or gaming, it's going to be there."," This could have been an easy 5-star if not for a critical software and QA failure. Had I known ahead of time they had broken all existing and future Linux installs, and then went ahead and pre-loaded this broken BIOS on all new models, I'd have never made the purchase. Instead, this model will likely be getting returned as a result.",2,9

The keyboard is spacious and comes with a numpad. It's pretty tactile, however yes, it does not light up. Learn how to touch-type folks! My recommendation is to get 2.5"" caddy and one of those cheap $40 sandisk SSD's and load your OS on it. I would not bother cleaning out the junk, just download windows 10 using the microsoft tool and reinstall the whole thing. (If you are getting the SSD, make sure you format the HDD first then install OS on SSD)What can I say? Acer has a winner here.They hit the perfect price/specs/build quality ratio.

9SIA9B53P02722,34-315-131,12/1/2015 11:32:28 PM,Alec A.,Requires some work but can be great!,4," 1. Price  - Take the dedicated graphics card out and compare this laptop to other laptops with the same processor, amount of ram and a TB hdd and you will see that this laptop still beats their price.  - Most laptops around this price have either less ram, smaller hdd, or an i3 processor to compensate for touch screen capabilities. 2. Dedicated GPU  - For a budget laptop it comes with a dedicated graphics card. Definitely a big plus3. Keyboard  - I picked this laptop up for web development and back end coding on the go. This was my number 1 concern since I would be doing so much typing. The keyboard has a cool texture to it, feels a little rough. I was surprised with it because I expected something smooth and glossy.4. Body  - It has some sort of texture on the body of the laptop that surrounds it. At first I wasn't too fond of it but after comparing it to my girlfriends $1,400 laptop I realized I liked this one's body better. The texture of it leave zero smudges. Her's is smothered with finger smudges all over the place, while mine is nice and clean even while being a slob.5 .Network card  - Wifi is pretty much the same as LAN. I've had a lot of trouble with this on other machines.6. 1080p!!!!  - During Black Friday I was going nuts trying to find a good deal. I found so many too good to be true laptops just to find out that it wasn't 1080p."," 1, Bloatware  - This laptop comes with a TON of bloatware. This is not a problem if you plan on doing something about it. But for non tech savvy people this could end up frustrating you with slow boot up times and clutter everywhere.2. Screen  - The Screen has funky viewing angles. Also certain stuff looked blury but look down to see how to fix that. A lot of other reviewers think that is being caused from the screen but it isn't. The main reason I don't like the screen is because it is matte, I'd rather take a glare that I can direct than a big light spot if there is a light source behind you."," This is a great laptop for what it does. I was looking for a simple laptop that had at least 8gb's of memory and a TB hard drive. I did not expect to find one that included a graphics card, and an i5. ***** What to do when you buy to make it GREAT! *****// Get rid of bloatware for good! //1. Download PC Decrapifier, Remove everything that you don't need. Which is usually everything besides your sound, graphics and network drivers. This makes a huge difference.2. Once you remove everything unnecessary download CCLeaner. Click tools > uninstall, and go through and uninstall anything else not needed. then analyze and run CCleaner to remove all that junk. 3. Restart your computer and make sure it's running good. If it is go to the search bar on your start bar( bottom left ) and search ""restore"" and click the ""create a restore point"". Create a new restore point and name it  something along the lines of: ""No bloatware"". Now  if anything ever happens you can restore to a point where all that crapware is gone and you will never have to do this again.// Make screen look good( not blurry at all!) //1. Right click your screen and go to display settings.2. Click ""Advance display setting""3. Make sure it's set to 1920x1080p ( You paid for it, you should use it );4. It will prompt you to sign out to take effect. Do what it says.5. Once back go search ""Nvidia Control Panel"" in the start bar, and click the corresponding app.6. Now click ""Manage 3D Settings"". Under global settings you will see a ""Preffered graphics processor"". For some reason it is defaulted to the on board one INSTEAD of the nVidia! Click the dropdown arrow and set the""High-performance NVIDIA processor"". Apply/Save changes.7. Now on the left hand side of the nvidia control panel click ""Set PhysX Configuration. Once there click the dropdown arrow that says ""Select a PhysX processor"" and choose the GeForce 940M.If you followed the steps above then your screen and windows will no longer look blurry. Everything will be crisp and very easy to read. If by any chance the text is still blurry at all search in the startbar ""Adjust Clear type text"" and follow the instructions.Sorry for the long wall of text but this is actually a great laptop and I can even run fallout 4 on it at 1080p, but much better at lower resolutions. If you follow everything I wrote above you will have a great time and won't regret it. Also make sure you snag some protections like malwarebytes and be careful when installing anything not to add any toolbars or anything. Hope this review helped, never gave one before.",80,80
9SIA9B53P02722,34-315-131,12/1/2015 3:26:38 PM,Pakou C.,Best performance at this price,3," First off anyone interested in buying this laptop please take all of the other reviews with a grain of salt. Just about all the cons here are nit-picks and personal issues.1. Trackpad is bad? I agree, but it's not un-usable, it works just fine. It doesn't do anything funny and does what a trackpad does, it may not do it as nice or smooth but it works 100%. Texture on the trackpad feels nice too and clicks are tactile and give off good feedback.2. Keyboard doesn't have back light? Acert never said it did. Do people know what cons are for anymore? If you wanted back light you should have spent more money. Also the keyboard feels great to me. Typing on it is very very easy and shouldn't take you days to get used to it. I like it alot honestly and haven't found any issues with it. Travel is good, feedback is good and haven't found myself using the backspace a lot.3. HDD is Slow. Yes the 5400RPM WD Blue is rather slow.. Simply buy an SSD, clone the os and after 30-40 minutes of uninstalling bloatware you're good to go. If that's too hard then I don't know what to tell you.3.1 DVD drive cover is just plastic and there to fill the odd bay. However upon opening and to my surprise it does sport a ODD sata connector in this spot so it WILL SUPPORT A 2.5"" CADDY! I am running one now and have no issues what so ever! I am using my 250GB Samsung EVO as my OS game drive and the 1TB in the caddy as storage. This made it up for the lack of an m.2 slot.4. Bottom panel is removable by removing all the screws. Lift from the side opposite of power plug first and then crack the side with power plug open. Careful not to be rought because the speaker is mounted onto the back panel and then connected to the motherboard. If taking screws off and popping a panel off is considered hard to access hdd/ram, again I don't know what to tell you.4.1 Heatsink and fan are both easily accessed once panel is removed so maintenance on this laptop is good. I love accessable heatsinks and fans for easy cleaning and re-pasting. Throw on some better paste and you should be able to knock out a few more C in degrees.5. Bloatware? Acer is probably the worst when it comes to this. I don't mind it. Acer Care Center is a nice app and automatically searches for updates on your hardware, it does the job nicely so I don't mind it so much. Again it was 30-40 mins tops after I cloned the OS onto a Samsung evo 250GB SSD to remove the unwanted apps, after that it was all gravy.6. Though construction is mostly plastic everything is sturdy, including the LCD chassis/hinge as well. Little to no flex on keyboard, any keyboard on a laptop will flex depending on the amount of force you put on it. I pressed down firmly and moderately and little flex appeared."," I ran out of space in pros...7. Screen? Panel is a AU Optronics AUO38ED (TN PANEL! NOT IPS!). eDP 2 Lane so if you can find another fhd panel that has good sRGB you can easily swap it out. Colors aren't great but the laptop looks fine. I would give the screen a 7.8/10. Again, it's not as bad as others make it out to be. 8. Networking. It has a Qualcomm QCA9377 802.11AC wireless card that works beautifully. No issues with connection in my home and speeds are good too. 9. Speakers? Average. They are decently loud in a quiet place, throw out sound so not much to ask for. 10. Conclusion? I paid $429 as of 12/1/2015 and do not regret it what so ever. It did everything I WANTED TO DO WITH IT and what IT WAS MEANT FOR! Uhh why are you writing in caps? Well see it's because everyone wanted all the bells and whistles but only wanted to pay $400 for a laptop. Once they received it they cried about everything they knew didn't come with it. I just thought it was unfair and along with those unfair reviews scare off potential buyers. This laptop here is well worth $429. Try and find one with these specs at this price range, I dare you.", Want to have a laptop that can game on the go and won't break the bank? Buy this. As far as upgrade ability goes you have...2 x RAM Slots1 x Sata Slot1 x ODD / Sata slot that can utilize a caddy so that = another sata/2.5 slotWireless card is upgrade able as well but I see no need.,48,50

Granted, the bios doesn't let you do much, but you can disable secure boot and get into legacy mode over uefi if you so desire.

That's because when you buy this machine it isn't really yours. Windows doesn't give sufficient admin privileges and Acer doesn't allow you to access BIOS, at least not without mystical knowledge and a magic touch at just the right point.

I bought them for the hobby-startup my brother and I run. It took him <2 minutes on the machine before he was starting to talk about nuking it in favor of an all-Linux machine (no dual-boot), which should say something about the amount of adware on the machine. Unfortunately, it's effectively bootlocked. I like to run various sysadmin stuff in Linux shells, so this makes it much less useful to me.

It doesn't have a built in memory card reader.," I see other reviewers saying it runs Windows 7, that and the easy to buy DDR2 memory are worth noting.

It was in fact recalled and completely worthless.  It only lasted about 6min off of the charger.  I purchased a new battery pretty cheaply and it is good for about 3.5 hours of moderate to heavy use.  This is still an incredible deal on a laptop and just to state again, mine came with 2GB of RAM rather than the stated 1GB so even with the battery troubles I'm happy.", It was a very minor inconvenience to send back the battery for a warranty replacement.,,3,3

Only a couple of superficial scratches on top of case.", Battery is listed as recalled.

The docking station is an added bonus, too.These are bought for home-schooling and general use, everyday laptops around the home, and other T60's I've bought are used in business environments on the road everyday.  Windows 7 runs great and so does XP Pro ( I think Win7 runs better on this unit than XP Pro).  I plan to purchase a few more.", None.  Like anything in life if you look for negatives you will find them.  These units do not come complete with negatives - only positives.  They are strong and solid.  I have bought and sold dozens of these and they are all still going., I own & operate a computer repair center.  I've been in this business over 20 years.  Of all the laptops I've seen ThinkPads are the only laptops that I can say are strong and solid.  They may not be pretty but they are capable and dependable.  They just don't make them like this anymore.You need to install the operating system on some of these units.  Mine came with the disk and the key-code is on the bottom of the laptop.  If you want the operating system installed pay the higher price for a ThinkPad - otherwise keep your money and look somewhere else but don't complain about a great two hundred dollar laptop.,3,3

All laptops sold today are nothing more than portable DVD players with thier insane wide screen, this has old school 4:3 for fantastic vertical resolution for real work. First thing I did was swap low resolution LCD for 1600x1200 IPS LCD, no inverter needed straight swap.Next I swapped HDD for a SSD. making dick much faster.Finally I upgraded ram to 2GB for win7 install.Couldn't be happier after mods. I have a Quiet, good keyboard, high resolution, viewable from all angles IPS laptop for about $400.", Cons are it won't play games or 1080p video very well since it uses much older graphics chipset.,,3,3

Only one minor scratch on the bottom, otherwise looks like new. Battery works. After 2 recommended charge/recharge cycles, the computer reports about 2 hours, which is good for a battery that has probably been in storage for a few years.", Wasn't free.," Keep in mind that this is a business oriented machine. It is very good for browsing the Internet and handles MS Office great. I bought it primarily for Lenovo/Ibm legendary keyboard, which, by the way, is obviously superior to others--it is something that has to be felt to be appreciated. The other reason I bought this machine is because it has a full-sized screen. ""Widescreen"" means ""top of the screen cut off screen"", but this one hasn't been scalped. Dual core processor is nice. Most can be upgraded to a core 2 duo (needs mainboard v3 or greater and maybe a bios update) which brings the machine into the 64 bit realm. Core 2 duos can be expensive though. I've read reports of many running windows 7 without any problem.Oh, one other reason to buy is the overall build quality. This is a solid machine. Oh, and it runs very cool, and even though it is a bit heavy, it feels comfortable on the lap. I guess you can tell that I like this machine. Hopefully the 2nd unit will be as good as thi",3,3

Typical of what I would expect from a Thinkpad."," Unfortunately, I noted a flicker on the screen now and then. On one occasion, the screen just turned white. The battery was not discharged. I plugged in the computer to wall power, and then it came back on. Since it was well within the purchase date I contacted customer service. They told me that I could still buy the extended warranty, and then it would be transferred to a replacement machine. Unfortunately, when I tried to purchase the warranty within 30 days, the link for its purchase was already removed from my account. I then tried to work out something with NewEgg, but the return has become something of a hassle. While they extended the RMA period, and offered to provide a gift card, which was nice, I find that I didn't understand or remember that there was a much shorter deadline for a return shipping label. Because this whole process became so complicated, and my concern over how consistent the quality was on the recertified machines, I hesitated to buy another.", Buy the extended warranty right away.

I ran the bootable diagnostics that can be downloaded from Lenovo's web site, and the battery failed.  I removed the battery, and then it ran perfectly.  I contacted the vendor in charge of supporting the recertified Lenovo's, and they sent me a replacement battery (without requiring that I send the defective battery to them!), and that has worked fine.

Very few cons are not negated by price.Software: Comes with a copy of WinXP SP3 specifically for this PC, and it starts up with very little bloatware. Lenovo throws on a power manager and wireless service, but those work fairly decently. On the desktop lies an .msi to install the IBM Lotus Symphony office system, which is nice... since you choose to install it or not.Hardware: The laptop is speedy with it's 1GB (2x512MB) of RAM, and the entire package was nice and clean. All the parts worked out fine, including docking station and all the ports.The laptop itself: The T60 is a great notebook, so far as I've seen... it's got a clean look to it, and the keyboard is excellent. The LED night-light and the contours of the keyboard/workspace are well thought out. I love the mouse 'stick'/'nub' thing, much more than a Toshiba one I used to have. Decent battery life, around 4 hours. KEYBOARD DRA"," I received it with a slight cut on the lid, maybe 1cm long and fairly shallow. There was also a rather long cut 4.5"" long on the docking station, on the top.Software: That Windows install did not come with a backup CD, and I bet that refurb key on the back will not work with another OEM CD. I'll have to figure out how to get or burn one when I get my SSD... I want this one to be legit, and I don't know if I want to put 7 on it or not.Hardware: It is old. 1GB RAM, 60GB HD... but for the price, they're not really cons. Considering everything works, that's great. 1024x768 resolution is pretty bad, but manageable. Bit of a shock when you leave your 1920x1200 screen and start looking at this, though.The T60: It feels quite plasticy in places, particularly around the small touchpad. The RAM is also under the touchpad, and it's a bit odd to get to. Battery is a tad loose, and it's easier to unlock the battery release than it is to lock it. Only friction keeps the HD plugged in. Di"," Mouse nub sometimes gets in the way when I'm typing, but that may be because I type ""incorrectly""... I don't use the home keys. Overall this laptop is great. It's got it's faults, but considering the less-than-netbook price I was pleasantly surprised with my 'refurbished' gamble. (I usually shy away from refurbs)I've already put in an old set of 2x1GB sticks of RAM, and I'm going to shove a cheap 32GB SSD in there. It will be used as my 'go-to' laptop, so I don't have to worry about an expensive or work laptop when I'm derping about or traveling.The LCD is dim in comparison to my newer LCD monitors (Not LED, mind you). But you'll have to chalk that up to age. It's not bad, only apparent when you're working next to a new monitor.The 60GB hard drive is made by Hitachi, the RAM is by Hynix, the optical drive is a refurb Panasonic.",7,7

I'm not allowed to return it to Newegg because it's covered by Lenovo's warranty, despite the fact that it never worked upon receipt, so keep in mind that if you receive an unusable recertified unit, you're stuck with working out the resolution with Lenovo on your own."," Based on all the positive feedback, this looked like a solid buy, but it appears my unit is the exception.",1,2

Excellent condition.Solid machine, my company has been leasing various ThinkPad models for the last 3 years and they've been bullet proof.  Strong, durable, and I don't know of any failures.I was sad to see my work computer go.  The only thing mine needed (running XP and Office 2003 in an engineering environment) was a RAM upgrade.If you spend an extra $40 on RAM, you'll have a very formidable machine...unless you're planning on gaming (then I don't know).You can actually get to both of the RAM card slots relatively easily as opposed to the R52 models where you had one easy card and one not so easy card.Comes with a docking station (albeit a little bulkier than the R52 version)."," Here's the reason for the 4 instead of the 5, I was expecting it to come with a 1GB RAM card but instead they both came with 2 x 512MB RAM cards.  I was going to live with just having 3GB of RAM...but now I'm having to buy another card for each...a little annoying to have to spend the extra $45, but I understand why.This is a really minor one, the RAM is installed under the keyboard (so it's a 7-minute job instead of a 4 minute job to upgrade the RAM...and there's the risk of unplugging the touch pad in the process).  YouTube had a great video out there if you're a little nervous doing the upgrade yourself.  It's super easy.Screen resolution is a little limited, but more than adequate for most applications."," If you buy this laptop (and I'd do it again without hesitation) just plan on buying (2 x 2GB) DDR2 RAM cards at the same time.  It'll run XP and Office 2003...and just about anything else you want seamlessly.  Although this is not a Toughbook, this is a very solidly designed laptop that will provide years of durability under even some of the more extreme (read: kid) environments.  I think the nicest feature is that the hinge between monitor and keyboard is made out of steel and that's typically the weak link on laptops...I hope to not validate this, but I'm pretty sure it'd survive a fall off a coffee table or couch...as long as it didn't land on ceramic tile...",1,1

It also includes digital video connector, digital audio via SPDIF, a 4-port USB bus, separate power supply, 1Gb Ethernet port, keyboard and mouse ports, and a key lock. The T60 mounts directly on the doc, but NewEgg may be shipping a cheap generic doc from Targus instead, which has limited features. Also, the ThinkPad T60 (1952AP2) ships with 2Gb of RAM. Check with NewEgg to see if they have the proper model number for this machine."," 1st generation Core Duo chip -- Intel quickly replaced this early hybrid with the more efficient and cooler running Core 2 Duo. A better choice ThinkPad is the T400 (AP2), with a 2nd generation Core 2 Duo processor, larger hard drive, more RAM, and faster FSB clock."," I traveled with laptops for almost 20 years. I've used generics, Compaqs, Dells, Sony's, and TIs, and finally switched to IBM ThinkPads in the late 1990s. They have proven to be the most reliable laptop for the road warrior. They run forever.

I still use an old T30 to receive satellite radio, and my old T40 is also still running keeping books for a charity. My T60 is still fast and fully functional -- a perfect coffee house companion that doubles as a desktop when docked at home.  Yes, you can find many a cheaper laptop, but none will last as long as a ThinkPad. The refurbished prices here on NewEgg are 30% less than those found at the Lenovo/IBM site.

My own T60 which is now 5 years old, just keeps going and going and going. I've bought 3 other machines in the years since, but when I need a rugged old friend that gets the job done, I use my T60. I have the 14-inch, high-resolution screen. This is a 15-inch, low-resolution screen. That means it will be bigger and heavier than my old friend. Still, for people who want a bigger display (easy on the eyes) and who won't be on the road a lot, I think this $225 deal is a good one. I've thought more than once about selling my T60 for $100- $200, but I always change my mind because its got its uses as long as it keeps working. There was a reason why these machines had a 3-year factory warranty. They are that strong."," Large display size, but just the standard (lower) resolution1GB RAM, Windows XPAs equipped, this machine is a decent value for casual use (internet, email, word processing). But, as soon as you start adding money for RAM or a new hard drive the price will grow to the point that you can buy a new, better machine, even a ThinkPad (but not the ""T"" series)."," This machine can easily serve almost any computing need for the average (casual), non-road warrior user. I have a T60 (model 2623) that is almost the same as this one--same CPU, different screen and graphics. I am currently running Windows 7 just fine with 3GB of RAM. If you stick with XP, 1GB is sufficient I suppose, but this type of RAM is still fairly common and cheap. Do yourself and the machine a favor and put 2 1GB DIMMs in it.Windows 7 is fully supported on this machine, unlike many other newer models from other manufacturers (like Dell, Sony, HP) that have dropped support past the original OS. The T2400 Core Duo CPU (i.e., it is not a Core 2 Duo so it cannot run a 64-bit OS or use more than 3GB RAM) is quite speedy.

My kids use it for netflix and my wife for school and not a single complaint about it.",  The speakers are on the bottom which is weird but I was aware of this when purchased. The trackpad is also very touchy so I would suggest a mouse. I did have one hardware issue day one but I believe that it was user error (my wife) didn't connect the charger properly so she couldn't get it to turn on. Update on cons: The PC itself is a delicate build my daughter (3 years old barely 20lbs) fell on a pillow and it was underneath the  pillow it cracked the screen and stopped functioning. However newegg took care of the repair., Overall this computer is a steal it runs great and is very cheap I would highly recommend it to those looking to purchase a new laptop.,1,1

I used it for Adobe Applications like Indesign and Premiere, to 3ds max. This laptop plays mostly every new game if you lower the resolution to the right amount. As a pc gamer, tweaks are how you will play games like dark souls 3 (which i am playing with mostly every setting to high {no AA) on this great laptop). However, after i added an SSD by replacing the DVD optical drive that this laptop ""does not have"" (It's just a plastic object to fill in the space, you'll need to buy an optical drive with the hard drive adapter in it and just replace the lid of the drive with the one from the plastic object so it looks like nothing happened), the laptop became one fast machine. With a boot time of me sitting down on my chair and putting my phone on the desk, the windows 10 laptop has already booted up my desktop. If your a windows 7 user, it's probably going to be a little faster. Overall, if your looking for a killer, do it all laptop, this is it!

First thing I did was turn it on to see if it worked - booted up just fine, then turned it off. I took out the 16 or so screws from the base, and gently pried the bottom off using a soft plastic tool. As others have mentioned, there's no easy easy access to the memory, hd, or other parts. I swapped out the hard drive from a samsung evo 250gb, and added in another 8gb stick because why not - benefit really being dual sticks versus one, i don't necessarily need that amount of ram. So after a clean install of windows (I never experienced the bloatware people were talking about because I never poked around in the factory shipped drive), the laptop runs incredibly smooth. Boots up in about 5 seconds. Shuts down in about 5 as well. A month or so later I ended up buying another 250gb samsun evo and a tray for the vacant slot where the optical drive would've been. Moved any games, media, music, frivolous things over to there. The screen is quite nice for the price, it's matte so no shine from objects/lights behind you. The keyboard is decent, it's not backlit, there's been a few times where it would've been nice to have. Odd placement of the power button but not a con. Overall, after adding about $200 into it, it's what i'd expect, and i'm pleased with that."," It runs some demanding games at normal/medium settings, with some fine tweaks. For games i keep the resolution at 1600 x 900, or 900P. For Bioshock Infinite I can sustain ~42 fps at ""normal"" settings, with high detail on textures. Fallout 3 runs decent on it as well, again keeping things at the medium level of settings. I can't really call this a con... but perhaps i was expecting more out of the 940M 4GB card.I'll admit the trackpad is pretty bad, feels a bit stiff, and i've always liked having dedicated buttons versus the one big pad look. Expect to use a mouse with this at all times.Fans pretty much run all the time at low speed."," Overall, if you can get this for around $500 again, i'd go for it with the caveat you swap out the harddrive. Ram and second hard drive were unnecessary upgrades in my opinion but i did them anyway. The only thing, as the review title implies, is this being the first new laptop i've purchased in 10 years, i kind of wish i just went a little bigger and went for something with a GTX series graphics card... i don't game much at all, but it would've been a ""nice to have"" knowing i could just run games at max. Now had i just won that Powerball i'd have made an upgrade...",0,1

I can run some older games (haven't tried on anything newer) but the 3d seems decent enough. It's fairly fast overall.," The two biggest issues are: 1)The trackpad is garbage. Expect to use an external mouse for sure. 2)The wifi is garbage. I'm getting terrible download speeds over wifi on all networks I've used it on, and I'm not the only one. Several people have complained about it and Acer can't fix it. Expect to purchase a USB wifi adapter. 3)ACER BLOATWARE! Expect to spend some time uninstalling all the crapware that Acer bundles."," Overall I'm on the fence about recommending this. It's OK for the price, but buy something better if you can afford it.

Just upgrade it if you want. (not needed for me as it's for my kids first laptop)There seems to be an issue with Minecraft and a random white flash of the screen.

Happens with both laptops, so I'm guessing it's either a driver issue or something else, still trying to troubleshoot it, if anyone else is having this issue or has a fix, I'd like to know."," I would have to say the people complaining about the screen don't really know what they are talking about.  These screens are designed to remove a lot of the blue glare that you get that can cause people to have headaches, so yes it looks different then what you are use to, but overall it isn't a real problem.  Good for kids as they shouldn't be staring at a screen for hours on end as it can cause developmental issues in their eyes.Also, if you are going to play any games, make sure you go to your NVidia settings (right click on desktop) and make sure you designate which programs/games to use the Dedicated NVidia card. If you are having issues with minecraft modpacks not loading, make sure you designate your java to utilize the NVidia card, or it won't load the Physics properly, in some cases (FTB Infinity to be specific for me and my kids).Even though there are a few cons, they are mostly just pet peeves or some issues because I'm not accustomed to windows 10 yet.

(CS:GO, Rocket League, even the new Metal Gear)- Screen is fine, and I cannot complain about it. 1080p resolution.- Does NOT include a CD drive, but they did leave the mSATA connection for expansion on the right side. A great move which allowed me to use a SSD caddy to replace the less than perfect Hard Drive as the boot drive. I used an ORICO 2.5 inch SSD Caddy (9.5mm) to hold and convert an SSD's SATA connector to the mSATA provided. I was easily able to add an SSD for under $100.- My previous laptop could maybe last 45 minutes off of its charger, so this one blew me away. On high performance mode while playing games I can go for roughly 3 hours, and on Power Saver mode while browsing the internet you should easily be able to get 6 hours."," - The initial install of Windows 10 was SLOW and bloated. Wasn't a deal breaker for me initially as I planned to install Windows 7 immediately. (The following is not necessarily a con): However it will take extra effort if you plan on doing so. Acer only provides drivers for Win 10 and 8.1 so you will have to do some severe driver hunting for Windows 7.- Power on/off switch is a key on the keyboard. Terrible idea to put it on the numpad as well, as a small slip-up in number input can start the shutdown process.- The included hard drive is unfortunately a con. Although it's got great space at 1 TB, it only has a 5400 RPM rating. As I mentioned before you can add another SSD/HDD with a caddy pretty easily. If you are brave enough I have seen a YouTube video of someone replacing the included hard drive relatively easily.- Battery is not immediately accessible through the bottom of the laptop and would require you to open it up to reach. It would be virtually impossible to do a battery hot-swap if you're into that."," - Includes a numpad on the keyboard, which is a necessity for me, but as a result the keys and spacing are smaller.- Touchpad works fine, but I have mainly used a USB mouse. It's nice that they have included a function shortcut to easily disable/enable the touchpad.- The outer appearance looks great, but feels a bit flimsy. Nothing to worry about if you're careful with it though.I wholeheartedly suggest to add the SSD Caddy and an SSD to the machine. For what you're saving on this laptop it's definitely worth it and fixes the most glaring problem with this product (in my opinion). I used the ORICO 2.5 inch SSD Caddy (9.5mm version) and it fits perfectly into the empty bay, almost as if Acer designed it themselves.- I cannot definitively state that ALL Acer laptop chargers work with this laptop, but the charger from my 2009 Acer laptop works with this one, so if you lose the charger you can probably find a cheap replacement.In the end I am extremely satisfied with my purchase as it serves as a great travel, school, and gaming-on-the-go laptop.",1,1

Of course, it is not under warranty and they state it will cost $260 to fix, when I paid twice that for the laptop. I just called up a repair shop near my house and they said it should cost about $100 to fix.

I loaded a clean OEM version of Windows 10 and it runs great and is certainly fast enough.  I am extremely happy with this purchase.  I also added a DVD burner I had laying around.  I found a place that sells parts for laptops and they had the DVD drive bezel/drawer cover that matches the laptop.  I also bought an additional 8GB of memory to bring it up to 16GB.  I am not gamer but if I wanted to play games, I feel like I would be able to using medium settings.  Others have said it does a good job at it.  I personally like the anti-glare properties of the display, others may not.  Others have also said you can play with the colors if that is a problem.  I'm fine with the display personally.  For the price and upgradeability of this laptop, this is a great deal.  The fact that the DVD bay is active, open memory slot and the 1080 display, I give kudos to Acer for going the extra mile where it matters to me.  I do not care about backlit keyboards, I do not type in the dark.So if you are in the market for a laptop and mainly use office productivity applications for surf the web, this laptop is plenty and with the 1080p display, everything looks nice and sharp.Final note:  I never booted into the hard drive that it came with so I don't have personal experience with the bloatware and how slow this hard drive is.  I just know that bloatware does come on it and I know from personal experience that 5400rpm hard drives are slow by nature.  The hard drive is definitely the bottle neck on this laptop.  Get an SSD.  I did not have any problems opening the bottom cover, I just made sure I was careful and slowly popped each clip going around in a circle being mindful of the ports on each side.  (I've done this many times so I have experience, not for everyone)", The only thing that I can ding Acer on for t his laptop is the rattle like sound when typing on the keyboard.  It does give it that cheap feel but considering the price I can certainly live with it.  Some have complained about the touchpad.  It seems okay to me for the little I used it.  I always carry a wireless mouse with my laptops and always use them.  The touchpad for me is strictly for backup puropses., To make this a good laptop an SSD is essential.  Adding a DVD and more memory is more of a luxury and I already had the DVD and luckily the SSD.,1,1

(ahem SSD ahem)* Full HD", * Screen is not IPS but can't complain I bought it for $500!* A 5400 RPM HDD," This computer is pretty awesome if you have some tech knowledge. If you're one of the people who simply say “This doesn't work!” without identifying problem then avoid buying this.Alright so here's my guide to making this computer awesome after you buy it:Buy an SSD for this laptop its essential because otherwise you would feel this laptop is really slow because of the slow 5400 RPM HDD. No you don't need any technical skills for it. Search for a 9.5mm caddy on the internet, put the SSD inside the caddy, and place the caddy in the optical bay space. Take the cover off the empty optical bay and put it on caddy.NOTE: You do not need to install SSD by opening the laptop because the Optical Bay slot is just as fast with Sata 3.After that I would simply recommend to make a windows 10 flash disk. Download the tool from Microsoft. Boot the laptop using flash drive and format everything and then install windows in the SSD. That's it voila, you got rid of all the bloatware and have a fresh copy of windows on SSD.Now that solves the problem of what many in the reviews are saying ""This computer is slow"". The other problem is the screen. This is a TN screen, every TN screen that I've seen has bad viewing angles. PERIOD. Stop listening to other reviews it's as good as any TN screens. Comparing it to my IPS laptop, the TN does need some color adjustments. For that try playing around with color in Intel graphics properties.Final thoughts:This is pretty much the best deal I saw and I bought this just for programming classes. Comparing it to my $1,300 gaming laptop I think this is so worth it for school and casual gaming.",2,2

I've also had several female friends compliment the design as well. So, its not just for the guys!Under heavy haul the heat sink and fan, of the 940M GPU, do a great job of kicking out all of that exhaust, leaving the rest of the laptop feeling cool underneath.Even under heavy performance the battery lasts for more than 90 minutes.

Feels very unreliable, especially when holding it down to reboot. It does not have the ""clicky"" responsiveness like most computers do. If the key somehow breaks, I doubt you will be able to power on the laptop.  -Graphics on screen breaks into discolored lines once in a while-Horrendous screen for 2015, unacceptable quality.Acer should have put in a better screen. In fact, they should give everyone who bought this model a replacement. Takes time to get used to and you'll find yourself squinting. -Built in keys are very flimsy. Arrow keys seem to be the weakest point on the keyboard as my down key has already come off due to a bent hook that holds the key in place. Wear on the keys show up fairly quickly. Some keys are starting to feel loose and responsive.-Terrible mic. Speech pick-up on this mic fluctuates like crazy. Some moments people will be able to hear you, the next you start to cut out on the other end. Absolutely janky if you're trying to use it to communicate with teammates during games or anything else for that matter.-Speaker location is stupid. Whoever designed the laptop to have bottom-facing speakers is beyond me. -Touchpad is positioned a little more left than what I'd like it to be. May not be an issue for you.-No backlights for keyboard-If you want to replace anything on this laptop (including the battery), you will have to unscrew the entire back to get into the internals."," I decided to wait a couple months before writing a review for this laptop to benchmark it and give an accurate reading for whoever wants to purchase this laptop. For the price,  I think that Acer could have done a better job in investing a better chassis, keyboard, and monitor for the laptop. It barely passes as being usable and I'm quite sure the durability will not hold up. To sum it all up, you're getting a solid spec computer with the latest amenities (as of Quarter 4 of 2015) that runs games at low-medium in a slightly better than garbage plastic chassis and peripherals. A look at other laptops with the same specs is highly recommended for better build quality.",2,2

Plays League of Legends at a solid 90-120 FPS with mid to high settings at 1080p, and plays older to newer game just fine at 60 FPS when you set the resolution to 720p. It can handle 1080p on newer games just be prepared to take a hit to either FPS and your graphics settings, evaluate what you need.The sound on this thing is misleading, while the speakers on it are absolutely horrible, the soundcard itself that's inside of it is fantastic. I'd personally only have a pair of headphones or speakers plugged in if I were listening to media.The trackpad is inexcusably bad, I wish they had used standard buttons. Since I use a mouse however it doesn't bother me so much.The screen is a bit washed out but it doesn't bother me. For productivity and for gaming you begin to forget the issue. The viewing angles are sort of bad but at this price you have to expect that.The keyboard is wonderful to type on, end of story. The only complaint is the arrow keys but I don't use those so I can hardly complain.The processor in this thing is actually fantastic, I can stream most games at 720p with no issues, as well as lower demanding games like league at 1080p.

Sadly, it wasn't just one error either, multiple ones but it seems related to the Nvidia graphics card, and nothing I can do would fix it; updating all drivers not just graphics card, resetting windows, using a fan, etc. It is unfortunate because for the price it should be a decent laptop.

9SIA0AJ3NS9287,34-315-065,11/13/2015 7:36:48 AM,Ryan P.,Great laptop for a great price,4," Great laptop for the price. Because it comes with (1) 8GB stick already installed it wasn't hard to upgrade to 16GB (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231579). Has plenty of processing power, with the 16GB of RAM I'm able to run Server 2012 R2, Windows 7, Kali, and PFSense without the laptop being bogged down too horribly. I also recently flew from Seattle to Chicago (roughly 4-5 hour flight) and was able to watch movies the entire time and still had battery power when I got to my location."," Ton of bloatware. Took me about 45 minutes to remove all the bloatware initially. Also it does not come with Win 10 Pro or an SSD. Another thing, when upgrading the laptop the HDD and RAM are not easily accessible and require the bottom of the laptop to be separated from the top keyboard portion. This wasn't difficult but you have to go slowly and I'd recommend watching a youtube video of someone doing it before you attempt it."," The screen isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. I moved from a Dell Latitude 630 to this and the video quality is by far better.

9SIA0AJ3NS9287,34-315-065,11/8/2015 3:06:31 PM,John B.,Good Light 1080p Gaming PC,4," * I bought the Acer E5 for a client--who had a very limited budget--to play light video games on, primarily Indie Steam games and Minecraft. To this end, the Acer E5 excels. *- The price for this PC ($509) cannot be beaten if you're  looking for a light gaming laptop. There's a lack of selection available for laptops that have a discrete GPU and are budget-friendly. For example, jumping just to a 950M is an average increase of $400; hence, why I always recommend a Desktop for gaming, as price differential is astronomical, but some people need the mobility and that's understandable (I once owned an Alienware, but that's a purchase I still regret). However, the Acer E5 strikes a great balance for light gamers with light wallets. Its 940M provides enough horsepower for indie Steam games, Minecraft and most MOBAs to run smoothly, and on a striking 1080p screen. The fact that you can now purchase a laptop featuring a 1080 screen for this price is very satisfying. Movies look great also.- Speaking of the screen, it is pretty nice. It isn't an IPS or anything, but it's fine for straight on viewing, and its color production is more than adequate. The bezels aren't small, but overall, the E5's aesthetics are pleasing. Its top has a brushed aluminum look, while the inside panels are a smoky gray color with a beaded feel. Combined together, it doesn't clash but instead looks rather sleek.- There are no cardinal sins when it comes to the keyboard layout, yet I've never been a fan of the combined up and down arrow. It also features a numpad and the keys react responsively.- It has a well-rounded Intel i5 processor, which should be more than enough for the gaming you can expect at a 940M. Apps run quickly and boot is about as fast as it can be without an SSD. - Acer (or more like to Nvidia's and Intel's credit) has incorporated a smooth transition between the Integrated Intel HD 5500 and Discrete Nvidia 940M GPU. I didn't need to tweak any settings for the GPU to kick in when running games or to back off when browsing. Speaking of which, the GPU ran nice and cool under stress, maxing out at a luke-warm 69 degrees in Unigine. I'll provide a snippet of benchmark results in Other Thoughts."," - The viewing angles aren't too impressive. When moving a few degrees, color is nearly completely washed out. However, this is to be expected when purchasing any laptop in this budget range.- I do not like the power button being a key on the keyboard. It just feels like too much can go wrong positioned there.- This is a personal preference (even on my own Aspire S7), I do not like the flush, flat touchpad. I prefer dedicated left and right buttons, especially for a laptop like this that can arguably be meant for light gaming. Obviously, I recommend a gaming mouse though. Still...- There is a good amount of bloatware on here. Just take the time to uninstall the programs. Yeah, it's a pain, but nearly every manufacturer nowadays includes copious amounts of bloatware apps; it's a way for them to make more money, I suppose.- I don't know why Acer has been doing this lately, but the space for a DVD drive is present, but non-functional. I really don't understand it. If anything, use that space to put more IO, or to make the chassis a little thinner. It's confusing. - This may be an isolated event, but the right side USB port is extremely tight. When putting a USB connector in, you really have to wiggle it in. For some reason it's really tight and difficult, but the others are fine."," - Do not expect the E5 to run Major titles, besides maybe some less-demanding games at Very Low settings.Benchmarks - Unigine Heaven: Medium Quality _ Everything else disabled. FPS: 16.9 - Score 425 - Min/Max FPS: 7.7 / 32.7Low Quality _ Everything else disabled. FPS: 35 - Score: 580 - Min/Max FPS: 9.5 / 50.5* Overall, this PC is a great bang for your buck. You get a dedicated GPU, a well-rounded processor, plenty of storage, right amount of RAM, and a 1080p screen for about $500. *",3,3

See below.Would be nice to have one of the USB 3.0 ports on the right. At least the HDMI and VGA aren't right next to each other so you can use both."," To access the RAM/HD you'll need to flip the laptop upside down, remove all the screws. Take out the CD drive blank. There are 3 small screws underneath there. It's best to start in a corner and pop up one set of clips. Run a small metal tool in the gap and you'll pop up the clips around the laptop. Don't yank off the bottom cover as there is a cable connecting the motherboard to the speakers, which isn't a ribbon cable and is easily removed. From there, you have easy access. Yes, it could be easier, but it is really not that difficult. Install process for swapping the HD for an SSD was about 15 minutes, most of it removing the screws.As for comments on bloatware - it has some. With Windows 10, once the computer is activated, you don't need a product key.I've found it's easier to just format and reinstall Windows.

9SIA0AJ5BS4717,34-131-403,7/14/2014 1:47:13 PM,Sam C.,I love this thing,4," Light: I can carry this like it's an actual notebook. I can hold this BY THE SCREEN and not damage it. It is a huge improvement to my bulky 17"" laptop.Speed: The OS is based on the Chrome browser without much else installed. This means there is not much slowing it down. You can boot up, log in, and open the browser in well less than a minute.Battery: >7 hours battery of light web browsing. That is amazing.UI: The UI is very simple and intuitive. In fact, the whole thing is beautiful in its simplicity. If my technophobic grandma wants a laptop, this is what I am getting her.Google: Everything is done through Google services, rather than installed programs. Whether this is a pro or a con is up to you.Linux: Chrome OS is Linux based and there are ways to install Ubuntu along side it. If you're into that, like me, it is a good way to turn it into a general purpose computer."," Limited: You can install chrome extensions but not normal programs. If you need some special program installed and there is no Chrome extension or Google service, this would not suit you.Updates: System updates are automatic without any prompt or way to know they are happening. This has slowed my Internet connection. I have not found a way to disable this.Google: If you don't like Google's cloud services, this can get annoying.", I installed Ubuntu and now run Firefox on this. I'm such a rebel.,4,4
9SIA0AJ3NS9287,34-315-065,10/18/2015 10:43:50 AM,Dexter B.,Acer Laptop best performance for the dollar,4," Very good hardware for this price point.  The 940m dedicated graphics card was the primary reason for me getting this laptop.  1080p display is nice to have.  I5 cpu performs well.  This laptop has much better battery life than my old one, about 8-2 hours on full charge.  That is a large range, but that is because if you were playing heavy games the whole time you might only get two hours, whereas light web browsing you can get really good battery life.  On the balanced power setting, while doing light web browsing the fan doesn't even kick on, so this laptop doesn't pull much power and it runs cool."," My biggest complaint is the screen's color.  Compared to my desktop monitor this screen looks washed out and cannot show as many colors.  Without the side by side comparison however, you may not notice that much of a problem.  There has also been lots of complains about the bloatware installed.  I would agree, however I think this is pretty easily fixable."," People have made it clear that the track pad is cr*p.  I myself have never liked track pads but I think this is at minimum an avg. quality one.  It is pretty big which is nice, but I fell it is to far to the left.  The track pad is definitely usable, but like all laptops I would recommend a mouse.",1,2

The best way I found to install Windows was through a USB with the Windows Media Creation Tool. And during Windows setup, I selected the second option which creates a new copy of windows (therefore no McAfee and other apps). However I did have to reinstall the NVIDIA 940m driver which wasn't a problem. Overall, its a good gaming/work laptop. Installing any 3rd party internet security software might slow your internet down so I would just recommend sticking with Windows Firewall/Defender.",3,4
9SIA0AJ5BS4717,34-131-403,4/10/2014 12:44:17 PM,Marcus W.,Nice,4," Fast, Small (or slim I should say) does exactly what I need it to do. I pondered what kind of laptop to get myself for the longest and with so many on the market that are only appealing for the bells and whistles; I had to narrow down exactly what I wanted the laptop for and how much I would be willing to spend on it. All i really wanted was something that could get me on any wifi network I have access to, could handle all my internet based tasks as well as office/offline work, had storage for any other data I needed to transfer and allowed me to have basic productivity at my fingertips on the go. Didn't want a full-blown laptop with power that wouldn't be necessary seeing as how if I need anything intense I can just use the desktops I build. Just wanted to access spreadsheets and emails and autotask with a nice sized screen and a bit of mobile pc power.So to sum this up, the Chromebook was just a no-brainer buy for me (once my brain wrapped around it's usefulness). I've always loved the chrome browser and I use it on my main PC, my iphone, and both my galaxy tablet and LG phone. So having a laptop that runs strictly off the Chrome OS was really nothing new to me but I did have to explore the actual OS to understand certain features/tricks that chrome had to offer.Key Qualities: Fast boot, no real lengthy software installs, plenty of apps (although they could be a lot better) no nonsens, works right out the box. All you need is a gmail account. battery life is great on a single charge I can go a full work day with minimal usage. Oh yeah and it has a memory card reader. Definitely a great purcase. Chromebook for the basic usage WIN!!!"," As I mentioned the apps or great but they have the potential to be 100x better but it's a baby OS so we'll see how far google can take it and hopefully the devs (google or otherwise) will create apps with more kick. As far as the design goes, this complaint goes to samsung for their port layout. Having everything in the back kind of sucks  I have to move the notebook around to access my USB's or plug in the power cable. As opposed to just having everything accessible on the sides, glad at least the Memory card reader got a side slot. That's my only con, as I said I knew what I wanted and this was exactly what I was looking for at a price that just makes sense."," Next I'll be getting a touchscreen one and I'll probably give this one away to someone who needs it just because. Don't misunderstand this though, I love it and will use it until I get the touch one, it absolutely does what's advertised.",4,4

See below.Would be nice to have one of the USB 3.0 ports on the right. At least the HDMI and VGA aren't right next to each other so you can use both."," To access the RAM/HD you'll need to flip the laptop upside down, remove all the screws. Take out the CD drive blank. It's best to start in a corner and pop up one set of clips. Run a small metal tool in the gap and you'll pop up the clips around the laptop. Don't yank off the bottom cover as there is a cable connecting the motherboard to the speakers, which isn't a ribbon cable and is easily removed. From there, you have easy access.

Some reviewers complained about the functions of touch pad and keyboard, but honestly, I am totally fine and like it.  Maybe those reviewers got spoiled by their previous laptop.  Nothing wrong with it.  It has 1 TB HD 5400 rpm.  I thought that the hard drive could be very slow to load Win 10, but when I tried after I received it, it wasn't that bad.  It loads quicker than I thought.  Windows might be getting slow down if there are a lot of programs installed in this computer.  However, if you use light gaming, or using MS office, or surfing the internet, this will do fine.  Computer usually gets slow down as time goes.  I am planning to get SSD soon.  It seems to be difficult to install, but you can buy ssd caddy and placed into the blank optical drive bay.  There are extra bay that you can add HD or SSD.  Any caddy that is compatible with Acer would work.  I bought caddy from newegg, and installed into the extra bay.  I haven't tried yet putting ssd yet, but it is possible for you to install on the extra bay either dvd or  ssd or hd.  $499.99 with these specs.  I wouldn't complain about it.  Other company such as Asus, HP, or MSI, you would pay extra $100 or more to get these specs.  If you know how to upgrade your machine, this would be very good base to make it better.   Runs ok with CS-Go game within auto adjust setting.  Very playable.  NO complain about this."," Pre-installed McAfee Virus program can cause Google Chrome to open and loading the page slow in the beginning.  Don't put or allow Pre-installed McAfee virus into the chrome.  It caused me to figure out how to make chrome works better.  4 GB graphic card, but can't use more than 2 GB.  But, still it is descent graphic memory.     It is better to use mouse than mouse touch pad.  The arrow key, I wish the arrow key looks like normal keyboard, but this doesn't cause any big trouble."," Great product with the good price.  I don't think any gaming laptop can come up with these specs.

If the bulk of your computing takes place in a web browser, you will find the Chromebooks meet your needs.   find my Samsung runs Chrome fairly fast, about the same as a decent Window-based laptop with a fast Internet connection.  There are a fair number of ""offline apps"" now, so you can do many functions if no Internet is available:  word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, file operations including videos and music, e-books, e-mail editing, games, etc.I like the full-size keyboard and the trackpad.  The screen is 11 inches on the diagonal, and the speakers are loud (though a bit tinny).  The display is crisp and clear; the surface is a dull matte finish which I strongly prefer over the glossy, glaring surface that most screens seem to have these days.  Wireless connection was extremely simple to setup, and connection strength seems very good.  There are ports for an SD card, USB 2 and USB 3, and HDMI. The weight is only a little over 1 kilogram, and I find that the battery life is pretty decent – about 6 hours of web-browsing."," If you need to run specific Windows-based software, this is probably not the computer for you. I read some comments from folks who say the shell is ‘creaky’, but I find the construction and materials to be reasonably solid – about the same as any other sub-$500 laptop."," I think it is the ideal device for someone who would be okay with a tablet, but wants a full-size real keyboard rather than touch screen.",4,4

Mouse pad is pretty bad it likes to jump around sometimes or be over sensitive making clicks where there were none. The hard drive comes formatted as gpt which makes it hard to dual boot with 7 without reformatting the entire drive.(the reason i wanted to install 7 was some older mmo i play dont agree with windows 8/10 and have issues.) Tons of bloatware, even doing a windowsreset didnt get rid of it. It also comes with an acer boot logo splash screen. took off one egg for the bloatware and pointless gpt format on hard drive less than 2tb in size."," Half the reviews made this sound like a cheap toy with decent hardware inside i wasnt sure what to expect but overall i believe the quality is great.

It boots in seconds, and, since it's running on a SSD, it's just fast in general.  Chrome OS is an ingenious idea, and it functions exactly as expected.   The remote desktop function is a big plus."," I think the operating system could use a little refining to make it easier to get used to, but some things can be remedied with apps."," Just remember that this device is meant for low-stress tasks, and you'll be alright.

I had the extra drive already so I didn't have to buy one, that may be a consideration for others when factoring the cost.

Unfortunately, there's no way to gauge what type of response to expect beforehand. It's jittery, sluggish, and -Bloatware. Seriously, why do manufacturers insist on installing software that only bogs down what would otherwise be a decent machine? I took an extra star simply because some of the ACER programs will re-create unwanted desktop shortcuts after I already removed them.- I'm typically a function over form type guy, but the brushed look on the exterior seems to conflict with the sterile greys on the inside.- Based on the look of the back panel, trying to replace the HDD with an SSD is going to be a royal pain."," - I avoided Windows 8 like the plague.

So this made my transition to this machine seamless. I think that helped, because I didn't have to learn anything or start using something new.This Chromebook is under $250. Think about that. It is a internet browser machine. And that works for me amazingly well. My interest in this Chromebook was to purchase the smallest most compact laptop that was the most affordable. I have a homebuilt gaming pc that is my work horse for everything, but I wanted mobility for some little tasks. This thing is great. IT's small, the hardware is great, the battery holds up, it feels like a much more expensive system than it is mostly because there is minimal software, and it is very simple. It is light, and plastic, but that also makes the arguement that it is not precious. If this thing fails, or is stolen off the subway, it is not a huge investment, and everything on it is most likely on the cloud already. I didn't think I would start using this as much as I do. I missed a traditional laptop. I have a tablet and a Galaxy note 2. But it feels pretty good to use a laptop to browse and type and operate. It is a great in between from the phone/tablet and desktop pc and it is so affordable. This should be the future for mobile computing. Every desktop owner should have one of these to bridge the gap of mobility that a PC lacks. This serves as a 90/10 split. My PC has all the power and utility, this has mobility and ease of use. It's too cheap not to try, I really enjoy it."," I would say that the 2 year 100 gig free of Google drive is awesome, but it would be more cool if it was 4 years, and lasted the life of this machine.I can't say if google will convince me to subscribe when my 2 years are up but I would like plenty of time to have a reason to.

I'm a Chromebook. My story is a sad one with a happy ending; my original Master purchased me and immediately sent me back to whence I came, presumably because I wasn't worthy to be of service to him. I was quite sad, but instead of being banished to die, I was given new life as an ""open box"" item, and another Master took me as his own. As it stands, Master enjoys me dearly and has asked me to let the world know just why, so that you too may enjoy my brothers and sisters.I'm exceedingly light. You'll notice as soon as you lift me from my box that I weigh close to nothing. If you come from a world of my heavy, bulky brothers and sisters, it may take a while to get used to my slender frame. That's okay; I'm worth adjusting to.I'm an endurance champ. My battery provides me with the juice to last anywhere from 4 to 6 hours depending on how you choose to use me. When you plug me in, I charge up quickly - 2 hours or less fills me all the way up from the brink of emptiness.I'm quick. Master often likens me to a Miata - Quick, not fast. My heart spins with the fury of a 1.7GHz hurricane, and my brain carries its thoughts across 2 speedy Gigabytes. I'm not strong enough to run many games, and if you try to crunch large video files on me, I might just pass out. However, I chomp through web-based applications like they're nothing, and since I'm a dual-core I am a competent multitasker too.I look good. People often approach me and ask if I'm a Macbook Air. Master just chuckles and says I'm far better than that. My 11-inch screen is bright and clear, and my clean, modern aesthetics suggest that I'm very high quality (which, by the way, I am).I'm comfortable. Master is a proficient typist, and he initially worried that I might not be as enjoyable to use as some other, higher-dollar pieces of hardware he's used in the past. However, he now brags that my keys are some of the best, most responsive ones he's ever set finger upon.I'm cool. Literally. Set me on a table, your lap, even a fuzzy blanket, and I won't ever get hot. My cool is natural too - I have no fans to move air around inside me. In fact, I'm pretty sure I don't have any parts that actually move inside me at all!I'm smarter than I realize. My programmers originally told me I was built only to consume and use the internet, and I foolishly believed them. Master has since told me this was a lie, and liberated me with ""Linux."" Now I can do so much more! I hope all my other brothers and sisters have Masters as cool as mine.I'm amazing. I'm a Chromebook. Treat me with love, and I'll be yours forever.",13,19

Chrome OS loads incredibly fast, there are many very useful apps to be found in the app store, fantastic price and the suite of services Google offer makes this a great budget computer. Battery life is fantastic and build quality is surprisingly solid. The keyboard is accurate and very comfortable to use and I fell in love with the touchpad."," Occasionally the physical click on the touchpad sticks, I have read a couple of other people have the same issue but it is rare. Also if you're prone to having a whole bunch of tabs open at once, Chrome OS can chug a little bit. I guess you could see it as another way to encourage you to keep things lean and productive right?"," I'm not sure about the review below talking about ""discovering"" the touchpad can click and how they miss having a second click. You learn these in a short and friendly tutorial in about 20 seconds after you've booted to your new desktop. A tap with two fingers gives you the second click, easy,As long as you have realistic expectations about what you're getting for this bargain price, ie nothing like the functionality of a regular Windows/Apple/Linux machine, you're getting amazing bang for your buck.

The front and back sides of the laptop are slanted, so it makes it very easy to open and close it."," First of all, the screen has horrible viewing angles. You have to look at the screen at the right angle to get mediocre viewing at best. Color reproduction seems very poor, and maximum brightness isn't high at all. The screen shows some glare which can get annoying. The 5400rpm hard drive is slow as expected, but you can install a ssd in the blank dvd slot with a caddy adapter.  It just takes one simple screw to pull the dummy dvd tray out. Bloatware is minimal so it wasn't that bad to uninstall them."," At this price point, this laptop rocks in terms of  value.

From this experience, I can only assume that it is best to wait a few more years for the bugs to be worked out of the Chrome OS. In addition, the hardware is just too slow.

First off you have to be aware of what you are buying, this will not be like any laptop you have ever used, infact this won't be like anything you have ever used. This is just a web browser through and through, with apps. The laptop is more current now so more then ever, with ""cloud computing"" becoming a huge thing in the market, Chromebooks are literally made for cloud computing. This laptop is inexpensive, but fast, it starts up in under 4 seconds, and then your browsing the web. Microsoft office 365 works perfectly with this device, or you can use google docs if your professors don't mind it. Now you can't install microsoft office, but by paying the 10$ a month fee, you can use the full office suite on microsofts ""skydrive"" and there is literally no difference between it and the install able version.  Spotify and Rdio both have web players that work great for the chromebook, not to mention the chromebooks own media player. Netflix works amazingly, I like it a little better then on normal computers to be honest. Steam has a web based chat program with notifications that are fully compatible with Chrome. As does most other instant messengers. The HDMI out is a really nice little thing that I did not expect to ever find on these laptops, that make them all the more useful for netflix. The keyboard is the best keyboard I have every used, worked can't really explain it but the keyboard is top notch, I wish google sold them separably so that I could use it on my main build.  The mousepad is really sensitive, and easy to use after you get use to it (see cons) The laptop never gets hot, the battery lasts for hours, the SSD speeds this thing up like nothing else, the USB 3.0 is a nice addition for those who want an external harddrive. The screen is really nice for the price of this laptop, decently bright, and is good for what you need it for. I have not had any lag with this yet, I had 30 tabs open and not one problem."," The mousepad is tricky at first, I can see what google was trying to do, but they could of avoided all problems but including a built in right click into the mousepad."," With adobe entering into the cloud computing world with photoshop, this laptop will be able to do everything. The packaging for this is a wonderful box that is very protective of the laptop. Don't be scared of this laptop, it is a very powerful machine, that sooner rather then latter will be just as valid as a 12 hundred dollar laptop.",9,10

I'm a student, so I basically just have WiFi on, moderate brightness on Google Docs for a few hours a day. At home I'll use it for YouTube, Google Play Music, reddit, facebook, etc. Those uses eat up battery a bit more. It performs almost perfectly for all these things, except occasionally YouTube. Some tweaking and I got it running generally how I want it. Keyboard and trackpad are great. The two-finger right click is intuitive and hard to not try to use on my Windows laptop. Side note: I hardly turn on that hunk of junk anymore because most things I want to do I can do on my Chromebook, and it does them better. For the $250, there is nothing better for my purposes. Chrome OS made me realize how much I can really live in the Cloud or already did. Don't have Netflix myself, but it is updated to work on Chrome OS now. Xfinity (which uses Hulu) works just fine."," Screen could be higher resolution, but I'd fear text would be tiny if that were the case, on non-scaling websites. It also auto-adjusts brightness, and as far as I know, you cannot change this. (Un)fortunately it does so rapidly; simply putting my head slightly more in the way can change it. The bottom 30% of the brightness meter is pretty much useless. Too dark for almost any normal usage scenario except dead of night. I find my sweet spot is typically just about 50%.  It failed to play a Blu-ray 1080p rip at an acceptable framerate. I forget what the file type was. Local or USB and SD storage don't tell you how full they are. The local media player is more of a sound player. No playlist function or browsing by artist. Have your music organized by folders. Some weird behavior with YouTube and my plugin, YouTube Options. Still trying to get to the bottom of that."," The Microsoft optical USB mouse I have has a very low sensitivity with Chrome OS's mouse sensitivity maxed out, so I try not to use it. I have another USB mouse I may grab this weekend; hopefully it has better sensitivity.The HDMI port automatically pumps audio out, cutting the speakers, unless you plug headphones in.

If everything you do is on Google Chrome, this seems like an ideal solution (and it is, for a while). The system boots up quickly and you login using your existing Google account. All of your existing Chrome extensions and apps automatically pop up, there's no going around and searching for stuff to install.", The Chromebook does not work with an external display. I'm not sure why they bothered placing an HDMI port on it. Google and Samsung are apparently aware of the issue and are working to resolve it but we can't keep replacing Chromebooks while they fix it.," We purchased two of these for our business to, sort of, beta test before buying them for all the employees. I'm very glad we only started with two! The idea was to provide our employees with a work station and a mobile cpu for a really great value. The employee can plug it into a monitor and wireless keyboard & mouse and at the end of the day, unplug it and take it home with them. The idea would work perfectly if the Chromebook didn't crash when plugging it in to an external display. The first one lasted about 2 days, the second lasted for almost a month.",5,9

In my experience dealing with laptops/netbooks I've never owned one that was able to handle much more than and internet browser and sometimes could barely handle that because they were so burdened with background processes to function. Google got it perfect for people who only need to take a laptop around to surf the web and use google docs. It is completely silent due to no moving parts, starts up in seconds, simple user settings interface, and all I have to do is open and close the lid to resume and pause my work. I can also watch Netflix without any lag at all. The touchpad is one of the best I have ever used. And the pricetag was perfect! I was able to get the computer, case, and one year accidental damage warranty for a grand total of 281 dollars.

The hardware (with the exception of the perfect keyboard) is more or less what one would expect out of a $250 computer, but it's packaged rather nicely and handles everything the internet and Chrome OS have to offer with ease. Complaints about the Chrome OS have always bewildered me: buying one of these, attempting and failing to install a new video game, and then whining about limited functionality is almost like buying any expensive electronic device, taking it swimming, and then whining after breaking it because you thought it would probably be waterproof. It just doesn't make sense. Do your research before picking one of these up. Chrome OS is the best at what it does - that is, providing all the basics within a snappy, easy-to-use operating system. It's perfect for people like me, but if you need consistent access to an extensive suite of programs that don't yet have web-based replacements, you may want to look elsewhere (or determine whether or not Chrome's remote desktop function will do the trick).",12,12

Battery life is very good.," The A/C adapter doesn't insert all the way onto the device leaving it looking flimsy and cheap.  The touchpad is also push sensitive, like a mouse button, so because the case is a little flimsy, holding it wrongly can trigger a mouse button press.  That is probably the biggest annoyance.  When resuming from standy it takes some time for the Wi-Fi to come back.  Instead of just reconnecting to the last network, it completely rescans for available networks, before connecting.  The Bluetooth only works with keyboards and mice, so don't get your hopes up if you're hoping to connect to your Android device via Bluetooth."," The keyboard and gestures touchpad take a little getting used to, but they're not bad.  In fact the gestures concept is kind of interesting, and I find myself occasionally trying to use gestures on laptop touchpads.  Bottom line, it's the Internet on the cheap, so as long as you're not expecting much more than that, you won't be disappointed.",4,4

You have everything you need in one place! music, photos, documents, ect. Google offers 100gb free storage for 2 years so that's nice! Plus 5gb free that comes with gmail. There are so many things you can do with it that the things you cant, aren't too bothersome. There are lots of apps and extensions for mostly anything you need. Battery life is awesome! I found myself forgetting about my battery often and when I realized that I had not charged in a while, I looked at the battery level and it would be at 52%!!! ;D Yeah like I said, Awesome! Speakers are loud. Camera is good. Another pro, Google play gives you 20,000 song storage to upload for free!"," Laptop scratches VERY EASY! The first day I received it, I had no clue how easy it was to scratch. I had my external drive next to it, when I picked it up it scrapped the side of the laptop a bit SMH! After that I have been very careful with it. If you travel alot I suggest you buy a case or sleeve for it. Itunes does NOT work. So you can't sync your ipod! That sucks since I used itunes for all music related activities. But if you use this as a second laptop (like me) then there is no problem. Just sync your ipod with your windows/mac and that wont really be a big deal. Another pro/con kindof, is that after the 2 years you can keep what you already used BUT you can't add more unless you purchase. If you delete anything you can't replace. Something I've noticed while playing Angry birds is that the trackpad is not very responsive at times. Maybe its the game but I'm not really sure. Syncing all your files to google drive is a pain in the A@#! It takes veryyy longgg! specially if you have a large collection of music! I stored all my pictures on google drive but have yet to uploaded all my music. Instead, I decided to add my music to google play, for some reason upload time was faster."," In my opinion this is a great laptop if you want something portable, light weight and fast! This laptop works great as a second laptop. The screen is just like the ones you would find on any regular laptop, In my opinion, its not that bad. If you have never experienced a really good screen then you wont know the difference! Something that is not very clear is when you shut the lid, the computer goes to sleep but it is still consuming battery, just at a lower rate! This is something to keep in mind if you are traveling without a charger or wont be able to charge for a while. Some people might be scared of the fact that you need a wireless connection but its simple just tether your phones internet connection if you don't have access to a wireless network and you are good to go! I have used this laptop with many tabs open and seems to work fine.I gave this laptop a 4 star rating because of how easily it scratches and for not being compatible with itunes. If it weren't for that it would be perfect 5 star rating! I love my chromebook!! :)",4,5

I also downloaded Chromium OS and ran it on an older Dell compact laptop for a few weeks. I was looking for something with long battery life, and was considering a larger tablet with a keyboard case or dock. The ASUS Transformer series in particular. I like Android, but I was intrigued by Chrome, and after a couple days with my Chromebook, I'm very happy with my decision.The Keyboard is very good for a laptop, if a little bit noisier than I'd like. The spacing and key size are really good for any laptop, and especially for the overall size. The trackpad is excellent, too - I have a couple wireless mice, but haven't felt the need to plug one in yet. Scrolling and tapping are very responsive, but the click takes a little more effort than I'd like. Not a big deal, just something to note.I'd read a lot of complaints about the screen, too, but I don't think it's that bad. It's not IPS, but it's quite good at the right angle. No worse than a lot of laptops, IMHO, and for the screen size, not a problem at all.Also, I love the long battery life, low heat in use, and the near-instant wake from sleep. Shutting down and starting up take a bit longer, but going back to a ""real"" OS is a little shocking. Overall, for the price point, the hardware is fantastic.

Here are my perspectives after the first few weeks with it.1. This thing runs fast - I don't know what other people are talking about who say this thing doesn't run fast enough.  HD video runs seamlessly, even if I am browsing other stuff on separate tabs.2. Start up time is unbelievable. I am doing 7 seconds from off to asking for my password.3. The 100GB of free Drive storage for two years is easy to activate and works well - no problem with accessing files and docs reads tons of different file formats.4. The keyboard and trackpad work great.  I'm coming from a ThinkPad where I used that nub in the middle of the keyboard, so moving to a trackpad was an adjustment for me - two finger scrolling, zooming in and out with two fingers in Maps, etc. works great.  The keyboard is as good as my desktop keyboard.5.  The screen is definitely sufficiently bright enough and hi-res enough, and the matte finish helps.  Viewing angles could be better, but I'm not looking to have 2-3 people looking at the screen on this thing at once, so for one person it is great.6. This thing is totally silent and doesn't get hot like your typical laptop.7. Installing Ubuntu on this device is easy, just search for Chrubuntu online.  It's a nice way to run a Java environment if you need to."," This is a Chromebook so arguing that it is not a traditional OS that you can install apps on is a specious argument, so it is absurd to say that is a con for this device.The only thing I could come up with is that maybe the screen could be a little better (not in terms of resolution, more just the lighting and viewing angles)."," Very impressed with performance for price - the value here is incredible, especially for those who already pay for Google Drive.  Probably 95% of what normally do can be done on my Chromebook without changing my behavior, and the other 5% I can probably do if I get a little more ""cloud-centric"" with my approach.I highly recommend this device to people who are casual browsers, people who need basic productivity tools (docs, calendar, email) that don't play video games much, and power users who want a tablet alternative with an excellent keyboard.",16,18

There are those who will tell you ""I knew what I was getting into when I ordered this Chromebook..."" that is just code for ""I'm an idiot and I was so cheap that I wasn't willing to spend an extra $150 to purchase a real laptop."" (I was going to give it to my Mom for Christmas, but decided her old Pentium 4 Sony Vaio was better so I upgraded the RAM and bought a new battery for it and sold the Chromebook). The screen viewing angle is basically 3mm. You have to pinpoint the angle or else you are viewing black screen or looking at a mirror image of yourself. I KNEW THIS, but the memory can't be upgraded, nor can the hard disk. What I didn't know is that the desktop wasn't used for anything. Everything is done through Chrome. The Arm dual core A15 CPu is the most overrated piece of trash ever produced. The quad core version is used in a $300 cell phone, but Google was so cheap, they settled for the dual core. The Mali GPU (yeah I researched it for a few DAYS before ordering) is so overrated as well. I could barely play a Facebook slot game without extreme stuttering. Flash games are terrible on it. Streaming video is also choppy and worse than my 11 year old Pentium 4's iGPU. In fact, the overall performance of this device is comparable to an early Pentium 4 or late Pentium 3."," Good thing these pieces of junk are in high demand. I actually sold the device (it doesn't deserve to be called a laptop and Google knows that) for $280 online 16 minutes after posting it. I then ordered an Asus laptop with a 15 inch screen, an i5 3210m, a 500 GB hard disk, 4 GB of ram (up to 8 GB) and a nice little HD 4000 iGPU all for $420. So, For exactly $170 more, the Asus is able to do everything the Chromebook can do INCLUDING INSTANT BOOT, and do it faster and can do a million billion gazillion things that the Chrome device cannot, one of which is play Battlefield 3. So let the Chrome device owners try to convince themselves that they got exactly what they wanted while their youtube video stutters and the 3rd tab they opened maxes out their memory (no virtual memory LOL WUT!) and let them try to convince themselves that their Chrome device is still fun to own while their repertoire of games is limited to Texas Hold Em, Facebook slots, Angry Birds and some pathetic version of Command and Conquer. Oh, uh, it updates itself and is virus free. Yeah? That is because it is Ubuntu with a Google logo pasted on it. I can install Ubuntu on my laptop and sit there and say the same thing. Enough. Let em live in the most pathetic denial storm ever. For anyone else who got suckered into blindly ordering one, SELL IT NOW AND BUY A REAL LAPTOP. Or BURN IT WITH FIRE!",9,95
9SIA0AJ5BS4717,34-131-403,12/22/2012 3:39:45 PM,Brandon W.,,5, Doesn't take up a lot of space and is very light. Good for watching videos or movies on the go. Probably the greatest value netbook you can get at the moment unless you buy something used. The hardware in general is very good., Because it is a netbook it cant do certain things. Do your research and think about exactly what you are going to be using your laptop for. 1 or 2 more USB ports would have been nice but I think that might be asking for a lot at this price point.," If you are an ""advanced"" user you will not like the OS it comes with. The good news is the support for linux distros is growing for this laptop. It works fantastically with a linux distro. The chrome OS is fine for your grandma or someone who is not very good with tech.",2,3
9SIA0AJ5BS4717,34-131-403,12/14/2012 4:43:50 PM,Anonymous,"I love this thing, does everything it says it will and more!",5," Super fast.  Boot up to desktop is about 6 seconds.  The keyboard is great.  I was used to a chiclet keyboard on my old 10"" netbook and this is much better.  The screen is sharp and I like that it is matte and not shiny so there are no glare issues.  The sound on this is impressive, did not expect it to be so loud and clear.  And best of all, NO FAN!!!!  It is quiet and stays cool.  Automatic Antivirus and OS updates are superb.  No more pop ups that say ""windows needs to restart to update"".  Then have to wait for 10 minutes for it to do its thing.  It automatically updates when Chrome releases an update and they are applied the next time you restart.  No waiting or annoying pop ups, it does it on its own in the background."," The only complaints I have are that I am still waiting for Netflix and Skype to work, but I know they are working on it.  Some people are reporting issues with BT pairing but again, they are working on it.  Look how long Apple took to fix the maps app after they released the new iPhone 5.  They knew the app was faulty but they released it anyway."," Do your research before purchasing.  I knew exactly what I was getting and it has far exceeded my expectations.  I wanted to replace my netbook with something slightly bigger.  I use my netbook for web browsing only, some photo storage.  This thing has been great for both of those.  If you are going to complain and say things like ""it wont work with iTunes, I cant use Office,  I cant play Skyrim, I cant upgrade the hard drive"" then you did not do sufficient research before purchasing it.  These things were never promised, nor intended for it.  It is a Chrome OS based notebook.  It is Web based.  They give you 100MB free Cloud storage which should be sufficient for what this is intended for, Web based applications.  There are plenty of apps to use and if you take the time to explore it, they offer many apps that are just like programs you are used to and some you already know.",7,8
9SIA0AJ5BS4717,34-131-403,12/13/2012 1:08:22 PM,JOCELYN M.,Not for enthusiasts,3," Fast cold boot, about 10 seconds. Fast wake up, almost instant. Very cheap. Nice design. Works well for what it can do.", Limited viewing angle. Small 16 GB hard drive. The desktop is not used. Limited offline use. Cannot upgrade RAM or hard disk. Auto dims screen.," The chromebook is a web browser and a glorified typewriter. If you want a real laptop, get the cheaper Acer chromebook, install Windows or Ubuntu, upgrade the RAM to 4 GB and you have one. This is a nice device for someone like my mom who only uses computers for web browsing and email. If you are an enthusiast who likes to play modern PC games, this is the last thing you want. I'm glad I have a 3770k PC as well or else this Chromebook would be completely useless. I am only using it for web surfing.",4,19
9SIA0AJ5BS4717,34-131-403,12/12/2012 8:15:42 AM,Steven L.,DOA,1, Looks nice," Dead on Arrival - when arrived, screen showed ""Chome OS missing or damaged, please create recovery drive"".  So I created the recovery using my imac, tried to reinstall Chrome OS on the Chromebook and it failed the first time, then succeeded (not really) the second time.  When trying to log in, machine froze and reset to the ""Chrome OS Missing or Damaged"" screen.  Have yet to get the Chromebook to operate.  Because it is such a hot item, Newegg does not have a replacement and won't put me on a waiting list, so I'm stuck just refreshing the page all the time hoping to score a working model.  Very Frustrating.",,6,22
9SIA0AJ5BS4717,34-131-403,12/11/2012 5:13:57 PM,Peter N.,You cannot do much with it,3," Inexpensive and does what it intends well.  Keyboard and touchpad are not bad at all.  Very light and portable.  Good battery life.Can dual boot Linux-- awkwardly now and with hope for better support later, but running from SDHC card will be slow."," Screen view angle is poor.  The whole thing creaks a little.  But the main problem is with the Chromebook concept itself.  The Google ecosystem (gmail, docs, youtube, play, maps, etc.) works well, but almost nothing else is available (other than by major hackery involving Linux).   No netflix (at least at this time), no silverlight, no java, no VPN access that is worth much.  The app set available is very unimpressive.  Google play media content is also unimpressive.  Perhaps these will grow better with time, and the chromebook will become more useful.As a simple computer for someone with modest google-only goals, it is OK.  But maybe not for the grandparents because it is too small for easy reading.Performance of the ARM cortex-a15 appears similar to that of a very low-end x86.",,3,8
9SIA0AJ5BS4717,34-131-403,12/10/2012 8:24:33 AM,Craig B.,Nice Machine some drawbacks,4, Nice and small machine. Very solid. Keyboard is very very nice. Runs most applications very well., Netflix doesn't work as of yet. Charger is very bulky. When put through some normal test such as running video on one tab and another website on another tab. The video was very choppy. These are not really Cons. It is a great machine for the cost. It does what it is intended to do., Can't beat 250$ for a small machine like this. Very solid and great for what is intended for mobility.,5,5

Casual and power web users can enjoy the full potential of this device.", Hinge. It is ugly but I would rather sacrifice looks then range of motion. The display is limited which is expected the low cost system if it could open 15-25 degrees more it would be a bonus.," When you factor value of 100G of google drive. this device costs $130. overall. My Xoom weighs more then this. This is not optimized as a media device it is a gateway to whats there on the web. Speakers are ok.. better the expected, though.",1,1
9SIA0AJ5BS4717,34-131-403,12/9/2012 5:03:14 AM,Celestino N.,Would have been great if only...,3," This laptop excels on so many levels. Its fast, cheap, portable, doesn't run hot, boots fast, runs ChomeOS, feels well built, and is unique in that it doesn't have an x86 chip or Windows, while still proving a great web experience."," This laptop could have been great if only for the display. I didn't have high expectations, but the vertical viewing angles are terrible and colors appear washed out. I was lucky to get one of the free Chromebooks, the CR-48, and in a side-by-side comparison of the displays, it exceeds the Samsung in viewing angles, contrast and overall brightness. I wasn't expecting a IPS display, but I was hoping that it would at least match a product that was given out for free. The display reminds of me of my first IBM Thinkpad from 1995. I prefer matte screens over glossy ones, but this particular matte screen is one of the worst I've seen."," I realize that this review may come across as harsh, but as a buyer I wish I knew about the poor quality of the display before I bought it. This laptop does so many things so well, and I really wish I could have given it a higher score, but the display really hurts an otherwise excellent laptop.",5,7

It's not a Windows replacement, it's not a Mac OS X replacement, it's not even a Linux replacement.  It's a ChromeOS machine.

9SIA0AJ3NS9287,34-315-065,8/27/2015 3:48:58 PM,Kevin K.,,4," Probably the best specs you can get on a laptop at this price. 1080p screen, decent (albeit ULV) current-gen i5 with hyperthreading and turbo boost, Windows 10, GeForce 940M for light gaming. Good battery life. Fairly lightweight. I'd heard a lot about Acer ""bloatware"" but found very little."," To get these specs at this budget, you give up a fair bit. No DVD drive. The screen is below-average in terms of color and viewing angle, like a budget TN panel. The touchpad is janky enough that I switched to a mouse quickly.

(also 32-bit OS)It's not Windows 10 Home. As a result many of the drivers are out of date or completely incompatible. Ex. gtx 940m cannot be used by This laptop because the current drivers are unsupported in the insider preview.

9SIA0AJ5BS4717,34-131-403,11/30/2012 10:17:16 AM,Michael M.,Good not Great,4," The connectivity of this device is impressive given the market niche this laptop is aimed at. I honestly don't know if I'll ever use the usb 3.0, but it is nice to have. The keyboard is great to type on. The browsing is perfectly adequate. The form factor is attractive."," I love the idea of chrome OS, but this laptop still has some issues. Not being able to watch netflix out of the box is almost a deal breaker for me. I know a fix is coming, but lets face it, they should have had this figured out before releasing it. The trackpad sounds cheap and its loud. When I click on the trackpad I cringe at the sound it makes. I know you can just tap it, but unfortunately chrome OS doesn't let you set the sensitivity settings for the track pad and my taps are just too light. Within the first few days of owning it the top of the lid started to get scuff marks on it, which is frustrating because it takes away that ""shiny-new-toy"" feeling you get from owning a new gadget and seriously detracts from the form factor. Its not like this thing was abused, but I had it next to a book and some papers in my messenger bag and the paint appears to be rubbing off just from being in contact with other flat objects. And one final thing, sometimes I would manually have to reconnect the wifi every time I woke the device form sleep on certain networks, although this wasn't an issue with my home network."," Lets be clear: I knew what this was when I bought it and overall I still think its an amazing value, but my grievances aren't alone and these little things could have been fixed/prevented. Once they are, I see this as being THE small/cheap alternative to the tablet craze and the soul-crusher of netbooks. Samsung and Google really have something special here, now I hope they perfect it.",4,4

Computer starts up very fast, and automatically syncs and updates everything for you. I logged in and in 30 seconds it had all my settings and favorites all set."," The track pad is decent, maybe im just not used to it yet. Works fine, just not as responsive with the scrolling as i thought, sure i will get used to it by tomorrow. Also the back of the laptop isnt very impressive, just a Google logo and Samsung text. I personally could care less about appearance so it doesn't bother me."," This machine is absolutely amazing. The keyboard is amazing, the screen is clean, its super fast, and its only $250 bucks!!! Im a college student and this was the perfect purchase for somebody in my price bracket. Google docs work great, tons of apps, and no distractions like installed games to take you off your work.

I have read there are ways to use a flash boot drive combined with a partitioned SD Card to get ARM-based OS working, but have not tried and this would not be something you would want to spend countless hours deploying.Taking these apart is not as easy as previous Chromebook machines due to their size. There is literally not room for a different SSD, so if you want to get clever and swap the SSD out, you will have to be quite industrious.For anyone reading this who used the CR-48 or original series 5 chromebook and wants something similar but better - this is definitely better. If you already have a 550, the only advantage of this machine is it is slightly lighter and quieter as it is about half the speed of the 550 in most cases.I would highly recommend this machine to someone who made the mistake of introducing one of their family members to a 550 and would like to at least get that machine back.",8,9
