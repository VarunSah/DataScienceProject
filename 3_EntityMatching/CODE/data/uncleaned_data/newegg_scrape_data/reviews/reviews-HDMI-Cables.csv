I purchased this splitter for mirroring this secondary display to my 47"" LCD TV. The root of the problem is when Xorg starts the video driver (nVidia) reads the EDID from displays and configures it's output accordingly. Having two displays (with different parameters) on same output creates great deal of confusion. I saw my Dell monitor turning off protecting itself from incompatible modes, etc.The solution is following:Disconnect your TV and save EDID from your monitor into a file (e. g. 'get-edid > Dell.bin'). You may need to install read-edid package first. Put this binary into /etc/X11/, next edit your xorg.conf and add 'Option ""CustomEDID"" ""DFP-1:/etc/X11/Dell.bin' to relevant Monitor section. Voila! Next time you start X the EDID will not be pulled from multiple displays you have connected to a single output, it will be read from the file instead.Of course, if your splitter is not connected to DFP-1 or your monitor can do better than your TV then you have to adjust the above to suit your setup.",1,1

I tried one at a time; no signal out on the hdmi. I eventually I got a flashing and intermittent signal on the dvi when I had only that plugged in.  RMA today to newegg.  I think newegg must have a fast track RMA for this know defective product.  They are a great company, but they really should leave this off the product line.",2,2

I plugged it in and there was no signal to my monitor. I played around with the connectors a little bit and finally an image appeared on my monitor but the entire screen was covered in errant pixels in neon green and pink.I then tried plugging an HDMI cable into it and my TV and the image on my monitor became clear and a clear image showed up on my TV. However, for some reason my graphics card was forced to switch to some weird resolution in 4:3 format so the image was stretched. If I tried changing the resolution the screen would go blank until restart.Also, no HDCP support. Awesome.I CAN CONFIRM THE OTHER REVIEW. DO NOT BUY.",2,2

It doesn't need an external power source to function like other converter/switch boxes might need.  It auto-detects which source has signal so you don't need to constantly get up to push the switch button.  For example, i have 3 game systems connected to my switch. When all systems are off, i get ""no signal"" on my tv screen. As soon as i turn a system on, the switch detects which system it is and boom, I get video signal.  Doesn't matter if it's port 1, port 2, or port 3, it will activate the correct port by itself.And it only runs one signal at a time, so don't worry about blowing out the switch by turning all three systems at once. it will only output the video for the first system it received signal for, then you can press the switch button to manually jump to the other ports if you feel the need to have all three devices on at once. Just note the warning about ""hot plugging"" your devices (this is when you connect the hdmi cable from your device to the splitter while your device is on/hot). Just make sure your device is off before plugging anything in to the splitter to be safe.Otherwise, you can set this up behind your tv and not worry about having to reach it, it does a pretty good job of doing everything on it's own.Great solution to adding more HDMI ports to your TV, and at a great price.",None,None

Ethernet Cable M-M - Great Value on Sale,5," - 50 ft. long HDMI cable.- Very Inexpensive on Sale.- Transmits HD Data, Video, & Audio Streams without problems.- Shielded Cable is Tough & Flexible.- End Connectors are Sturdy.I got these cables with a 50% off sale and free shipping.   The price for a 50 ft. cable was way less than any retail store is selling a 12 ft cable.   Since these work, I think the price/value ratio is EXCELLENT."," - Does not come in 60 ft. lengths, or longer.- Shipping was a little slow.It seems that Newegg standard free shipping has really slowed down.  It is now taking much more than a week to get items that used to arrive in 3-5 days."," I needed long HDMI cables to install in walls for HDTV mounts that were run to a central Media Server Location.   These were the longest HDMI cables I could find and they were on sale at 50% off which made the price/50 ft. cable around US$20 with free shipping.   I couldn't find a better deal than that!The cables took awhile to arrive.   I noted that in the Cons section.  Since that was not a product issue, I did not take any eggs off the rating.The Coboc HDMI cables seem to be sturdily built.  The outer sheathing is vinyl so it may be stiff in cooler temperatures.  At normal room temperatures of 20 C or higher, the cable has good flexibility for corners while still being stiff enough to snake it without extra support.  The outer sheathing is not armored, that I can tell so, don't plan on having these last in an environment where the cables are stepped on, abraded, or in contact with a sharp object (like a sheet metal ductwork edge).  The sheathing appears to be perfectly adequate for cable chases or environments where the cable is not abused.I tested the cables before installation and was able to transmit HD video and audio streams without dropouts or apparent signal loss.The connector ends are not positive lock like some cables and adapters.   The fit is still reasonably snug so there is little chance that the connector would come loose in an environment with little vibration or movement.The only negative I can really find is that these cables do not come in any lengths greater than 50 ft.   If I could find some that are 20 meters or more, that would have been perfect.I am very pleased with these cables at the sale price.   I only bought three and will certainly buy more if they come on sale at this price again.   If you need long HDMI cables for non-abusive applications, these Coboc cables should suit your needs quite well.",None,None

In the evening I often get flickers and blanking and I have to turn off the monitor or go back to 1080P. I knocked a star off of the rating for this. But if you are only using this at night for a couple hours no issues. Also make sure you get cables that support the bandwidth, 4K@60Hz requires 20Gbps bandwidth cables.

Price is easily half that of brick and mortar stores."," None for me, but see notes."," This cable is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted an HDMI cable I could run through the attic above my room so I could play certain PC games on my TV without a cable running across the floor, and it does the job marvelously.The cable's size is incredibly important to keep in mind, though. I didn't have any space requirements I needed to meet so I didn't have any problems, but this is not a cable for tight spaces or small form factor jobs. Don't expect it to bend to fit behind a TV that's only got a few inches of space between it and a wall, and don't expect it to fit perfectly around corners. Beyond the cable just being thick, the ends of the cable are also far bulkier than any other HDMI cable I've worked with. I had to switch to a bigger drill bit when drilling holes because of this, but this wasn't a significant issue in my case.I also have no idea how well the signal holds up when you're trying to send extremely high-definition signals over it. The most I've done is 1080p, and it works without a hitch, but as far as I'm aware 35ft is right around the length that signal quality loss starts to happen, so anything above 1080 may not work as well.",None,None

Only one time did I get a clean image, but that was lost when I disabled the other monitors connected to my computer. Re-enabling them didn't help.I know it's a digital signal but the only way to describe the problem is: The image had snow in color transitions. When looking at a still image, it looked like the pixels in these areas were literally running around at random.

The adapter supplied with my Gigabyte card was so thick it barely fit into the I/O shield, and the added length, plus sharp angle of the cable, caused excessive leverage where it fit into the port.So I bought this Link Depot cable, which fits perfectly and has a flexible cable which doesn't strain the port with an unnecessary adapter.Price is very reasonable.The picture on my Pioneer TV looks as good as before, and now I don't worry about damage to my video card.", None I can think of.," Why did nVidia use a port most people don't have a cable for? Supplying an adapter is a kludge and adds another potentially signal-degrading connection.I think Zotac makes a GTX-460 with a full HDMI port, so manufacturers don't have to stick to the spec. Mini-HDMI is more for portable devices like camcorders.You can use the DVI port I suppose, but then you need a DVI-HMI adapeter or cable if you're connecting it to a receiver as I am.",6,6

The cable uses 24awg which is outstanding. No interference or diminishing of quality even over a 25ft cable. Also CL2 rated if you are paranoid about your HDMI cable going up in flames if there is a fire. I'm glad that it doesn't have any type of sleeve around it, harder to bend cables around corners when they are sleeved."," Isn't invisible? Other than that, nothing."," I bought this HDMI cable to go from my computer to my TV, which after taking a few corners is almost exactly 25 feet. I was going to go for a 35ft cable, although it was about $10-$15 more, so I took my chances with the 25ft cable hoping that it would make it. Sure enough after I worked out most of the kinks in the cable, it makes it to 25 feet no problem (with a decent amount of slack left!). The cable cam packaged extremely well, with everything wrapped tight and neatly, and the connector ends shielded to keep from damage during shipping. When I first pulled it out of the UPS box (along with my other stuff), it looked like a snake coiled up. This cable is extremely thick in case any of you are wondering. It's a tad bit thicker than my pinky. It's not as thick as some cables I've seen, but definitely thicker than I was expecting, which I'm actually glad about (less resistance over that 25 feet).

Great Picture Quality., None," I buy many HDMI cables for my consoles, gaming monitor, TV's you name it.  A long while back I purchased this same cable but in the 6ft size and loved it.  It's been the best HDMI cable I've ever used even compared to very expensive ones I've purchased in the past.However since it was only 6ft some of my devices are much farther away so I had to move things closer to hook them up.Which is why I decided to go with these 15ft cables.  And I don't regret a thing.  They work just the same as the smaller one & give me the length that I need with the same picture quality that I expect.These are not cheap but are not expensive either.

I've only had 1 past experience with RoseWill and that was with my buddy's Rosewill wireless USB keyboard. The keyboard itself was extremely cheap feeling and the USB dongle would not even stay in the USB port. Either the metal bracket that holds the USB tip in place either fell off prior to shipping or was not included in the design. We actually had to tape the dongle in place for the keyboard to work.

I have this running from my Receiver to an Acer K11 mini Projector and to my Samung HDTV and it works 99.9% of the time without screen fragmentation or any loss of signal. I dont have a HDMI switch box so I have to unplug it every time I want to use my HDTV. Its eventually going to give out but so far so good and I've had it for a couple months now. Pros: -CHEAP!!         -Very thick insulation          -99.9% reliability (see other thoughts)          -Gold plated connection          -Fast shipping"," At this price its sooo hard to nitpick but if there was one it would be how stiff it is at first. Once you've straitened it out it takes a while to stay that way.  Cons: -Stiff at first          -Not Rottweiler proof, He'll eat it eventually."," I say 99.9% reliability because A few times while watching Avatar in Blu-Ray it flashed some rainbow colored lines across the screen. I've tested several other blu-rays with no issues at all. Picture quality is perfect. Could be a bad copy of Avatar aswell.For this price, compared to retail store prices you simply cant go wrong.

I believe these are rated to go in the wall so that will be a future project but they are currently 95% hidden from sight. Since this purchase I picked up an HDMI 5 into 1 switch. The Xbox, Blu Ray, Camera and computer each have a dedicated line into the switch then to this 45’ HDMI. (PS3 is in the bedroom now…let me tell you how much my wife like that!) The Directv still has its dedicated line. Newegg’s cable deals, with this one at the forefront, should absolutely cripple the big brick and mortar store’s ability to make any margin and turn a profit. This is a best kept secret. But should it be?"," The cable and plugs are thick… very thick. The cable doesn’t handle corners or sharp turns in the cables route very well. As it enters my AV cabinet, the cable and plug doesn’t want to turn and go straight into the components. I think this caused the picture to blink or flicker and, on a few occasions, completely go out on my PS3. This frustrated me for a long time until I realized this thick cable and plug issue. I made certain the cable was as straight as possible from where it entered the cabinet to the point it plugged into the PS3. No issues ever since.",,None,None

This means you are taking a risk for the DVI to HDMI not working properly if you go beyond 15-25 feet. Purchase at your own risk. It really all depends on the AWG of the cable. Judging by the pictures, something tells me this cable is nothing special, and is not meant to run over 3 meters. But that is pure speculation. I would suggest anyone research this product and the specs of both HDMI and DVI before purchasing. HDMI (1.3) to DVI is a about the same... 5 meters. stick with a VGA connection... They can go up to 500 ft without signal loss.",3,8

I think the cable hangs out just a few mm because of the case's metal covering between each PCI slot but I can't see that it has affected the quality.," I get lines in the picture when I have TV AND computer monitor enabled. I probably just need a better video card though. It's fairly easy to disable either the tv or monitor so it's not even a con for my purposes. The cable is THICK, or at least thicker than I expected.

This cable suited my needs and worked for me for about 4 months."," *Failed after 4 months of use, can't return/replace it now.After about 3 months, I decided to take my computer out for a cleaning/dusting, and I noticed the HDMI Cable, where the Gold connector meets the plastic coupling that holds it, had become slightly bent downwards. Since my Video Card was in the middle of my case, it looked like gravity bent it out of the plastic coupling. I thought, ""no worries I'll just move it back into position"" BIG MISTAKE. Turned on computer, and the monitor that was using this cable was completely messed up (garbled images and flashing on and off) I tweaked the plug by jiggling it and got the image to display properly, but there was random green pixels jumping around like it was a distorted video signal. Now after a month of dealing with that, the images have become worst and worst.

The cable came with protective caps for both the HDMI and the DVI side, this is a big plus for me. Picture quality is great, I can even read websites pretty comfortably, However the picture does appear to be a bit more blurry on screen, but that's probably because the pixels are so much bigger, when compared to my laptop."," The digital handshake between my laptop and tv basically automatically setup up the tv as a second monitor, with the resolution set to 1280x720. However, the main issue i'm having is that the picture on the tv is cut off by about 20 pixels on each side. Basically, it's just enough to cut off my whole menu bar across the top of my screen (OS X). This seems like it isn't a problem with THIS cable, but just DVI-HDMI cables in general. In the long run, its not a big deal, since i am using this basically just to watch tv shows from my laptop to my tv (via hulu, or itunes) and video looks great, and isn't cutoff when it's in fullscreen mode."," Configuration: Connecting 15"" Unibody Macbook Pro to Panasonic Viera 50"" 720p Plasma",3,5

When running 1080p video at 60 Hz through the cable, the signal occasionally cut out. The problem was nonexistent when set to 1080i (fine for my purposes) or 720p.

When plugged in to the back of the TV, this HDMI cable sticks out past them (unlike the other 2 HDMI cables back there). We didn't realize this when we were putting the TV back up and the connector got wedged in between the TV and a rail. This ended up exposing the pins and bending them all pretty badly. Using the end of a ballpoint pen (retracted), a needle, and the holes within the connector sheath, I straightened all the pins out and within about 20 minutes had it working again."," Overall this is a very good cable.

Of course, Newegg shipping was spot on, and came in less than three days. The only con, here, is that I am leaving a review here on a cable I haven't yet plugged in and tried. But it looks solid! (I'll come back and edit this post if the thing doesn't end up working, of course!)"," The cable had no particular odd smell to it, nor did it wash the dishes or mow the lawn. Not a good conversationalist. It has one incredibly redeeming characteristic, which is to deliver HDMI signal from my PS3 to my TV. Yes, my PS3 is *very* close to my TV, so the three-foot length is just perfect. A few other people warned about that here already. Here's to my hopefully long-term love affair with this nice-looking cable without spending unnecessary dough!!?",3,10

My HDMI will not work and I don't believe it's the cable. I have two.  I already had an HDMI cable it worked fine. I will say that if you you have HDMI and are not using it you're missing out on what HDTV really has to offer. There is a big difference between Component and HDMI.The reason I can't verify this cable is because I recently learned that those with Motorola DVR boxes (DVR only) have problems with the handshake on some Sony HDTVs and I may have one. It worked and then stopped so it is either the DVR or the TV. I bought this HDMI cable because it was the cheapest part to check. The cable looks well made and I expect it to be fine once I get my DVR\Sony problem worked out.", None at this point," If you are using a Motorola HD\DVR box with a Sony HDTV you should verify that the problem has been resolved before buying, otherwise you may believe you got a bad cable, which is doubtful.

Normally when I turn off the TV that's plugged into the HDMI slot the computer stops reading anything being plugged in there.

Works just as well as more expensive HDMI cables and supports both 3D and 4K monitors.  The 10' length was necessary in order to replace an existing 6' VGA cable (which cost $17) that was unable to be routed out of sight between a new 24"" LED backlit LCD TV/Monitor and the computer case.  Now there are no visible cords between the monitor and the computer case.  Also, the video and sound go directly to the monitor from the EVGA videocard that I installed in the computer, so the old Dell speakers are no longer necessary.", None whatsoever.  Great HDMI cable at a great price that does exactly what it is advertised to do.  Rosewill and NewEgg rock!!!!!!," I still have a hard time believing that this cable only cost me $2.99.  Three to four years ago, a pair of 6"" HDMI cables cost between 30 and 40 dollars.  What is even more mind-boggling is the price of a VGA cable at a local discount store (17 dollars!)  Between cost and capability, this HDMI cable is a no-brainer in comparison to using a VGA cable (if you have an HDMI connection available on both your video card and your monitor, that is).

While other cable/monitor combinations work just fine, this cable proves to be the undeniable point of failure.  After the connection with the TV failed, I made use of a 23"" ASUS monitor and a 23"" Hanspree monitor to demonstrate that the cable is indeed at fault; both monitors work as expected with a separate (much shorter) HDMI cable while neither works with the SYBA cable.

My fault, no doubt, but a more expensive cable could have taken the small force I applied. Suggestion: Go with a six foot or longer in most cases. Never go with exactly the size you need.

Generally, the quality of the product seems alright."," This is advertised as a 4K cable, which it technically is, however HDMI 1.4 only supports 4K at 24fps due to the limited 10.2 Gbps transfer rate. If you want the full 30 or 60 fps of a modern 4K TV, this is not the cable for you. HDMI 2.0 with a transfer rate of 18 Gbps is really what you will need for HDCP 2.2 4K at the proper fps... so I feel like they should specify that HDMI 1.4 is not the modern HDMI 2.0 equivalent for 4K, so when they simply say ""4K"" it does not mean it will support all 4K content, only some of it."," I suspect this cable is what is causing my Roku 4 player to flicker when 4K resolutions are enabled, however I am waiting for a new HDMI 2.0 cable to come-in to test my theory. It works fine set at 1080p (2K).EDIT: I found-out that it was not the cable causing my Roku to flicker at 4K resolutions, but the player itself. I can't blame the cable for that.

N82E16812119233,12-119-233,11/13/2012 8:57:26 PM,Anonymous,Nice suprise!,5," It works! Got a little surprise, read ""other thoughts""It is DVI-D Dual Link cable. I was not sure which one it was from the product description or by reading other reviews, so I took a chance and bought it. It's funny because the product description changed just recently to include this --> (24+1) which kinda says (at least for those who know) it's DVI-D dual link."," None so far. Looks like a quality made cable to me.Actually, I have something to say as a SPECIAL NOTE:Do not forget to change BIOS settings responsible for video output (DVI \ VGA \ HDMI depending on the motherboard to DVI ) for this cable to work!! Especially, do it BEFORE you are gonna use it and when you still have a picture coming from your computer! Otherwise you'll get a black screen and think cable is not working! I learned it a hard way long time ago. I'm just thankful that I had some extra hardware laying around and was able to fix it with the other setup. Now I remember what to change for whichever cable I'm using."," Initially I was thinking to use it to get some video output from ECS HDC-M/C-60 (v2.0) AMD Fusion APU C-60 motherboard with AMD Radeon HD 6290 graphics to my 55'' LCD TV. My TV it not a 120Hz one, but I still decided to get a dual link cable just in case. This TV has VGA <-- (bad image quality) and HDMI inputs and then transmit audio signal by other means. Well... This cable transmitted both video and audio which is out of the official DVI specifications, but was proven wrong by some user's experience with DVI-D to HDMI cables. Now I'm another living example which proves that you can get audio going through this type of a cable. My guess is that it only happens because my motherboard has embedded GPU, but I'm still not quite sure why it works this way so there is no guarantee that you will get audio going using this cable alone.OS: Win 7 Ult 64bit + standard set of drivers supplied with my motherboard on a CD.",2,3

This cable is connecting a Sapphire HD3850 AGP video card with dual DVI-I ports to the HDMI port on a Sony SXRD 50"" rear projection TV. The display resolution is set to 1920X1080 with perfect clarity. The quality of the cable is professional not kidding. I am not sure about the other comments stating that this cable is thin and that Rosewill is a bad brand name. The cable is very thick and has multiple levels of shielding as well as  receives no visible interference from other nearby cables or devices. It appears to have gold plated contacts, although this may be a different metal as the information is not specified the Rosewill website."," None, but I was wondering...If any people who have purchased this cable found it to be ""dead on arrival"" I am assuming that you did not have a good video output to your monitor in the first place??? Is it possible, that your video output problem is not cable related? Have you tested the video output with a different cable, for example, DVI to analogue just to check the ports on the video card and monitor?"," Another great product from Rosewill. They never cease to impress me with the low cost of what I would term ""experimental"" products that are new and innovative. I even chose Rosewill for a 80 Plus Bronze 1000W power supply for my new AMD/ATI gaming rig over other BIG brand names, my case fans, and a wireless keyboard with a 60 foot range (see if you can find that from ANY other manufacturer).

Since my TV has only 1 HDMI that is being used by the Surround Sound System/DVD Player, I have it routed into the second input on the SS system. Well, since it expects the HDMI to provide sound, I cant switch to another input for sound because it is using the one input to route the video, *sigh. But, again, limitations of my equipment here are part of the problem."," I guess as i am writing this, I realize that this product has eliminated the need for the DVD player (Hooray for obsolete technology.....its no Blu-Ray anyways) on the SS System, hahaha, looks like I will be moving the HDMI end of this cable directly to the TV and purchasing an Optical cable for sound.

Maybe I just got a bad cord or there were interference with the little to no shielding, which allowed the cable to made so thin. So to remedy this, I ran the cable straight from Xbox 360 to the Asus monitor, avoiding the two power strips along the wall of the original path. Selecting the 1080p option on the Xbox afterwards still causes lost of signal. *Ran the same cord from my graphics card to the monitor - 1080p was stable and gave signal since signal quality is not only dependent on the construction of the cable but also the signal power source. Evidently, the Xbox 360 does not pump enough signal through its graphic card to keep a 1080p through this cable.", Not 1080p ready for Xbox 360. 1080p works for high-end graphics card.,None,None

I've never had a bad experience with a thickly wrapped or protected and layered HDMI cable.. such as the ones with the no-tangle covering, or the nylon/felt covering.The tips are made poorly unlike other, better structured cords in this price range.. They are not gold-plated and they are not designed for constant plugging-and-unplugging without eventually getting wobbly and snapping or becoming nonfunctional.Within the first 20 seconds of booting up a new Xbox 360 Slim with this cable, on a new ASUS 24"" Monitor, the screen began to go black for 2 - 5 seconds, then turn back on for another 5 - 20 seconds before doing so again. Using this cable on a brand new Alienware desktop setup out-of-the-box, with a 1 yr old Sceptre 23"" monitor caused the same outcome. After thoroughly testing the cable on both these setups and receiving the same results, I won't even waste my time with an RMA. Not worth"," Just go look in the 1 to 25 dollar range for a nice 10-15 foot hdmi cable made by a better brand, and with thicker structure.

The issue really seems to be that people don't know what they're buying.If you're buying an $8 cable, you cannot expect it to physically look and feel like a $40 cable.  Plain and simple.  These cables are constructed fine, not falling apart, connectors seem solid and seat well etc.  Does it look as pretty as a monster cable and have nice quarter inch shielding and hefty connectors etc?  No, because it's a budget cable.  It's like buying a Kia and being mad that it doesn't look and feel like an Audi.When you buy a budget cable, you have to be prepared for the fact that QA is likely a bit lower and you may, in fact, get a bunk cable now and then.  This is what RMA processes are for, and it makes no sense to plug the cable in, see that it's broken, and immediately come here and post a negative review without even trying to remedy the situation first.  Newegg is great about handling RMAs or offering replacements, especially on things like this that cost them so little to replace even for free.  The manufacturers here are generally willing to help too, provided you give them a chance.",10,12

In this case, it's five different lengths of cable – as of the date of this writing, the Top Favorable Review is from the 6 ft. model while the Top Critical Review is from the 25 ft. model (anyone surprised?).  I guess Newegg expects me to sift through 428 reviews and find the ones noted ""… 15 ft."" then average them manually.  I've also seen this practice on a desktop power supply with different output ratings and USB hubs (plural meaning USB 2.0 and 3.0 models bunched together).

Good Build and feels and looks durable.," I purchased this to use on my Television which only has a DVI Input. I used component cables in the past and was looking forward to a more crisp picture on the High Defintion Channels.. but as I found out, my component cables gave a much better picture than this particular HDMI to DVI Cable. I used a friends HDMI to DVI Cable after I used the one I purchased and that cable was in fact better.

Why buy a $30.00+ cable at retail when most of the cables are produced by the same few manufacturing companies, just the outside appearance has been changed. Companies know some people do not buy brand names, Thus, change the name, the look, and market... They still have you as a customer. They know enough people are looking for the highest price item thinking it is the best product so they market ($) high to make their profits higher. A 10' cable purchased here is cheaper than any store in my area sells a 3' or 6' cable for.I keep a extra on hand for any future need or for a friend who is in need.I Have repurchased again, so I do recommend. Will most likely have to purchase even more cables for those who did not know most H.D.M.I . products do not come with a H.D.M.I. cable.", You have to have patience and wait for the product to be delivered if you want to save money.," Measure the distance and buy the proper cable length you need. Don't buy too short. When in doubt, buy a longer cable. Remember, these type of cables were not recommended to bend any tighter than the minimum bend radius specified by the manufacturer of the cable. Thus the reason for some but not all of the comments listed here about cables bad.For the other comments, every manufacturing company has a certain percentage of products that are produced defectively.

May try a higher quality cable just to see if it works better. It's not bad but it is noticably struggling to do a clean 1080p; don't think it can handle it although it shouuld be able to do so.

Currently limited to the time dependent probability of vibrational excitation between bromine diatomics.," The simpler single-trajectory transfer method adequately describes the resonant V to V process in use within the structure of this cable. The proximity of the nearly degenerate potential energy surface leads to a phase coherence time that exceeds the time required for the transition probability to saturate for this model – a term most commonly referred to as latency.  As a result, the transition probability remains a nonlinear function of time, and this precludes the extraction of a rate constant from the slope of the resonant V–V transition probability curve. Hence the data is not transferred instantaneously.",15,19

VGA, composite, coax, etc) where your results could be anywhere from excellent to horrible.knowing that, it's ridiculous and absolutely sinful for retail stores (we know who they are) to charge $60, $80, $100 for these cables. i'm sick from seeing people scammed over and over, thinking more money = better quality picture. it doesn't.the only thing more money MAY get you is better CONSTRUCTION, minimizing the chance of shorts, etc -- other physical flaws that could damage data transmission.these cables are of high enough quality. the ends even come with plastic caps to protect them shipping/storage. i've used all 4 daily for over a year, and none have failed or even shown wear/or any other construction defects."," the only con i know of is that neither newegg, nor the cable manufacturer tells what HDMI spec (version) these cables are. for 9/10 people, this won't be an issue, but i think they are 1.3 or 1.3a. spec will only apply to people who will be using this to connect bleeding edge equipment, as newer specs have more features (that again, only people using the absolute latest technology and high end equipment will even be able to take advantage of).anyone who works in electronics retail knows, accessories, and especially audio/video cables are where the stores make their largest profit margins. cables are marked up hundreds, often even *thousands* percent from what they pay for them. employees can buy these $75+ dollar cables for around $10 or less with their discounts. proof of the insane margins!"," you want to know the simple answer to your simple question -- will this cable be a good one, is it of high build quality, is it sturdy and is it gonna last me?the answer to all of these is -- yes. as said, they have connected my HDTV's, my playstation 3, my computer's HDMI out to my TV, etc... and i have yet to have one problem after many disconnects/reconnects. i kept the plastic protector caps so when they're not in use, i just throw those things back on for good measure. is the packaging pretty? no. it's generic. does it need to be pretty? only if you are willing to pay $80 for a false sense of security.i would only be concerned if this cable will be ""good enough"" if you're using new technologies like 3DTV, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD audio, etc. if this is the case, look for the cables that state any of these features -- ""ethernet channel/3D support/4k by 2k resolution"", to be sure you get a 1.4 spec cable that supports those specific features. otherwise, this cable will suit you.",8,8

In addition, I read all of the reviews for this cable before making my purchase, so my expectation was pretty high and expected this cable to do what it is designed to do. After finish building my new computer, I was so excited to use this cable, but when I connected it with my monitor, monitor would connect with my video card, but screen outputs display like a 256 bit color mode and a monitor turns off after 1 second. Only way to make it show up again is to disconnect and connect it again. If someone doesn't believe me, I'll even attach photo or send you the photo to prove my case. I can't even describe how disappointed I was with this product... I'm quite sure I just received one of those bad product, but the fact that you would send something like this to customer is just bad business model."," In case if your wondering maybe other parts were the one that were not working, I used my RocketFish HDMI cable, everything went great, so it definitely is the cable fault.In case if anybody wonders about what monitor and graphic I was using, Monitor is Asus VH238H Graphic Card is MSI N650TI-1GD5/V1 GeForce GTX 650 Ti 1GB",1,5

I honestly thought they were going to be utterly useless but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. I ended up using 3 of them for our trade show booth because of the long length and lack of clutter.

Low price.," I used this between my receiver and my projector. I got no picture / out of range error on projector. I tried a repeater with an additional 3 foot hdmi cord. Same errors. I hooked it directly to my desktop and along with the repeater, I got a great 1080p picture. I really wanted to run everything through my receiver so I ordered a 30 foot hdmi cable with Redmere from mono...com. I hooked the new cable between receiver and projector with no repeater and got crystal clear 1080p signal. Two lessons learned: 1. The source can vary the quality of the signal. 2. If you run any distance greater than 6 feet, get a high quality cable.",,0,1

N82E16812189057,12-189-057,1/17/2007 12:15:25 AM,Christopher H.,From PC to TV,5, It is what is says it is. DVI to HDMI in a single cable. No need for additional adapters. It's DVI connector fits most non properitary DVI connections found on just about every newer video card out there.  Longer length is worth the extra couple bucks. Cost significantly less than what you'd find in your local Shack/Buy/City.," No option to ""inject"" audio which would only be useful when going from DVI to HDMI. When used in this configuration, you'll need a TV with a connection for HDMI as well as audio on he same source input.Can't knock the cable though. It does exactly what it advertises."," I'm using this to connect my eVGA GeForce FX5500 128mb video card (N82E16814130255) to my Sony KDS-R60XBR2 60"" SXRD big screen TV. My TV has a 15pin VGA input, but that input's resolution maxes out at 1280x1024 which left me with a nice 4:3 square image in the middle of my 16:9 widescreen TV. and besides, it's analog. I wanted DIGITAL. So after about a half hour of messing around with my video settings on my PC and installing PowerStrip software to crank the resolution to 1920x1080 (HD Res) and fix the refresh rates, I was on my way. Even though HDMI is capable of 1080p, I was only able to get 1080i. The manual for the TV says ""Do not connect a PC to the TV's HDMI input."" Not sure why, It looks awesome! However, most of XP's start menu/task bar and the other edges of the screen are not visible. It's like they've disappeared into the TV's frame. A sacrifice I was willing to make. We all have Windows buttons on our keyboards, right?",2,2

You can work around this by grouping like-applications together in port groups, but I'd still rather have a bit more slots to work with."," Right now I'm looking into reflashing it with custom firmware, but I'm hesitant since it's been so stable all this time, I don't want to lose that stability in exchange for some petty features.

I am a former Field Engineer and have been around computers/electronics since 1976 and I have rarely seen a cable fail this way.  The only thing I can determine that the pins in the plugs were poorly electroplated and may have corroded during the few months I used it.The cost of this cable plus RMA shipping back to Newegg wasn't worth the effort.  So I threw this one away and ordered another cable from a different manufacturer."," I ordered a different brand from Newegg.  After installing it, it worked like a champ!  If I were to purchase another DVI to HDMI cable I would certainly spend a few bucks and get a more expensive cable... The cheaper cable may suffer from corrosion easier and more quickly.",4,5

The odds are relatively high, seeing as I've got a couple friends who also had defective cables.I would get about 45 seconds of decent display time, before the screen would flash... then go to a solid magenta color.

Looked good, nothing outstanding though."," It took ten to twelve seconds for it to recognize that my computer was sending it picture upon turning my monitor on.  Sometimes, it wouldn't ever pick up a signal, and I'd have to hard power down my computer and boot it back up.  Essentially, that means it's three to five minutes to catch a display.This same ten to twelve second delay happened when alt+tabbing between anything that's full screen (games such as World of Warcraft or Diablo II in particular).  This was tolerable at first but became insufferable after about a week, as I like to alt+tab to switch songs, or to check the internet for help on a quest or items, etc."," The reason I blame this on the cable, is I brought an old VGA cable out.  The display from the VGA is nearly as good (in my eyes, completely the same) as the HDMI->DVI display, without that annoying delay (alt+tabbing takes one to two seconds, as does powering on the monitor) and for a cheaper price.  I would be wary of this cable.It may have been some weird compatibility issue or something that caused this weird delay, but I wouldn't buy it under that assumption.",0,2

Basically what this adapter is is a 1"" long extension for either a male or female HDMI cable.    What I should have ordered was a female to female adapter.  That way if I pluged in a standard male HDMI cable the other end would have been a female plug."," This is my mistake and will keep the product.  However I don't have the foggiest idea what I will ever do with it.  In fact, I can't even imagine why this product is being manufactured.  If I plug in a HDMI cable that has a female end into the adapter which has a male plug then the opposite end of this adapter is still a female end.

As it's a digital to digital conversion, pristine text and colors are to be expected, but it was still great to see it nonetheless."," None really. If I had to say anything though, it would be that the cable does not carry audio, but that's understandable as DVI never did, so a converter cable sure wouldn't. That's no fault of the cable, just older DVI tech."," For starters, I researched all over to find a cable of this quality everywhere and the prices began in the range of $45 to well over $100. There was an actual store selling just the adapter sans cable for $40. The price on NewEgg was unbelievable at $5.99. Plus even with egg-saver shipping, I got it in 2 days.",None,None

Went through the replacement process though it was only 6 bucks. The replacement have the same issue showing the display on sony 60"" projection. The 16:9 resolutions were extremely unstable. Got rid of this cable and went back to analog thinking that perhaps the TV has issues with DVI to HDMI. Until I found a 10ft. cable from AccStation.com for 8 bucks and free shipping. It did a perfect job on any 16:9 resolution and I found a perfect one for my tv. Though the new cable from AccStation is only running for less than a day but atleast I am sure it was the BYTECC cable that was the culprit.

9SIA8R658N0884,12-270-113,1/9/2009 7:28:16 PM,Anonymous,"Worked Fine, but not using it...",4," Gold plated.  Works fine.  Its digital, so either the image is noticeably pixelated or it isn't.  Good if you want to connect your DVI-capable video card to an HDTV, such as for a HTPC, which I did."," However, many HDTV's, such as my Toshiba DLP TV (with 1080i HDMI inputs) overscan the image, so if you actually set the display resolution to 1920x1080, part of your desktop will be off the edges of the display.  Newer LCD and Plasma TV's do this to less of a degree, or not at all.  Since the connection is two-way, the Nvidia control panel immediately recognized it as HDMI into my HDTV.  However, the TV (or perhaps the Nvidia drivers) are a bit annoying, and insisted on preset resolutions (ie, the ""resize desktop"" setting didn't ever stick in the Nvidia control panel, as it would when I was using component output from my video card to my TV)."," For the reasons in the ""Cons"", above, I ended up not using this cable, although I will be keeping it anyways.  My TV and video card handle high-definition fine with Component output, and the Nvidia control panel is easier to manage using that output instead of the DVI output.  Perhaps if I get an LCD TV in the future (which I hear do not overscan the images so much or at all), I will use this cable then.  Also, if you have a video card that does not support component output, then this is a great way to use a DVI port to connect to the HDMI on your TV.",None,None
